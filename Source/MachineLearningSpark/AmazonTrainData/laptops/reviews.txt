RUSGOFLB5XRWR::The most underrated and un-hyped new system::Google is on to something here, but without a little luck, I would not have known about it. I now own 2 chrome books (one for my wife and one for me) and find the experience delightful. In trying to learn and become more productive with it, I have searched the web for how-to articles, etc. Quite by accident, I came across "The Chrome Book." It is well written, very informative, and a real good overview of the "operating system." It also treats some of the higher level uses.This was my best find yet, and one that I am buying as a reference book. I just hope Google keeps going with this concept with enhancements, improvements, and more advertising. Again, well written book and on target!::Walt Baty "Walt 0000"::5.0::January 10, 2012
RAM6A980S6YMK::Excellent!!::This is a great intro. to the subject of Chromebooks!It's helping me decide if I want to take the plunge(I probably will).Update(7/16/12): I took the plunge! I like my Samsung Chromebook(see my review) & this book was a big help to me!After a month of owning my Chromebook, I still refer back to this book.::Poor  Audiophile "Poor  Audiophile"::5.0::January 30, 2012

R212K0UDHZY44A::Could be a life changer::I have experience with almost every OS out there.  I purchased Andriod and iPad, looking for the perfect flexible, easy to use PC replacement.  No luck. Even a Bluetooth keyboard its not enough to replace the PC as a heavy typing/real work tool.So I purchased a Samsung 5 550.  I already used Google Apps extensively, and this was a natural extension.CH Rome's book gave me a fantastic look into the concepts and methods of using ChromeOS, as well as a detailed step-by-step method for using it.  It actually changed how I use computers.  My 'My Documents" folder is now my Google Drive folder and I have file access from my PC, Chromebook, iPhone, iPad, and any PC I log into.I use the Chromebook as the heavy typing tool now, as its so fast and easy to start and stop, and stay where I was. I use a wireless mouse with it, and it feels so comfortable!  I could not have known all these capabilities were there without the book.  I can honestly say that less than $6 and a few hours of reading changed a huge aspect of my life.  Not many books can boast that claim.::Snowbirds::5.0::September 23, 2012
R6GIPSHI7QUUY::Not useful if you know about the Internet::Disappointed.  I bought this after I got my ARM-based Samsung Chromebook to learn more about ChromeOS and how to make the best use of my new laptop.  I wish I had just used Wikipedia and an Internet search engine and saved myself the time and money.  If you know how to use the Google Chrome web browser and Google Docs then you are ahead of the game already.  Highly recommend the Samsung Chromebook for a netbook computer but the dated information in the book leaves much to be desired.  I don't think I learned anything new at all.::KWL::1.0::December 4, 2012

I'd gotten a Google Samsung Chromebook for Christmas & this book increased my excitement about my choice.

OS X aquaface is absolutely stunning, and all the new products for OS X such as Microsoft X, Acrobat 5, are 10 X better to look at than their predacesors of OS 9.  I can't wait for Photoshop in OS X!  The speed with the preinstalled 256MB Ram is a little too slow for my taste, but after installing a 512MB/PC-133 dimm to bump me up to 640MB, I am cruzing at lightening speeds. Even Mac haters have admitted to me being enchanted by the outer and inner appearance of the glamorous icebook.  Oh, the second one purchased is my husbands (a die hard Windows user)!

RI1HRABZC3U54::Shockingly fabulous...::An exceptional product and an excellent deal. I recommend getting some extra RAM anywhere online, very easy to install yourself. Fabulous graphics, the screen is perfection, great sound, wonderful word processing, iTunes, iMovie, the greatest two operating systems, 9.2 and X. It's beautiful and useful to anyone. Perfect in every way. And weighs less than five pounds. Surpasses all of its price and tech counterparts.::E. Meadows "liz"::5.0::November 2, 2001
R1QMPDGJHHRM6::iBook::My iBook is everything I expected it to be. It's not the fastest portable Mac, nor does it have the biggest screen. But it is inexpensive and eminently portable. the battery life is typically in the 3+ hour range (Under OS 9--OS X's power management needs work.) The keyboard and trackpad are comfortable, and it is very small and light. I use mine on a college campus, and people balancing huge Dell "laptops" are always gawking at this lean notebook. My only complaint is that the latch broke--it's under warranty, and it doesn't impede function, but it's irritating.::null::4.0::December 23, 2001

I wish I could afford another [$$$] for a G4 powerbook, but since I can't, I got this one.  I can't believe the power, versatility, and the attention from others.  As someone who writes software, and attends school full time as a law student, this computer does it all.  My only complaint, hard-drive is small, so I bought an external firewire drive to store non-essential data.  Dang, firewire is fast.  Also, I have an iPod.  It is of no "Practical" use, but try and take it from me and ....well.... the won't let me say it here.  Let's just say, I love it.BUY and APPLE, if you can afford a G4 powerbook, get one.  If not, trust another developer the G3 is still kick - a**.::Brian Doyle::5.0::April 18, 2002

R1S40LH7VR7LZA::Basic 500 MHz iBook::I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.::R. G. Michel "rgmichel"::5.0::November 25, 2001

Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday! I have used several desktop models, including a G4 at work, and the quaint, quiet iBook has out-charmed them all. One other thing: at home I use a full size keyboard & mouse, and external speakers.

R1S40LH7VR7LZA::Basic 500 MHz iBook::I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.::R. G. Michel "rgmichel"::5.0::November 25, 2001

R2QM507XUNB7CW::My Favorite Computer!::This is my first laptop, although mine specificly has the dvd/cdrw combo and the 20 gig drive. I bought it to replace my then 6yo 9500, which died of burned out motherboard. The iBook was supposed to be a temporary fix, until a G5 desktop came out. Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday! I have used several desktop models, including a G4 at work, and the quaint, quiet iBook has out-charmed them all. One other thing: at home I use a full size keyboard & mouse, and external speakers.

But finally, I'd had enough of the Windows anti-trust and not to mention the problems with the actual Windows OS. So finally, I decided that I'd get a Mac. The perfect choice for me was the Apple iBook. Since I got it, I've discovered that my choice was a good one. The only problem I've had is that AOL seems to crash a bit. Otherwise, the Apple iBook is basically the greatest computer I've ever used.

R353A8IFETO8ZX::The perfect compromise::You can't have everything. At least, not at 1,199 bucks.The bottom-of-the-line iBook is exactly what it should be: Extremely portable and extremely friendly. Extremely fast? Not.This is a compromise machine -- the screen is small and the processor is the slowest available on a Mac. At 12.1 inches, the screen is among the smallest you will find on a laptop nowadays, but it is super-sharp. And the fairly pokey processor is still more than adequate for word processing and iTunes and some basic graphics applications, and for surfing the web. Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4.

I primarily bought this for web browsing, Microsoft Office, editing photos in Picasa and my iTunes library. I have had 30 windows open, run iTunes in the background and was typing a document and it could handle it all without lag. I have even run Adobe Photoshop CS3 and it does alright as long as the projects aren't too complicated. I did try the photomerge function (in Photoshop CS3) with 20 photos and then the program finally choked. All in all, if you're looking for web browsing, streaming netflix, a computer for your iTunes library and some basic photo editing with Picasa then this is a pretty darn good computer for the value. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming or graphics work. Also, the speakers are pretty quiet so you'll definitely need to invest in some speakers. I picked up a pair of compact USB Insignia speakers so I can travel with them and they work a charm! I would definitely recommend this computer to someone.::N. Kanakis::4.0::September 16, 2011

R2IRX56CMYM5ZS::Very very poor service::I purchased the computer in January of this year.  The connection for the charger on the computer got lose by July and was unable to charge the battery.  We asked repair.  We needed to send the product to Asus, wait for the product to come back for 2 weeks.  When we received the computer back, we noticed that the original problem was repaired, but half of the keys on the keyboard do not work.  So, I called the Asus and waited for my turn for approximately 15 minutes on the phone.  When a human finally picked up the phone, I explained the situation, asked the possibility of in house repair or replacement.  The call taker took all information from me, including my phone number, serial number and so on.  Then the phone was disconnected.  Nobody called me back.  So I call them back.  Another person picked up the phone.  I asked if my information is already in their system.  The guy said no.  I asked if the original call taker would call me back.  The guy said Asus does not perform call back services.  He told me if this phone is disconnected, I have to call them and wait on the line of callers again!!  I asked the same questions to him, if they would replace my computer or send a repair man to my home.  He said they do not replacement and asked me the situation and all my information.  So I told the same information for the second time.  After that, he told me to send the computer in and it is the only way they cover manufacturing warranty.  If he told me the answer from the first, I would not have wasted the time on the phone!!!  Now, we will wait another 2 to 3 weeks for the repair.  Their product maybe OK for the money, but the customer service is definitely worst!!!!  I will never buy their product.::Health Consience::1.0::August 5, 2012
RTCKBYC0ROFBM::Excellent Computer / Excellent Value::I recently purchased the Toshiba L675D-S7052 laptop for my daughter to use in college. After reading some reviews I was a bit nervous, but went ahead anyway.I am not disappointed with this purchase. In fact, I'm quite pleased.I have a lot of confidence in Toshiba Satellite laptops. I started off with a Compaq, years ago. It was nothing but trouble. When I replaced it, I purchased a Toshiba Satellite. I have stuck with Toshiba ever since. I have found that they are a hardly piece of equipment that just keeps going...and going...and going.One of the things that concerned me, with some reviews, was the claim that this laptop is flimsy, bendable and liable to all sorts of bad things. I have not found that to be the case whatsoever. This laptop is nicely protected and is made out of a decent, sturdy material. It appears it can take a beating - bouncing around in someone's car and backpack. I'm both comfortable and confident giving this to a teenager.I am a fan of AMD processors. In my experience, I have grown to prefer them over Intel processors. This Phenom II - Dual core processor appears to have plenty of power and speed. One thing my daughter requested, was that she could play games on it. She made me promise her. Guess what? This little laptop does just fine.I am not too happy with the fact that this Windows 7 (64bit) version regularly sucks up 1.2 gigs of RAM just to operate. But then again, it comes with 4 gigs of RAM and is upgradable to 8.  If I decide to add more RAM, it will take me all of one minute to install it.One of my main concerns was with the number of USB ports. Many of the new laptop models only have two. That made me nervous for a couple of reasons. One, laptops get hot, so we're going to need to plug in a cooling pad. Two, some external hard drives require two USB slots to power themselves. Three, beside the other two...where is she going to plug in her mouse?I didn't need to worry. I sat the laptop on the kitchen table all day long as I updated Windows, installed software and tested out the system. After sitting on the table without a cooling pad for 8 hours, i picked up the thing and it was still cool. I mean...really cool. My personal laptop gets so hot you need a cooling pad. After running hard for 8 hours, this little unit felt like it was still sitting at room temperature. This is nice.It is also my understanding, correct me if I am wrong, but the newer external hard drives are back down to one slot. However, even if I am wrong, we still have three to play with. So, if it takes two to run an external hard drive, we still have another slot for a mouse.Here is a nice feature: Ever had trouble with a laptop when you are typing and the cursor moves all over the place because of the pressure on the keyboard? I have experience this with IBM, HP, Compaq and Toshiba units in the past. However, on this unit...just below the space bar...there is a tiny button that can disable the built in mouse pad. When you want to use it again, just press the button and it starts working again. Nice!Only thing I didn't like very much, was that the keys seem to show fingerprints easily. However, they are easily wiped off.The 17 inch screen is beautiful.I am very pleased with this purchase.Awesomeness: Price, screen size, hard drive size, low heat, thinWhine Factor: No Blu-Ray, no Bluetooth::T. Brumwell "TS Brumwell"::5.0::January 16, 2011
R3BEXNNOYCPVLA::Toshiba lies about HD space::This laptop has two partitions that you cannot remove if you ever wish to restore your PC. The total amount held by the partitions is around 10GB, if something happens to these partitions you will not be able to install Office that comes with the PC, or worse restore your PC. If your HD goes bad you will have to pay Toshiba for your install, even if you have a Win 7 Home install CD Toshiba blocks the Key unless it is installed from their media. It drives me nuts that you buy a laptop, and then have to jump through Toshiba's hoops to keep using it as expected.Also the performance in high resource usage apps is terrible, far worse then a computer with these specs should be. Web surfing and Office work fine, but anything that puts a consistent load on it like photo-shop, or games with requirements well below what this laptop has causes this PC to sputter and heat up like an oven.  It must be a cooling issue, or cheap architecture, PC review sites have noted this issue as well. Don't say "Well this a laptop, not a gaming PC", the whole point of the upgraded AMD Vision is for 3d acceleration, but it's pretty much unusable and only adds an insane amount of heat.::Nathan Reinhart::1.0::December 16, 2013

R2KOJ84AIT41O0::WARNING!  NEVER BUY A TOSHIBA LAPTOP!::After owning several problem-free Compaq and Dell laptops over the past 15 years, I made the mistake of buying my first Toshiba, a Satellite L675D. I admit that I was enthralled by the 17" display.  Big mistake. HUGE MISTAKE.  Less than four months after purchase, my wife opened the laptop one evening and the screen showed a crack in the upper right corner.  I sent the laptop to the Toshiba repair depot and they claim she accidently damaged it and they want $325 to repair it.  BTW, the entire system only cost $530 brand new.  According to Toshiba Customer Relations (and I quote) the "accident was caused by opening the case too hard".  I asked how that was even possible. Seriously, how do you open a laptop too hard? Toshiba said (and I quote), "you could have pulled too hard". If anyone from Toshiba is reading this, refer to T1-1174583 case # 110 331 001 320.  I swear these are exact quotes.  I currently own several Toshiba products, but after this experience I will never purchase another Toshiba product of any type in my lifetime. And now whenever I see someone even looking at a Toshiba laptop in Best Buy, HHGreg, WalMart, etc, I will warn them not to even consider Toshiba. Stick with manufacturers who stand behind their products. Toshiba is not one of them.::tomintechsupport::1.0::April 6, 2011
RQ5E2GS19P3DV::Get what you pay for::I needed a basic laptop for web surfing, email, writing, and some light computer programming. I got this one at Best Buy for about $[...]. For the price I found it to be a good buy. It came with the 64 bit version of Windows 7 and had two gigabytes of memory, a single core AMD 64 bit processor and a two hundred and fifty gigabyte hard drive. Uses shared memory for graphics.After using it for about a week I became frustrated with the length of time it took to boot up and another while for your program to load. Once your program was loaded, it would run ok but I did not run more than three programs at once. It also seemed relatively easy to stress the processor. The system monitor would indicate processor usage was at near one hundred percent by merely installing a program. The battery life was respectable and the built in wireless worked very well. I found the keyboard and touch pad to be a bit odd but I quickly got used to how they worked.One peeve I had was that the initial memory came in two one gigabyte modules. It would have made more sense and been cheaper in shipping the laptop with a two gigabyte module. I however do not pretend to understand the business decisions of these computer manufacturers.Bottom line.Good value for the price but recommend increasing the memory to at least three gigabytes to work well. Good for light use around the home or at the office. I have not tried but I don't recommend games on this unit. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could but I cannot seem to give half star increments so three stars it is.::Darin D. Sheriff::3.0::December 5, 2010
RP46TSZB0RGXE::Versatile Mobile Machine::My initial needs which lead me to purchase a laptop were mobility, media storage and playback  (HD and non HD), and 3D modeling using Google SketchUp. I was looking to spend around $450-$500. After some research,this model kept making the comparison and with the price, it started looking like a winner. I made my purchase and I have never been happier. The screen is the right size for mobility, without sacrificing it's viewing capacity. Having a discrete graphics card, while not the most recent of architecture, coupled with (shared) 256mb from the DDR3 memory it performs quite well. I have to say it this laptop runs SketchUp almost as good as my desktop rig Core 2 Duo 3.0ghz 8gb of RAM and Geforce 9800GT video card. In all fairness, Sketchup is 32bit and can only address 2gb of ram, and is only a single threaded so alot of what you think are advantages to my rig, they are infact not. I guess the point of this review is..... this laptop does a couple of things at a time really well. If you push it, it will perform like a cheap laptop. If you want to surf, watch Hulu, and model a spaceship in Sketchup, she will perform like a much more expensive laptop.I should also mention it plays Age of Empires III, Starfleet Command 3, and Command & Conquer First Decade quite nicely.ProsSolid hingesBattery life is excellentLightweightRuns cool and almost completely silentexcellent performanceUsable gaming capacityConsNo HDMIno webcamOverall I am completely impressed.::Matthew Rajotte::5.0::January 5, 2011
R1YBMGP8JZCG6M::Cq56-115dx  Joke is on Hp and Nvidia::Well let me start by saying that this laptop i got from the Nvidia settlement. It was to replace my dv9000 specific model 9428nr. my old computer had a 2.2 GHz AMD Turion (tm) 64 X2 Dual-Core Mobile Technology TL-64, 2Gb of ram max, and a 17 screen display, and that problematic nvidia chip, dual hard drive bay. use to do a lot of work on it for engineering classes it went well and it did everything i had to, but then it started having the classical problems of losing the wireless and over heating. by then my warranty had expired from best buy. So i was stuck with a half working laptop and it was not too old is was about 2.5 years old. so then i got a letter in  mail that there was a legal class action and that my laptop qualify for an exchange for an equal laptop in value. So i said why not and i ended up sending it to the Nvidia settlement. So when i got my cq56-115dx i was for some big disappointment.cq56-115dx came with a 15 inch screen, a single core amd V140, able to upgrade to a max 8 GB of drr3 ram, ATI 4250 graphics (not bad).NO second bay for a secondary hard-drive. NO express card, No 5-in-1 integrated Digital Media Reader for Secure Digital cards, No  Expansion Port 3. and NO Number keypad on the right. Maybe i could have life without some of things, but what really got me mad was the single processor of the cq56-115dx. REALLY???? what a way to make it to customers who were having problems with the faulty nvidia and who paid $1200-$2000 for these laptops.Performance of cq56-115dx as is no sugar coatingfirst of all you must upgrade the ram of the computer to a max of 8GB if want to be able to do some multitasking. with the 2GB of ram that came, multitasking was so painful.After you upgrade the cq56 to a max of 8gb the computer runs a lot better. I was able to run engineering programs and do other things at the same time. but for more demanding programs the computer began to lag a lot. For example if you only run a program at a time then the computer is fine, but if you want to listen to youtube while running a demanding program forget it. solidworks with youtube on the background and some pdfs open equals total lag. Something i was able to do with my older computer.Running videos on youtube at 1080 p is a total lag.Last time i tried to run HD video on gametrailers web page, nothing else open, there was so much lag that i had to switch it make to standard view.People who are going to use this laptop for Microsoft word, power point and internet they should be just fine.bottom line this laptop will run great if you run a greedy program at a time, real multitasking is not existent with the cpu amd v140.So i search to try and see if any possible upgrade here are the possible  cpu upgradesAMD Athlon II Dual Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP320 2.1 GHz AMP320SGR22GM 25WP340 2.3 GHz AMP340SGR22GM 25WAMD Turion II Dual Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP520 2.3 Ghz TMP520SGR23GM 25WP540 2.4 GHz TMP540SGR23GM 25WP560 2.6 GHz TMP560SGR23GM 25WN530 2.5 GHz TMN530DCR23GM 25WN550 2.6 GHz TMN550DCR23GM 35WN570 2.7 GHz TMN570DCR23GM 35WAMD Phenom II Dual Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainN620 2.8 GHz HMN620DCR23GM 35WN640 2.9 GHz HMN640DCR23GM 35WN660 3.0 GHz HMN660DCR23GM 35WP650 2.6 GHz HMP960SGR23GM 25WAMD Phenom Triple Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP820 1.8 GHz HMP820SGR32GM 25WP840 1.9 GHz HMP840SGR32GM 25WP860 2.0 GHz HMP860SGR32GM 25WN830 2.1 GHz HMN830DCR32GM 35WN850 2.2 GHz HMN850DCR32GM 35WN870 2.3 GHz HMN870DCR32GM 35WAMD Phenom Quad Core Mobile Danube- ChamplainP920 1.6 GHz HMP920SGR42GM 25WP940 1.7 GHz HMP940SGR42GM 25WP960 1.8 GHz HMP960SGR42GM 25Wwhere copy and search  on ebay HMP960SGR42GMso at the end i bought a dual core amd phenom IIx2 N640 clock at 2.9 Ghz for $56 plus free shipping. let me tell that you what a big difference it makes. true multitasking, and now i can play hd videos without any lag. not to mention that i now have the ability to play some games.how to replace the cpu amd v140 for a amd phenom IIx2 N640first flip the laptop upside down on a table remove the battery. Now get a standard star screwdriver and begin to remove all the screws that you see on the bottom of the laptop. As you are taking them off remember where you took them off from. the ones with a little brown mark are bigger and thus correspond to the outer perimeter of the chassis. the little screws with blue are attached to the mother board and thus belong to inside. remove all screws even where the battery was before. Next open up and remove all screws of hard drive and remove hard drive itself. Next open up where the ram goes and remove the ram itself. remove the wireless card which has one little screw and is attached with two cables one grey an and one black or cable 1 and cable 2. double make sure you remove all screws, the hard drive, the ram, and wireless.flip the laptop and open the display you will remove the key board. you will need a flat screwdriver if you look top left and right corners between the speaker panel and keyboard. place the flat all the way down and begin to lift the corner slowly then move the flat screwdriver to the other corner so that it becomes detached. Make sure you do not pull to hard on the keyboard as you lift tilt the keyboard and see the ribbon attached to the motherboard, finally carefully remove the ribbon and the keyboard (if you forgot to remove a screw you will have a hard time removing the keyboard and you might break it) . now remove the dvd drive just with your finger get hold of the dvd-drive and pull the dvd drive out, it should come out completely without any problems. next look where you just you took off the keyboard there are about three ribbons you need to disconnect (make sure you do it). after that with fingers of flat screwdriver began to detach the top part of the chassis off the bottom part thus exposing the motherboard (color blue). once you see the motherboard remove and attached cables to the motherboard about 4 or 5 cables remember where they go. DO NOT REMOVE THE SCREW OF THE DISPLAY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO REMOVE THEM. There are two physical screws on the motherboard take them off and lift carefully the motherboard. make sure to bring down the display because it flip on its own weight. So flip the motherboard on the back you will see the fan and the cpu. remove the cable of fan to motherboard. remove the screws of the fan. finally you will see the cpu with a flat screwdriver twist to let go of the cpu lift it up and carefully put the other back in. make sure you apply thermal paste (arctic silver only a little then with you finger spread it, it the cpu is a bit dirty clean ( clean the silver square)it with a little of alcohol and q-tip before placing it and putting thermal paste)and tight back the cpu with the flat screw driver. then began to put everythig back together. If you have open up computers before then this will be very easy.10 mins to take everything off and another 10 mins to put everything back to together. if for some reason you do not place ribbons securely your computer wont boot and will just stay on the black screen with the fan running only and the caps lock key flashing light (happened to me. secure everything). so after you place everything together you should be able to boot into windows normally and start using the computer normally. you should have  a better cq56-115dx.Cpu $56 plus now about $40 8 GB of ddr3 ram, you are looking at $100 to make a good Cq56-115dx.the ram i bought is crucial 8Gb kit 2x4Gb 204-pin SODIMM 512x64 DDR3 PC3--8500 CL7I am happy now with cq56-115dxwindows rating6.1 cpu7.1 ram5.3 graphicsbenchmark of passmark of cpusold laptop--2.2 GHz AMD Turion (tm) 64 X2 Dual-Core Mobile Technology TL-64  1049cq56-115dx--amd v140 single core @ 2.3 Ghz  674cq56-115dx--amd phenom IIx2 N640 @2.9 GHz  1794having said all of this, hp has no quality control and what they did to us in the nvidia settlement is very very unacceptable by all standards.its a slap on the face and on the hard earned money of people. and worst part was that my old computer was a gift from my mom and the money she wasted.  If i did the same poor job i'll would be fired from my job, but hp and nvidia have gotten away with a poor job. Hope this information is of some help to others. for me its the last time i buy another hp laptop.::Jesus S. Mijares "MECH"::4.0::January 15, 2012
R1ME3ADD68TG5X::Great Laptop for a Great price::This laptop is the best one in its class. Its processor is fine for the price. The ram is very fast(should be upgraded to 4 or more gigabytes to give this laptop its full potential) the hard drive is fast, but without a fast processor it is somewhat slow. the graphics card is wonderful, it actually can play WoW and many other games without lagging. The wifi card is fast as well(thank god for n wireless).The battery can get 3 hours on serious usage, and about 4:15 on very low usage with the brightness all the way down.This laptop is the best of the cheap. If you need a computer for word processing, mail, Internet browsing, and the occasional game, the price is right for a great laptop.::Juan Gonzalez "¿huh?"::5.0::January 4, 2011
RDRAROVBAR7X0::Pretty nice...... IF YOU UPGRADE THE RAM::I purchased this machine a month ago. Mine came with the AMD processor... As an avid fan of AMD/ATI I had to grab this one. The only thing I did not like is the fact that the onboard peripherals use too much of the installed 2 gigs of ram leaving only 735mb of ram for the operating system and your software. I quickly upgraded my ram to the maximum 8 gigs and this thing runs sweet... It will chew up almost anything I throw at it; Games, 3D modeling, multiple OS's under VirtualBOX and high end multimedia... Great value for the price but it needs better and faster memory than the stock it ships with.::Spatry::4.0::February 16, 2011
R3LC99BXW18GCM::This is a fantastic laptop for the price.::I got this laptop for christmas and i ADORE THIS THING.It can play my entire steam library on high settings. (The msot graphics intensive game I have is Left 4 Dead 2, so...Yeah....Runs great, and everything. Bought another 4GB of RAM. Waiting for it in the mail.::Ryan Carr::5.0::December 31, 2010
RSBH0VE4SDHVP::Decent once modified::My previous laptop was running on an Intel Celeron M processor (1.6ghz) and was in the process of dying  (speakers burned out, blue vertical line on the screen and the hard drive was acting up) when I purchased this one.  Since this computer was running on DDR3 memory with a faster processor I expected more in terms of performance. It does run faster with some limitations,shortly after I purchased it I notice that if I played video (not hd) and started up the browser (mozilla) the video would run sluggish for a few seconds and if I opened more browsers or did not put a check on my multitasking it would get worse.Recently, I upgraded the memory to 8gig and the sluggishness during multitasking is less noticeable. I am using this computer to do some video editing, I am converting some VHS tapes to avi format and it is handling the conversion fine- VHS converted to VOB using a standalone dvd recorder then converting the bloated VOB file to avi on the laptop. While the video conversion is taking place I can do other tasks but the computer runs very sluggish so I just let it do that single task alone.  The video editing is the most demanding task that I use it for  while the others involve, besides browsing and watching video,  word processing and using the spreadsheet software. If there is anyone who can tell me/us how we can possibly tweak the win7 64bit system to get maximum usage of the memory please inform us.I am not witnessing any of the slow startup time mentioned here, I have disabled certain programs in startup, particularly some of the proprietary HP programs that are not really needed and have altered some of the frivolous visual effects, I really don't need transluscent menus or rectangles to operate.I also have quite a bit of backup software including a version of win 7 64bit so I do not have to rely on the recovery software located on the partition.I actually have no real problem with the keyboard I have to admit though that from time to time I keep hitting the key for the calculator. As another person commented I too like the matte finish. The screen size is slightly smaller than my previous laptop but I have no real complaints and its brightness is adjustable.  I somewhat miss the sd card slot but my camera has a usb chord and doubles as an adapter. I do not use the touch pad, never did on my previous computer, I have a cord usb mouse that suits me just fine.I would have rated this four stars but I find it difficult to support the notion that those of us who purchase this product, are forced to accept the proprietary software without any option to purchase it without it.::E. Brown "Hugh"::3.0::May 17, 2011
R3S1J57ZGS4LLW::Get a better one::I got this free of cost from nvidia-HP settlement after my dual core dv6113us's display broke down. I would advise anyone looking for a laptop to buy a better one from HP even if you pay $100 more. If you open 2-3 applications at one time, it slows down. Does not have HDMI output. My old laptop had s-video output normal for a 2006 laptop. Battery life is very very poor. The mouse buttons are very hard to press (looks like 1990s technology). I am using an external usb mouse. There were a few issues installing Windows-7 updates but I got over it. I like HP but don't buy this one to save a few bucks. I have a HP desktop running Vista and it performs very well. My old HP laptop that ran XP was good too.::Sridhar Devulapalli "Devulas"::2.0::June 5, 2011
R2L7KJGADRIILV::Performance and best price::When I purchased this laptop I was thinking about the price, I just had 400$ to invest, definitely it's a good choice for the low price, no overheating, good performance, 64 bits windows, Norton internet security 60 days free, practical to work, just one detail: no webcam...But it's just that, a detail, no big deal if you're looking for a laptop with excellent performance to work, even if you use graphics software like Corel and photoshop, another possitive point is its big display of 15.6 inches with an excellent graphic interface, ATI radeon 4250 HD will give you an unique experience..If you're looking for good performance to your job or university at a low price, this is the right choice...::Rosangela::5.0::April 19, 2011
R2XN0AS1AOX7C::Great value for the price.::I've had this laptop for a few weeks now. I bought it as a cheap desktop replacement to use mainly for internet and mild gaming. I'm very satisfied with it. Mine boots very quickly and runs smoothly so I have no idea why others say it takes awhile to start. Windows gives it a 4.1 rating and that's because of the lowest rating of the graphics with Aero. The graphics (Radeon Mobility 4250) in games are surprisingly good. The touch pad has a good sensitivity and response. The matte finish does a much better job at hiding fingerprints.Windows Experience RatingsProcessor: 4.3RAM (2GB included): 5.5Graphics: 4.1Gaming Graphics: 5.3Hard disk: 5.9The negatives for me are the stiff click button and the fact that's it's one bar so you have to click on the extreme left and right for it to work properly. Also, the battery doesn't last very long. Much less than the 3 hours it says. The screen is extremely reflective. Overhead light and sunlight make it very hard to see. Low indoor light with lamps works best. The quick buttons on the left of the keyboard are pretty useless to me.Games I've played on it:The Sims 3- medium settings [...]The Lord of the Rings Online- medium settingsPerfect World- medium to highPS, I bought this new and upgraded the RAM to 5GBs which changed that rating to 6.3::Ms Milk::4.0::February 17, 2011
R1UHQNZFWDPD7V::You Will Not Like This Computer::Hewlett-Packard should be ashamed of this product.  First the good; it has a nice keyboard.  Now the bad. Noisey fan. Mouse pad buttons are so hard to push they are almost useless.  But worst of all is the speed.  This computer is painfully slow, and is totally unable to handle multiple tasks. I realize it is a low cost computer, but this is a computer for people who e-mail and web surf only. Pass on this computer.::Ray Mercier::1.0::April 30, 2011
R29XO98KRWRVW0::Complete junk::I got this computer for free because HP sold me a defective computer that turned into a brick due to a design defect with the graphics chipset.  I sent back my defective computer and I got this as a replacement.  What an insult.  If you long for the days of your 600 Mhz Pentium III computer, this will bring back memories.  It is that slow.  The LED screen is fine for casual web browsing but does not accurately render colors, so don't use it for photographs or anything.  You'd think that a computer with such a weak processor and an LED screen would at least get some pretty good battery life, though.  Nope.  A full charge is good for about an hour to an hour and a half, even with the screen dimmed to the minimum.  Apparently, the models have an option for a webcam, but for those that don't they don't even bother coming up with a screen bezel that doesn't have the hole for the webcam.  They just stuck a piece of plastic in the hole that kinda sorta matches.  Good enough.Good job, HP/Compaq.  You managed to come up with something even worse than my Pavilion dv6000!  But, in your defense, it wasn't as if I would have actually bought another one of your products after the way you treated your customers with that nvidia fiasco.::N.W.::1.0::April 8, 2012

R3PQ8T63DQ33IE::Bought a Laptop with Non-Functional Keyboard::I would be cautious of buying anything from this company. I am an IT professional and needed a test laptop, therefore, I bought this one at a reasonable price. I was able to plug in my extra keyboard and use the laptop screen. But when you type on the actual laptop keyboard, it skips, adds extra spaces and types in the wrong letter. I believe in what you do to others will come upon you as well. The bad thing is I cannot take it anywhere and use the keyboard. I have to always use the extra keyboard.::Tina Maria::1.0::April 22, 2014
RRXZGH0608XNU::works well, for a while::I understand that budget is a big factor when purchasing a laptop...especially if you are a college student, or if your looking for an easy computer to do basic tasks. Keep in mind though, if your paying for a cheap laptop now, you'll be paying for another one within a couple years. That being said, i'm only giving it 3 stars because it worked nicely when we first got it. It slowed down quite a bit if you had more than a couple programs running, but I could compromise. What concerned me is how often the fan would come on, and how hot the machine got without a vent beneath it.These days the fan is constantly running, and CPU is through the roof (frequently at 100%) for no apparent reason, even upon start-up or with just a web browser on. It sounds like a small jet is sitting in my lap. It struggles having only 3 browser tabs open. The battery life was so-so initially, but since it runs  so hard these days it eats through the charge in no time flat. I've tried a number of things to clean it out and speed it up, but with little impact. And it's not like there's a lot of files on it either...minimal downloads, had virus protection, no more than a few gigs of photos. This laptop has had it pretty easy but it acts like it's going into cardiac arrest.I never write reviews, especially bad ones, but I have been battling with this laptop for almost 6 hours just trying to run a simple program to get my homework done and have gotten nowhere. I decided to restart it, and it was 'updating' for 45 minutes before I just shut it off. I started it up again, and it was 'reconfiguring' for another 30 before I shut it off again (yes I know that is terrible for it but I am so done with trying to cajole this machine into working properly). So now it is working on a startup repair (for 20 minutes) and I'm sure it will keep at it well into the night.For sure, there is no way I'm getting a Compaq again. I totally get trying to save money and purchasing a cheaper laptop, but for something that is going to be pricey anyway you might as well save up for a computer that is actually going to work well for a reasonable amount of time. This thing sucks.::Jessica::3.0::December 16, 2013
R1379BB80ND0CC::Worst laptop ever::I've bought this laptop new, and it has since given me nothing but trouble. And from reading the web, the issues encountered are very common. First of all the fan is prone to clogging and the paste used to cool the processort is badly applied so overheating is common. Next the motherboard has poor build quality. The laptop is prone to booting problems due to the motherboard having loose connections, bad quality of solder, etc. Avoid this model.::r3500vdp::2.0::October 14, 2013

R2PKJJW61P2Y69::Good starter laptop::FYI, Compaq Presario CQ56-115dx can be upgraded to at least an AMD Athlon Phenom II N970 2.2 Ghz Quad Core Processor, even though the documents, and some articles in the HP forum and elsewhere state that the max upgrade is the AMD v-160. I have done this myself and have noticed little increase in CPU temps and little effect on battery life. There are 2 processors that are better than the Phenom II N970,; However, they are the extreme editions and I wouldn't count on them working(BIOS sup).Enjoy.::kyleg001::4.0::November 30, 2012
RPKAKZTTYXE10::Too hot::I got this laptop as a Christmas present about a year and a half ago, and I have never been happy with it. I didn't have internet for a while which made my usage short with using only paint, solitare, etc. However, when we finally got our wifi hooked up my computer immediately slowed down, I don't have a lot of documents, pictures, and only 3.7 GB of music, yet if I use the laptop on my bed, floor, couch, or even a wood desk the fan kicks in very loudly and it becomes hot to the touch, I have been forced to unsafely take the battery out to turn in off to stop it from burning me. It has terrible playback for dvd's, I have never watched one without it skipping, do not buy this computer, if you have children, dvd's, or want to do anything other than play solitare.::Carlycan::1.0::July 5, 2012

R3E48NQRUCR8UL::Low price shouldn't mean low quality--but it does.::I have an old Samsung flip phone that cost around $30. It has survived my abuse for more than a year, including being dropped into a koi pond. It was cheap, but it is very well-made and reliable.The point of this digression is that a small price tag doesn't have to imply poor-quality merchandise. Plenty of low-end products offer solid builds; the savings comes from cutting out bells and whistles, but not (necessarily) sacrificing the quality of the materials that make up the product.Sadly this is not the case with the CQ56. I bought mine for about one hundred dollars less than what's listed here. My desktop PC was fried in a storm and I needed a new system in a hurry and on the cheap, and on that level the CQ56 fit the bill. And the thing is, it was just great for six months and more. It has just a single-core processor, so it's no powerhouse, and there was always a little lag opening Firefox. But generally it was just fine. I wrote a bunch of papers, did a ton of grading, and even some simple gaming on it. It always ran very hot, something I'd read about in other reviews online, but I was careful to keep it on flat surfaces, and on the few occasions when I watched movies in bed or what have you, I made sure that it was well-ventilated.I was running Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit). Everything was great until a week or so ago. The fan kicked on, making a ton of noise; the system heated up again; and from that point on, nothing worked. Safe Mode would run alright, but of course, Safe Mode is not a permanent solution. At one point the PC took more than twenty minutes to boot in normal mode from being powered off. Programs would take insane amounts of time to run; even switching between active windows was slowed nearly to a stop.Thankfully it was still under warranty, and it's currently being repaired by HP. But based on this experience, and the time lost for repairs, and the very real risk that I won't have my PC back before heading abroad for a research trip in a few days, I will never again buy anything from Compaq. And again, before you say "You should have known better--it's a COMPAQ," I repeat my earlier claim: lower price doesn't have to, and shouldn't, mean lower quality. But in this case it does, and that's why you're better off giving another company your money.::Wanna-Be Buddha::2.0::January 17, 2012
R3LCPNQOIQOJO6::Very Low Level PC::Like many here, I received this laptop as part of the nVidia settlement.  While I agree it was a very poor replacement for my old laptop (mid-quality 5 years ago, but it least it was a dual core), the reviews should be about this particular PC and not our displeasure with the settlement.With that said, this is a real piece of junk, IMO.  I work on computers all day long, repairing and installing new machines.  I haven't come across a new PC this bad in years.  It is EXTREMELY slow.  I do quite a good job at eliminating unnecessary startup apps and killing most of the unnecessary visual effects that sap performance quality.  Still, this thing just drags and drags.I gave it two stars (instead of one) because of its very low price.  It is probably adequate for those who use a computer for email and a bit of web surfing.  But this machine ships with only 2GB of RAM which is barely enough for a PC with a good processor running Windows 7.  I will probably end up adding a few more GB to the RAM and that will help the performance a bit.  But if I paid for this computer, adding the RAM would make it closer to $400.  For less than $400 you can get a laptop that is FAR better than this.  I think with a bit of smart shopping you can probably score a better laptop for $300 or so.One may think speed isn't important if all one does is email and a bit of web surfing.  True to an extent.  But you still have to update it and install some programs.  You will find these simple tasks take forever to finish.  (I'm not talking about the download time.  I have a very fast cable broadband connection.)I will end up giving this (or selling it very cheaply) to a friend who has no computer.  But I will add RAM before I can even do that as I can't in good conscious give this to anyone the way it is.My advice:  Steer clear of this laptop.::The Dean::2.0::August 10, 2011
R11JDSUJN7DEL::It is cheap::Reminds me of the infamous IBM Chiclet keyboard - bad if not awful. Mouse pad buttons are totally useless. Screen is probably the only nice thing about it.

RBJE6LA6MSUC5::NEW is NOT New::I received the item before the stated date.  Great.  The issue I have is that I paid for "NEW" condition.  When I received my item, I noticed "refurbished", and "reconditioned" all over the box/packaging.  I immediately contacted the seller (Electronica Direct) about receiving the wrong product.  I was informed that this item shows up "NEW", because Amazon assigned a NEW SKU/item number on an existing refurbished item.  Electronica Direct was very helpful in every way and offered an exchange or refund immediately even it not being their fault. They've informed me that this model isn't even sold in true new condition anymore.  The SKU is in plain site on Amazon, yet Amazon still lists this in NEW condition.I have yet to open the box and mess with the actual product.  I just felt I should warn others before they go about purchasing this (and selecting "New" condition) expecting a brand new product that never needing any tampering.  Thanks.

RT4JPPQJXCTXP::You get what you pay for::I work from home and needed a replacement laptop that was inexpensive until I could afford a better one. The CQ56 serves that purpose just fine. Cons: The computer itself feels tinny when you type and you have to click awfully hard on the mouse buttons. The speakers are not great and it runs a little slow. Pros: It is suitable for light computer work. It connects to wireless networks fine. For the price of a netbook you get a full size screen and keyboard.

RDZTH5RCVEOYO::what you have::is really a jumbo netbook with dvd with performance only little better than intel atom.Fortunately for people that are in market now there's many new generation of much faster processor/video alternative with good battery life.For sub $400 now, you can get 3gb+  320gb+ harddrive with hdmi (east tv connection plus accelerated video).All with great battery like 4hr+ etc.Avoid V and E series from AMDIntel i3/i5 are great, new generation(2011) laptop pentium are good.Amd A series are good, turion II are ok...If you see dedicated/discrete video ram for extra $20-50, go for it since that will give burst in multitasking/video.So there is not much reason to get slower one like this.::K.

RGRFQMUYMPMYK::Compaq (HP) Customer Service SUCKS!::DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OR ANY OTHER COMPAQ OR HP PRODUCT. Unless of course you feel like being charges exhorbitant fees to ship the product you bought thinking it would work back to them so they can fix it.  They DO NOT stand behind their product.  You will pay them $35-40 to ship a product that is defective OUT OF THE BOX to them.  One would believe that they would take responsibility for building something incorrectly and make it right.  You would be WRONG.  Those of you who get one that works, you are OK.  If by chance yours does not work as it should, you get to pay MORE for a defective product.  Congratulations on a terrific policy HP!  Nice customer service!::Rob N.::1.0::December 27, 2010
RQ4YP0JJAMOBM::Very Satisfied::I was looking for a new replacement laptop and bought this one from Best Buy, party due to the many good reviews it had.  I have been very satisfied.My old laptop chugged and chugged on the hard drive, and I had decided that my next laptop would have a 7200rpm hard drive for the speed factor.  However, I never found a laptop I liked with a 7200rpm hard drive.  Furthermore, after doing research on hard drive speeds, I found out that a 7200rpm hard drive is not necessarily faster than all 5400rpm hard drives.  This laptop has a 5400rpm hard drive, and I have been very satisfied with the speed.My old laptop did not play videos well, stuttering on full screen standard def videos due to low processing power.  I decided that my new laptop would need to handle 1080p full screen videos smoothly, and so far this laptop has been doing that.As I researched new laptops, I noticed that some laptops seemed to get too hot.  I have been impressed with how cool this laptop runs.  Now mind you, you have to give it proper ventilation.  If you are smothering the bottom by having it rest on a blanket, it will get warm/hot.  But if you have it on a flat surface like a lapdesk, etc., it runs relatively cool.  It's even cooler than my old laptop.My old laptop had static on the headphone port, so I wanted to make sure that this one did not, and I have not noticed any static.I'm glad I got this laptop, and I would recommend it.::listener::5.0::December 14, 2010
R1192UG9RX6C07::Good laptop, but not long-term::I bought this laptop as a replacement a year and a half ago.  It has worked very well for me since then, no problems with the system.  However, the hardware has slowly deteriorated over time, just from regular use.  The screen hinge on the left side has loosened and when I went to open the laptop today, the hinge ripped a bunch of the plastic off the corner of the screen and the corner of the laptop itself.  Another issue I had was that the charger plug also came loose, causing the laptop to not recognize that it is plugged in.  Overall this laptop works well, but the hardware issues after long-term use that I have had would cause me not to recommend it to others.  The hinges especially appear to be poorly made.::Frosty::3.0::April 18, 2012
R1092ZU06NBHZA::Good value for the money though ergonomics are not ideal.::I have probably been through a dozen or so laptops over the last 19 years so believe I have a little experience.I purchased the Gateway a little over a month ago.  It is for personal use at home, not business.  Primarily for web browsing, email and as a mobile media center.  Overall, I give the Gateway high marks.  It appears to be reasonably well constructed with a good feature set and represents a good value.  The blue ray player and HDMI were important to me and appear to work fine.Saying that, I would probably return it if it were not outside the 30 day policy. It is a personal thing but I find the ergonomics to be lacking.1.  The keyboard does not feel right.  I am a fairly proficient touch typist (50-60 wpm) and continually hit the wrong keys.  I haven't pulled a ruler out but believe they are oversized.  Anytime I place my fingers on the keyboard, I have to search for the little nubs on the "F" and "J" keys to confirm my hands are in the right place.2.  Mouse / Touchpad - Again, I can't get this right.  It does not fall naturally to my hands so the use is awkward.  It does not feel intuitive to me and, in fact, is counter productive.If I had to use the laptop for an extended period of time to actually do work, an external keyboard and mouse would be a requirement.Another personal preference I have discovered while using the Gateway, what is ideal display size.  This is the first laptop I have had with a 15.6" display and it will likely be the last.  It is just too large and bulky for a laptop.  My wife (who has a Compaq with similar display) tried to tell me this but I disregarded.  Wish I had taken her advice to heart.  I think a 14" is just about perfect and that will be my next laptop.I don't want to sound like I am bashing the Gateway because it is priced very competitively with the features I wanted and has been completely trouble free.  It just doesn't feel right and will probably sell soon unless I can find a way to adjust to it.::goldenrool::4.0::February 16, 2011
RFS49NVW4VNZ2::Fast, loaded, great deal::I have good luck with Gateways in the past and this one is another real winner from the value standpoint, with a fast, cool running CPU, plenty of memory, a spacious and fast hard drive, n-wireless, plus Blu-ray and Wimax built in, you cannot beat this laptop for the price.It's the only i3 laptop so equipped at this price point that I could find.Setup was a breeze, thanks to Windows 7's near painless setup procedures. Almost no crapware to get rid of beyond the ubiquitous Norton Anti-virus (use free Avast or AVG and save the ridiculous yearly fees charged by Norton et al). Exceedingly quiet, as most laptops tend to be, and good battery life....about 4 hours when new. Not the best but not bad.Don't need wimax yet but I tried it and it works. If you can afford the hefty monthly fees and live in area where this is available, it might but worthwhile. Nice to have if you need it in the future.Keyboard may be the only downside. As a touch typist, I don't particularly like the square flat chicklet keys, but for those who want a stand alone numeric keypad, it's there on this larger than usual laptop keypad.Screen format is 16:9, great for watching Blu-ray movies but shorter than the usual 15.6-inch screen. Screen quality is good but not great. There's HDMI out for connecting to larger screens.Some don't like the satin "espresso" (brown) finish but it like it better than the shiny piano black of my old laptop, which showed every finger and palm print.  Touchpad works OK, supports gestures.Very good built in speakers, best I have ever heard on a laptop. Special "social media" key for launching all the usual suspects in one keystroke.A good deal for the money.My 5 year-old core2duo Gateway is still cranking but decided to upgrade because the battery was toast and wanted to move up to Windows 7. Hopefully, the new one will be as reliable as the old one, which cost a third more and is a bit heavier.::DaytonaDan::4.0::January 11, 2011
R1HA1UPX3DDG5C::Good bang for your buck::Bought this laptop for my wife for Christmas 2010.  After 11 months of use the only issue I have is that it is slow on occasion.  The screen is good, battery life is ok, blu-ray drive is great, and has plenty of memory and hard drive space for everyday computing.  Built in camera is okay, maybe 3 out of 5.::dahlers2::4.0::November 19, 2011
RK1YDY94XNNPK::Nice::I was able to buy this laptop for $499 a few weeks back.  I really wanted to purchase a Mac since that is what both my wife and I use at work.  Our tired old Toshiba was ready to go but I just couldn't bring myself to pay 3 times the amount for a MacBook Pro.  This laptop has been a nice addition.  My wife uses it the most but we have used all the features.  The screen is clear and the machine is fast.  My wife really likes the style of the keyboard ad claims it is easier to type.  Anyways, this machine seems to do the job.  Very pleased that I got it for the right price.::A guy::5.0::January 28, 2011
R2LAVYS67J797N::awesome notebook but keyboard and touch could be better::pros:- fast and smooth- runs much cooler than all my other laptops i have had.- has blu-ray drive and wimax- was cheaper when i bought it, w.r.t to the other laptops at that time with similar specscons:- keyboard keys have non-standard size (little bigger). This is a problem for typist.- touch pad is very sensitive, and cursor very often point at random places and clicks randomly as a result.overall:- for the money v/s value, this was definitely a good buy.- i'm impressed- Gateway should, however, work to improve the keyboard and touch pad.::GoodFella::4.0::April 1, 2012
R34G4W3XZYZY4T::It's the right laptop for what I wanted 4.5*::Wanted a 13.3" laptop, something smaller than my 17.3" Toshiba and larger than my Acer Netbook.  The 17.3 is too big for travel and netbook has several limitations and requires external drives.  Started looking for a reasonable 13.3" but found this HP dv5-2135 DX midsize unit is slightly larger (.5" wider) than a 13.3" and had everything I was looking for, so I ordered it.When it arrived my first impression was it was physically larger than I thought and I too at first had a hard time with the sensative touchpad.  But was soon relieved when I compared it side by side with the 13.3" and I have aclimated to using the touchpad, yes it is different from those used in the past.  Learned to use only one finger as the buttons are part of the pad.  The screen is very bright which is good for persons of a certain age, ha ha.  Contrary to some others comments, I really like the keyboard it has good key spacing for my large fingers, is positive to the touch and I very seldom missed keystrokes compared to the high dollar Toshiba!  The wiFi has been flawless so I can't understand why someone complained unless they had a lemon.Now, was this the perfect laptop?  Has anyone ever found the perfect laptop? In my application it's as perfect as it get's and I would highly reccomend it.If I didn't have the learning curve with the touchpad I'd give it five stars, I gave it four, as there is no way to give it 4.5 which is where I think it belongs.JerryB::Amazon Customer::5.0::December 9, 2011
R99RW1A2V9AO::Why all the negatives.::omg. this is a great computer. the screen is bright. the speed is fantastic. the wifi is good. check your own router. all i can say is that it is a very good laptop. there are some things u need to know about this laptop. the battery lasts about 2 hours. the mouse is sensitive but thats good as u do not need to press hard to operate it. the sound is a little soft hence a reason for headphones jack. the keyboard is fine. it's called an island style keyboard.so to sum it up very good laptop. have it about a 10 months. got it for university. works great for all my projects and etc. the entertainment aspect is great also.games can work.::Eddrington Allen::5.0::October 30, 2011
R1NFFMKE7P9ZEJ::Nice but a couple glitches::Nice screen, keys are well spaced so if you have larger hands this is just the ticket. The built in mouse is jumpy and just a pain. Buy this computer and plan on getting a usb mouse soon thereafter...::SteveE::3.0::June 3, 2011
R1XGNB4XL74QOP::Average::Overall laptop build and performance is good.But there are two major issues because of that it becomes a no buy1. It makes too much noise and heats up very fast.2. Audio output is not audible with all the noise process makes.This can't be called an entertainment laptop if you can't even hear a thing in it.::Ankur Varsheny::2.0::June 20, 2013

R18BXAH4N9HWNP::Don't Even Think About Buying...::Don't even think about buying this laptop. My largest complaint is that the wireless connection device in it is horrible and cannot establish a decent connection for more than 10 minutes; you have to stop whatever you are doing to fix it every time it is disabled. This is not a router problem. All the other wireless devices in my home connect just fine. Another problem is that the keyboard is horrible. I am a fast typist (around 90+wpm) and I have had to stop to correct the letters that were not registered at least 15 times thus far in this paragraph. I am an English student, so I have to type a lot of notes and papers for classes.  I got this laptop on sale at Best Buy for around $550, but this is something I would have payed about $200 for. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP; IT ISN'T WORTH IT.::SilentSinger::1.0::August 14, 2011
R1MNYT43U7SWQK::It is just ok.::I have owned this PC for 3 months. It is not the worse laptop, but it is not very useful for work. The keyboard is horrible. Typing requires you to type very slowly and with great force. If you try to type by touch at a decent rate (30+ words a minute), you will find that many of the letters that you typed are not registered. Additionally, for a entertainment laptop, it is difficult to open the cd/dvd door. The Sound is not that great for even a laptop. I would not recommend it to someone.::CSE::3.0::January 18, 2011
R1520SOERBP8XN::Excellent Computer::This is a great laptop. I looked for a while before settling for this one, and I'm not disappointed. My HP died after only 2 years (after the warranty expired of course!) so I wanted to change brands. I settled for ASUS because they have the best reliability reviews among all manufacturers, and it was $550 at Fry's! The Intel core i5 makes this machine run like a breeze. Its screen is brilliant with great color gamut and contrast. The keyboard is chiclet style, and very comfortable. It comes with a numeric keypad, some people may find the keys a little too small, but I find them very useful. I've been running intensive processing software (Seti@home) and the keyboard never felt too hot, core temperatures stayed between 72-79 C. The fan is very quiet and never got too loud even when processors were running at 100%.Pros:Fast processor (comes with Intel's first i5 generation CPUs)Bright screenQuiet fan, keeps cool.Great keyboardNumber padCons:Reflective screen, can be bothering if you have a strong reflection.Poor sound quality: the speakers are on the front, but face downwards, so they give an awkward sound.No discrete graphics card, but at this price, can't complain.Overall, I am very happy with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone.::M. Moyano::5.0::July 6, 2011
R12Z2MS96YA65F::Do not purchaser without a warranty::I've had my Asus G73JW ROG-A1B5N since February 2011.  Since then I've had to have it serviced once because of a cracked display, for which I have no idea how that happened.  That cost $600.00+.  Now the display won't work at all, even plugging in a secondary display won't work, and now the machine won't even come on.  Lesson learned, do not buy Asus, and if you do, don't buy a machine without a warranty.  This is the first time I've ever had any issue with a lap top and I can't believe I've problems twice on the same machine.::Civ Player::1.0::August 16, 2012
R2PIP8TGBW0XYK::Great product Asus needs to work on customer service.::Where to begin,I bought this gaming laptop on Jan 28th, 2011 and so far it has been great. I has not been without its faults however; unfortunately most of those faults lay with Asus customer service and support. Shortly after receiving this laptop I found out through my own research that a recall was being issued on it *Sandy Bridge Recall*. To make a very long story short I was never notified my Asus of the recall even though I registered this laptop the same day I received it. When I began emailing Asus with questions about the recall no one knew ANYTHING about it and I was send around to other departments several times going on over a few weeks before I got to someone that knew anything about it. At one point in my transfers I was even told by 2 separate support/tech personnel that the recall was already performed on my notebook even though my notebook was part of the first batch sold even though the S/N look-up said mine was part of the recall. I did finally end up getting it figured out and sent in and was in continual contact with one of the people overseeing the recall and was told the day it arrived in their hands that I would have a replacement sent out in a couple of days just to receive an email from someone else the following day that stock was gone and it would be 2 weeks before they would get more. After complaining several times a "rush" was supposedly put on my laptop just and instead of it being 2 weeks is was 12 days and it shipped ground.  Nice rush  So to sum all this up laptop is AWESOME but Asus really needs to get things figured out and maybe get rid of the dead weight and hire some people that don't make up stories. If you don't know when, how or why something is happening or how long something will take don't make up a story just tell the truth and maybe offer to find out and get back to the customer and if it is going to take a lot longer then is reasonable then offer some kind of compensation to your customer... I am 27 and it feels like no one has any pride in their work anymore! I know to some people that sounds strange coming from someone as young as me but I take pride in EVERYTHING I do. Want the world to be a better place start by taking pride in your work and be honest!  PleaseOh and another thing about this laptop Asus includes a 1 yr accidental damage warranty on it if you are like me and are afraid of destroying a $1500+ laptop buy and extended warranty though square trade.  They are AWESOME people and really stand behind their service.  The day I received my laptop and I activated my extended warranty though them *3yr accidental* I received a call from them not automated an actual person welcoming me to the service and asking if I had any questions or concerns that they could address; I have NEVER had any service provider to that.  And before I send my laptop in for service I called and asked if I needed to do anything special to transfer the warranty from my current laptop at the time to the replacement all they wanted was an email or fax from Asus documenting the exchange. Then when I received my replacement square trade called me to make sure everything went well.::PhOeNiXcRyOs::4.0::July 14, 2012
R11ATATK889W84::DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THE 3 STARS::I agree its frustrating when people write reviews on products they haven't purhased, but after reading some of the negative reviews towards ASUS and Amazon, I felt I should clear a few things up.First, most people don't realize it, but we have all been buying ASUS hardware for a long time.  It's a safe bet that about 80% of the computers on the market have some piece of hardware made by ASUS.  They have been manufacturing hardware for most name. brands for almost a decade now.  So to say ASUS crap is kind of ignorant.  They actually know what they're doing, but as most people understand, every computer is going to bug out on occasion for any numbers of reasons.Secondly, at the same time, listen to what people are saying and don't buy the G73 version since it obviously has problems.  The best way to avoid this is to pay attention to what you're ordering when you order it.  It clearly states this is the ASUS G73.  I've always had great experiences with Amazon, but granted, they should probably pull this model and not sell it.I'll be buying this laptop on Tuesday and will leave a follow up review on my experience with the laptop.  But if its the G73, know ill be staying far away.::SENRISA::3.0::June 10, 2012
R38YRPLX2HHPBG::ASUS G73  "I am speed"::Fast, quiet, beautiful screen, backlit keyboard, dual drives..  Simply awesome product.  I can believe how cool this I7 notebook is. I is like a luke warm cup of coffee after hours of operation.  Almost cold!  In a quiet room I can barely hear it run.Boot up time is 35 seconds.  Yeah it is heavy and it is not small, but I bought this as a desktop replacement and the capbility to do video editing in HD.  PERFECT.If you want speed, power, beauty, quiet, cool and cool looking... get this if you can.::Speedracer::5.0::February 22, 2012
RCBOL56GZINM3::The Asus G73SW is awesome::I have been using the Asus G73SW-A1 for almost a full year now and found it to be an excellent system and haven't had any major reliability problems with almost all of the hardware. With the 8GB of DDR3 RAM(up to 16GB), two 500GB hybrid drives from Seagate, i7 proc, Nvidia graphics makes its specs nice and high for the cost of the machine especially now that it is a year later.  The only down side I have had is that my BD combo drive started to fail within 4 months and now one of my hybrid drives failed just a few days ago. I do not count these failures harshly against the system things like that happen with hardware every once in a while. I figured it gives me an opportunity and reason to upgrade them to something more my style like a SSD and a full Blue-Ray writer. I did think that the wireless card should have been a better type like one that can do both the 2.4 and 5.8 gigahertz spectrum. There are a few that Intel makes that I like however you will have to install another wireless antenna to gain the benefit. The two true CON's that I would say it has that is it comes pre-installed with a lot of extra software that I would consider bloatware (which I removed) and that support can be less than great. Overall I would say that this system is again excellent, well made and even to some extent upgradable. I give it 4 of 5 and I would have gone 5 of 5 but the minor things with the Hard drive  (to me) brought it down just a little.This system did come out during the Intel Sandy bridge chip-set problems but it has the REVISED version of the Sandy bridge chip-set so no need to worry.::TC-nznk::4.0::February 18, 2012
RKMV199XJ9PP0::Fail::One week after the warranty expired, the motherboard and dc adapter failed.  Repairs will cost $1000.My husband bought the same laptop.

R597F444N325M::Speedy Gonzalez::I love it.  Fast, looks good, no fingerprints all over.Couple of little things:1. When I received it there was nothing to operate the camera with.  No software.  I tried downloading but nothing worked.  After te second call to ASUS support (one was immediate answer and the other was a probably 20 minutes or so)and they found I had no software/programs installed.  Duh.2. Support people are little short tempered and snippy.3.  Support did't recognize the model or s/n I gave them - they did't match in their system.  The he11's up with that?4.  The G73 is supposed to be a desktop replacemment.  Right?  Then how come the damned audio out phono plug is right in the front left hand corner?  Dumbest thing I ever heard of.  I'll need to find a 90 degree angle converter.  Why not go out the back?  USB inputs as well?5.  Tried to play BC2 but it is a bit jerky.  Not sure if it's my eyes or lag or not being used to the LED screen.  Just can't get the hang of it.  Tried different rez settings to no avail.  I hope BC3 plays better.Other than those small quirks, I love it.  Good luck.::J. Reese "shawply"::5.0::September 14, 2011
R23DCTT8444PFQ::Great mobile PC::Great graphics; great performance (NovaBench 1130 out of the box) for a mobile/all-in-one system.  The only system I found with the features I wanted (2nd gen i7, Nvidia graphics, 8G mem w/2 more open slots, 1Tb disk, USB3, and BD) for under $2000.  Excellent cooling - no problems using this baby on your lap.  Keyboard is not bad to use and the lighting is a really nice feature.  After ~2 months, everything still works as represented.  Minimal bloat-ware.This thing is big (including PS); but it's a 17 display and appears to be well built.  It is a laptop (as you can use it on your lap), but I would not want to carry for work everyday.  Battery life is acceptable (for the configuration) at 3+ hours under continous use.  A great buy for a higher-end mobile PC (laptop).::D. Russell::5.0::July 25, 2011
R1871YCAA2TTBD::Best Laptop I've Owned!::I just had to take 5 minutes to say I'm very pleased with this notebook pc. I did a lot of research into a gaming notebook with the prime factor being performance vs. ergonomics. In particular, I wanted a quiet & cool notebook that I could use on my lap that didn't sacrifice performance. I'd gone the custom built route in the past, but often times that high level of processor/graphics power comes at the cost of a hot and noisy experience. Not in this case.My only hesitation was the talk of the 'sandy bridge' issue that existing in some of the earlier models. I've had mine a couple months and so far no issues (I think I'm in the clear by now? I guess it's an issue that doesn't manifest itself on day 1). Anyway, this is a really an A+ machine that I'm happy to have paid the premium for it. Great job ASUS...keep up the good work!::Jason::5.0::July 23, 2011
R3UH9R2D15B6HL::Amazing::This computer is very well made, looks great, and it gives you a great gaming quality and sounds. Also a good computer to have just a regular computer.::Dan::5.0::July 17, 2011
R1AFVAG3UPV0Q3::Beware of Faulty Hardware and "Repairs"::First off, this laptop is a wonderful beast. If you've looked at the specs, it should be obvious it is a phenomenal product on the inside plus a very desirable 1920x1080 super-bright display, extremely loud speaker system, back-lit keyboard, backward-facing exhaust vents (this was a huge bonus for me), etc.I'm still very in love with this thing because it offers all the feature and more than I was hoping I could find in a single laptop. In fact, it doesn't seem there's any other laptop on the market with equivalent specs. The speed, power, and useability make this a dream machine.All that said, I've been sorely disappointed with some persistent hardware malfunctioning. The wifi adapter very frequently drops its connection for no apparent reason whatsoever. By "very frequently" I mean I normally can retain a connection for up to 5-10 minutes before it disconnects for about 30 seconds then reconnects. All other devices on my LAN have no connectivity problems, so I know it's just the laptop. I also tried using the ethernet adapter to mitigate this issue, but the odd thing is the same thing happens with that. This might not be a noticeable problem to some, but I imagine it would be an annoyance to most, especially since this is a gaming notebook. (I have never done any gaming on it, however. I often use it for work which involves using persistent SSH connections to remote servers all day and night.)The other hardware problem is that the trackpad horribly malfunctions. At first it just started moving the mouse in strange places or zooming in/out unexpectedly or clicking when I'm trying to just move the cursor or by not moving at all. Then after a while, the trackpad and its buttons just stopped working altogether. I mean they were completely nonfunctional.I love the machine a lot despite the connectivity issue, and so much so that I even purchased a USB wifi adapter to use on the laptop. But those things are pretty flaky as well and once the trackpad was busted, I considered returning the thing, however I was well beyond Amazon's return policy would allow.I started an RMA with Asus via their website. I just had to provide the serial number, purchase date information, etc. and a tech support person emailed me to troubleshoot. When installing all the firmware updates he recommended didn't make a lick of difference, they had me ship it via FedEx to their repair center (on their dime, of course).I received it back under a week later with only a strange single sheet of paper inside the box. It lists a bunch of checkboxes for possible repairs they could have made and only "Replaced LCD Monitor" was checked. How odd. I didn't know how replacing the monitor could fix the ethernet adapter, wifi adapter, and trackpad, but I cracked the thing open and gave it a whirl. To my surprise, all seemed keen... for a little while.I was a happy camper. I had the perfect laptop I knew this bad boy could be. I left some SSH connections open as a test for over 48 hours and they never disconnected. Using the trackpad is always accurate.Now here I sit 2 months later and all the same problems have returned. I phoned their tech support line and they opened a new RMA for me and I'll be sending it back in for in-depth repairs tomorrow. I'm hoping for a better, more permanent outcome this go-'round. Will update this review with any new info I have.As an aside, I'm not sure why people have had given so many horrible reviews of Asus' tech support. I've dealt with them via email and over the phone and I've never had any problems with them. They seem to be pretty responsive to me.Oct 24, 2011 UPDATE: ===========================To update the status of my laptop, I sent it in the second time and they replaced the wifi board and the trackpad. Upon starting to use it, the wifi disconnection problem was worse than ever, dropping my connection every 2 minutes. Plus, the trackpad they put in had a broken left mouse button that made no physical click and you'd have to pound to make it execute a click.I sent it back in for the third time about a week later. I received it back from this 3rd RMA about 10 days later. This time they replaced the hard drive, wifi board, trackpad, and LCD panel. I didn't have much time to test my wifi connection because soon as I turned it on, I realized they must've put the wrong LCD panel on because I could not achieve my previous maximum resolution of 1920x1080.The very same day I received it, I spent about a few hours updating Windows and all the drivers and another hour on the phone with tech support starting my 4th RMA. I sent it out the following morning and am still waiting on getting it back for the fourth time...This just isn't right. At the very least, one tech support fellow informed that if I return it one or two more times for the same issue, they will send it back to headquarters and give me a new one... So, now I'm hoping it will continue not working for me.It's an incredible machine and it's far superior to any laptop I've ever used or owned in every regard, except for these manufacturer defects that seemingly can't be resolved.::Amazon Customer::1.0::September 14, 2011
R1X8KFSQJBLYDP::Great Computer At First - THEN NOT!::I have had my computer for going on 5 months now, and for the first 4 months it was amazing!!!! THEN, the mouse started freaking out - unresponsive and randomly re-sizes the screen. There is no hardware or software fix for it outside of using a physical mouse. Now, it won't charge. The computer cable is useless - the pins inside are falling out. I will NEVER invest in this type of computer again! My husband bought the newer version at the same time, and the pin fell OUT of the charging area, and the screen is busted!! UPDATE: It's been over a year now, and this review is still the same. It was a truly amazing computer to begin with - none better. Now, it overheats and melts a soldering point inside, which makes the charging cable useless (we've had it fixed twice now). The warranty ran out after a year, so the first repair was covered. Now, I pay $50 every time it happens. PLUS the touch mouse is completely fried - no solution for that. Not to mention, you MUST use a cooling pad under it, or it overheats with use and shuts off to save itself. It's not well built, and the guy that took it apart last time said it looks scorched inside because the overheating/electrical issues are actually cooking the innards! I'm looking forward to buying a new laptop :/ My husband's laptop has the exact same problem (the newer version of the same model). His is in the shop for repair now, another $50 :(::Amber Nicole Steward "Nickiemay"::1.0::September 2, 2011
R37QY8P5EGO5GJ::Buyer Beware::I purchased this laptop on 4/5/11 directly from Amazon and received a product affected by the sandy bridge recall.  I was hesitant after reading some of the other reviews, but went ahead and ordered out of good faith.  Upon opening the package, I noticed that there were no recertification stickers to be found anywhere.  After finally getting the Asus support website to load, I confirmed that my laptop was indeed affected by the recall.Edit 1:  Amazon is unable to exchange the laptop (not that I'd trust them to ship a re-certified model), but offered a refund.  This requires me to pay for shipping back to them, at which time they estimate the refund will process in 10-15 business days.  Not exactly thrilled about having my money tied up so long thanks to their willingness to ship a pre-recall laptop.Before I dealt with Amazon's support, I attempted to do an expedited recall through Asus.  Asus support is by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had.  They couldn't fathom that I had formatted and performed a clean Win7 install prior to realizing the laptop was affected by the recall.  Who wouldn't want their notoriously bad software, right?  The CSR talked down to me while possessing the trouble shooting skills of an infant.  They couldn't even figure out how to create a case number to begin processing the recall.  You'd think that would be something they've dealt with quite frequently as of late.::Chris Jones::1.0::April 6, 2011
R19VLDQEK0B6OO::DON'T ORDER THIS COMPUTER::After hours of research I decided to take the plunge and get this computer.  The computer specs wise is great and its a sharp looking gaming laptop.  I read the other reviews and from the comments its seemed safe to order and the computer wouldn't be the re certified version.  WRONG!  Right when I got the computer I checked the boxes right away to find the re certified marker, nothing.  Called ASUS a couple times finally got somebody that I could understand, but while doing that I went on their website and they have a area for the recall where you can type in your model number to see if your computer is infected.  In nice big red bold letters it said mine was infected and to send it back.  So this is a good computer, but I would not order it from Amazon because you might get an infected one.::rugbytiger2004::2.0::March 30, 2011
R1LOQYQRAB5WDV::nothing but problems republic of gamers laptop::I have had this laptop for 11 months now and thank the lord I purchased the warranty! I loved it when I got it and figured that it would be the best laptop for me for school, this thing had everything I needed and more. Well purchasing this for school you would think that it would have lasted me the first semester right? well wrong, it broke down three weeks before the semester ended,I had to take it to best buy to get fixed because the screen went out, I could plug it in to the Tv and I could see everything but as we all know you cant do all your homework on Tv when others would like the tv also, I do homework every day and night all week long so this wouldn't work! so it took two weeks to fix, back in the clear and working, great! second semester 7 weeks left, I open it turn it on and its a screen with big red letters ERROR, what not again, so I call best buy and they say that's not good bring it in!! ok so I take it in and it wont turn on for them for nothing, so they have to send it away and find out the hard drive and disc drive went out! not even a year and the whole laptop had to basically be replaced. I was going to call customer support and tell them but you cant call you have to do it all online so I cant talk to a real person at all about this ! omg never again I have had to use my old pavilion HP and after five years of no problems I have just had to replace the hard drive that's it!::Gina M.

R2YZFDAX2JIKFS::Are you sure?::I ordered this product on the advice of some friends. Was pretty excited as this was my first new purchase of a notebook PC for a very long time. I am military and deploy pretty frequently, so having something portable that I can watch movies or play games on during downtime was a big motivator to getting this. When it arrived I was pleased with its look and feel... but disappointment set in very shortly after as I realized that the box that would normally have contained a "gaming mouse" was empty and that there was the conspicuous absence of a battery. In my job I am required to check, double check, even triple check my work. A simple QA would have revealed the deficiency. I have found nothing wrong with the product itself, just the sloppy manner of the company.::Paul K. Griffin "USAF TSgt"::3.0::February 9, 2012
RLE307SNSPNB0::Does what I got it for.::This laptop has performed well since I got it. I did have a slight problem with the Asus update utility but other than that I absolutely love it. It runs much cooler than I expected it to and I find that as long as I give it some space in the back it keeps the case cool to the touch.::Lospheris::5.0::June 21, 2011
RHF7ZM9RAH9CU::Poor product quality. Poor customer service::I bought this laptop 5 months ago because a friend gave it great reviews.  At first there was no problem with the computer, but after a month there was a problem with the batteries getting charged.  I've owned many computers in the past and I did all I knew to trouble shoot before getting support.  After a while, I couldn't figure it out, so I went to their website for support.I've been to so many websites for support in the past and thought it would be simple to get some type of customer service.  Boy was I wrong!  I left an email about my problem, but after a couple days, I got tired waiting for a response.  I tried to find an authorized local repair service for my laptop through their website but the page where I was supposed to find an authorized repair service kept on saying that there is no local repair service in the area even if the drop down menu lists at least 3 in my state.So I finally found a phone number to call. It was their 24 hour hotline. I called and was directed to the right extension for laptop repair.  I waited 20 minutes before someone answered the phone. The customer service rep took my number and e-mail, and while I was trying to get him the serial number, I got cut off.  I could hear him but he couldn't hear me.  He apologized that he couldn't hear me and told me to call him back!  He took my number in the beginning of our conversation but he didn't even try to use it to call me back!  Now I had to call back and wait another 20 minutes!  But this time, I just got cut off after 20 minutes!I will never ever ever buy an ASUS again!  This is the worst computer company I have ever dealt with!::Vicente::1.0::August 9, 2011
R1S8GITMAYRURT::Very Cool, aside from touchpad, but worthy.::I got this from another vendor as 'refurbished' for a similar price to amazon's.Screen: huge, glossy, lovely. 1600x900 17.3"Keyboard: interestingly different than most. I don't know the name of what this tech is called. The keys are not butted up against each other but separated, flatter, straight/individual. I like it a lot and I bet it's great for people with big fingers (or poor typing) who might normally hit more than one key. I'm not fond of the arrow key approach (it shrinks up/down to fit together between left/right) but I'll adapt. Has number pad. Bummer though, the numlock key has no light on it nor on the dash so you have no idea if it's on or not. However, the wireless and the 'mute' alt-function buttons have tiny lights as does the left caps lock. Black keys, typical of nearly all laptops nowdays, which since I use my laptop at night in the dark--and use a diff keyboard during my job hours so my brain-patterns are always 'adapting'--drives me crazy. There are little glow in the dark stickers you can get for keyboards to help with this.Dash controls: nothing but power button and touch pad, however, media controls are built into function keys with ALT usage.Touch pad: upside: large, smooth, defined edge. downside: pain in the butt to try and click. Not reasonable for constant use. The alternate 'tap' function so far is incredibly inconsistent. I may need more time/practice. A whole lot of it apparently. That is quite bothersome. Previous reviews I read elsewhere griped about this also. I don't think it's enough to weigh against the merits of the machine which are many--I'd still buy it--but if you don't mind mice (USB) because you mostly use it on a flat surface, you might want to get one. Definitely be sure you go into control panel and mess with your settings. It does have the various options for scroll, zoom in, zoom out, and 3-finger launch which is neat.Ports: all the standards, USB on both sides, multi-option media card reader. Power cord on right side, sticks out the normal amount for laptops (alas). Standard wireless for this day and age. 802.11b/g/n Wireless LANGuts: has a pretty decent processor, 4G RAM (the main reason I got this). If you do advanced gaming or 3D animation you'd want something with a lot more speed and RAM, but I do basic graphics and database work and it's fine for all that. Hard drive is large (640G). Go get 'minitool partition wizard' from cnet (free) and you can split it into a few drive letters for more practical storage/scanning/searching/defragging. (Note: if MPW it won't let you create a partition due to 'no MBR keys', change the non-C 'primary' drives this HP has in place to 'logical' (right-click to do that), then it will.)Peripherals: has mic, internal speakers, webcam. These don't seem special to me but I'm no expert on that. The optical drive is CD/DVD, Blue-Ray and Light-Scribe which is about as much as you can ask.The case is actually lovely, metallic silver with fine lines of engraving. The back of the lid has the round HP logo that is lit up. I guess so either you can tell it's on when it's closed or just because it looks neat.Power: typical AC plus a battery said to be much longer life than normal -- and this despite the huge bright screen. I have not yet had cause to test this to verify it though. 9-Cell 93WHr Lithium-Ion BatteryOS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.Other software: well it's a typical fairly low-end laptop. So you mostly have a bunch of crappy bloatware that wants registration and you should uninstall it and use quality open source based software instead, if clicking a link to uninstall (control panel is where you do that) or install something (once you download an install file to your hard drive) doesn't seem too challenging. Use MS IE to go get free Firefox and Chrome then close IE. Use one of those to go to CNet and get free Avast (an Anti Viral program). Reboot. Uninstall the junk you don't want. Install all the windows updates critically needed. Install the various free software you might want. (I recommend: OpenOffice suite for all the microsoft-like programs, free. 7Zip or WinZip utility. Music Monkey or Jet Audio free jukebox. FileZilla free FTP. When possible stick to download dotcom and cnet dotcom for s/w because they will make sure it is 'clean'.) Textpad is not a free editor but is 'nagware' and is a good customizable colorcode editor if you write code or do much in text. This PC does however come with some decent software free such as two Corel graphic/video programs and Roxio. (I prefer PhotoShop but I can't afford it so I only have it if I steal it. PSP is a good program though. I haven't seen the photo version but the graphics version actually has a photoshop-style interface option.) The microsoft office stuff this machine says it comes with is just to suck you into $. So try OpenOffice which is just as good. Or just use google docs if you're not too demanding and like the idea of being able to get to your stuff from any computer anywhere.Warranty: mine came with 90 days and I bought an extra year, I'm not sure what amazon's options are.I think this is a really good computer for the price. I have had every brand of basic laptop (the <$700 range) there is I think. ALL of them without exception require buying the warranty because the MTBF design of the components crashes shortly after a year. I've had two of nearly everything in fact, one for me and one for my daughter. Dell, Gateway, Toshiba, they at least did service the machines to replace failures in screens, keyboards, power inputs, etc. Acer absolutely sucks, we had two that shortly became paperweights, the disk to allegedly restore or reinstall doesn't work, customer service is on Mars and mostly suggests you pay money to buy the same disk you already have to fix their broken machines. Right now $1200 in Acer laptops are paperweights in my house after hardly any use. (Sorry but on a single mom budget I'm holding a grudge!)This is my first time with HP and I haven't had it very long so I can't compare it in terms of longevity, but in terms of the process/ram/peripherals/screen/price equation, this is one of the best deals around.::Palyne Gaenir::4.0::April 28, 2011
R2SXSBEHGIWS2X::Failed out of the box::Computer failed the first time that I turned it on after opening box. Apparently I can either return it or HP will send me some parts. I am guessing that if I return it, it will only be sent to someone else.....Added - So I decided to keep it and get another hard drive from HP. It took awhile, and many phone calls, but I now have a computer that appears to work.It seems that everyone that orders this gets an inoperable computer So be prepared to call HP service... It seems to be the policy of HP and/or Amazon. Just sell the returned units as "refurb" and hope that the purchaser is willing to call HP service and work through the problems....::Escape Seeker "Escape Seeker"::1.0::August 25, 2011

R3NPSOWOM341K1::Very Nice Laptop::I bought the dv7-4165dx last year from another seller.  I loved it.  Unfortunately, last week it was on my living room floor, and I accidentally stepped on it.  The screen is now non-functional.On the plus side, after a long search, I found the same laptop on Amazon through a trusted seller.  I purchased it this evening.  It's refurbished, of course, but as an Amazon trusted seller, Amazon will warranty the product.At any rate, this is a very good laptop, which is why I searched and purchased an identical laptop.  When it arrives, I will swap the hard drive.  I had the machine customized with programs and operating system, so swapping the drive should work.Reviews of this laptop are largely negative, which I don't understand.  I had this laptop since April 2011, and until I stepped on it, it worked flawlessly.  I particularly liked the large HD screen, the 640 GB HDD, and the HDMI port so I could connect it to my 65" HD TV.HP products are reliable, in my experience.  I have 3 HP laptops (used to have 4, but I stepped on the DV7).  Each of them are refurbished, and each of them work flawlessly.  The laptop I consider my new primary is a coreIIduo 15.1"  I also have a core I3 16 something inch.  I also have a 17.3" AMD dual core HP.  All three work to perfection, even though they are refurbished.I must say that the triple core AMD HP DV7 was my favorite.  Which is why I bought an identical replacement through an Amazon trusted seller.  This laptop out-performs even the core I3.  If you have the opportunity, purchase it.  The triple core processor will blow your mind.::B. Gerdel "Remote Maven"::4.0::September 28, 2012

RI636HRRR82UC::HP Elitebook 2540 P::We replaced HP Windows Vista dv4 5 year old laptop with this HP EliteBook 2540 P Windows 7 unit.  We were NOT interested in Windows 8 at this time, but could not find Windows 7 units from local retailers at the time we were seeking.  (Recently available again because there is still demand - hmmm.)  Purchased this reconditioned laptop and have found it to be much better than expected - very good condition, much better graphics, and small form factor.  We have used the unit for about 1 month and love it!  I have a long history with HP and value their products and performance.  Would buy another reconditioned unit through Amazon if a similar situation arose again!::Eric Janvrin::5.0::February 12, 2014
R14KLZIHT1Q34T::Great Under the Hood, A Little Weak on Peripherals::The first key item of note in reviewing this laptop is that I now own it as a replacement for a slightly cheaper HP with almost identical specs but suffered a massive hardware failure just 31 days after purchase.  Between a solid prior experience with Toshiba and results read in an online study on laptop malfunction rates (where Toshiba came in second only to Asus and ahead of pricer brands like Apple and Sony) I feel far more confident that this machine will last for me.Now onto the specifics of this model....The specs on this fall within the general standard of what I call the level-2 laptop (one price-step ahead of the single core celeron/sempron pure budget machines).The keys are as follows:Athlon II Dual Core 2.2 GHZ with 3 gigs of DDR3 RAM, Mobile Radeon 4250 Graphics, and a 320 Gigabyte hard drive.These are all a good blend of price and functionality that won't be able to run the hottest games on the market (as is the case with any integrated graphics) but handles normal day-to-day along with programs like photoshop or low-res settings of newer games without any problem.The hard drive size is a nice boost from the 250 gig you normally see at this range, though it would probably still behoove anyone with a fair amount of digital media to pick up an external hard drive.Battery life is pretty good as a reflection of it's modest power at about 3 1/2 hours, which should be plenty for most-people's purposed.The one place this machine does lose points however would be peripheral-type hardware.The keyboard is fairly nice with and included 10-key that doesn't cramp the regular keyboard at all.  It also has a memory-card reader built-in that is especially handy for those with phones/cameras/etc. that use sd/microsd/etc.Beyond that however the machine is noticeably lacking in this department with no webcam, only two usb slots, and a smallish oddly textured touchpad.Final Verdict:As long as you are willing to pick up a USB hub this is a great multifunctional machine that is powerful enough for all regular home needs (power gaming and HD video editing aside) while still falling within that budget (i.e. sub-$500) range.As with all of these machines however I recommended you shop around, Amazon's listed price of $488 is about $90 more than I paid, just enough to take it from a great machine for the price to a somewhat average value.::Cassandra Moore::4.0::January 12, 2011
RRG6PQY6XP2KZ::Worhtless.  Save your money.::I bought this machine at Best Buy on 2/1/11, when it was on sale for $[...].  What a fool I was.  On 3/3/11 when I tried to boot up I got screen saying it was attempting to repair itself.  After 12 hours (I'm not kidding), it finally booted to the desktop, but I immediately got error messages saying my applications were having problems.  Frustrated, I took it back to the Best Buy, where one of their "Geek Squad" morons told me it needed to be "restored," and to come back in 4 hours.  When I returned that night, another guy told me the hard disk was defective, and I needed to pay for and procure a "restore disk" from Toshiba.  Even though it's under warranty, Best Buy refused to fix it or refund my money.  Toshiba refuses to provide the "restore disk" unless I pay for it.  This is a fraud, and this "computer" is a piece of worthless junk.I refuse to pay, so I took the computer back from Best Buy.  They demanded I sign a form saying I was satisfied with the repairs!  I refused to sign and took my computer.  Now, it doesn't even boot to the desktop.Don't ever buy from Toshiba OR Best Buy.  They are partners in crime.::KS::1.0::March 6, 2011
RW3GFCXWPNL1M::Great Value Priced Laptop::I was in the market for a new laptop for school that I could pick up for a good price. I ended up narrowing it down to a few models in the $400 - $500 range with a 15.6" display. I ended up getting the Toshiba Satellite L655-5150 at Best Buy for $450, but seriously considered a few others. The Toshiba had 4GB of RAM, the most offered in this price range. The hard drive was only 320GB, but for me that is plenty. I have 2 TB of external drives I use to store videos and archived files on. If hard drive space is more important to you, you can find models offering 500 GB in this price range (The Gateway NV5105u is one I was considering.). The Intel P6200 processor is good, but not necessarily the best offered in the range (The Dell Inspiron I15R-1197MRB comes with a 2.4GHz I-3.). The inclusion of a number pad on the keyboard was a big selling point for me, and the overall aesthetics of the computer are good. Setup was extremely easy and the computer came with very little bloatware installed on the system. I am happy with the Toshiba, but there are several contenders in the "value-priced" laptop category. I think my second choice would have been HP's G62-457DX for $400.::Derek Shockley::4.0::February 13, 2011
R2X70QGZH2XZWX::Toshiba hit the mark!  Easy Set-Up - Fun to Use::I had the opportunity to set up the Best Buy (Torrance, CA) version and the experience was easy -- for a PC -- which is saying a lot from this Apple fiend.  These are the steps this set-up required:  1)  This rig was added to an existing PC only network behind a Lynksys router running a desktop and a Toshiba Satellite L505; 2) I registered w/ Toshiba; 3) Microsoft driven updates totaled 40 which took 3 turns of installing & restarting, but with this speedy machine it was a breeze; and 4) I downloaded and installed individually a menu of free/open source security software including AVG AV, Clam AV, Clam Win, Zone Alarm Firewall, and Panda Cloud AV -- (so much because one of the users is Skype/social networks fiend, and so far no problems, and I like to keep it so).The actual hardware is fabulous -- very responsive keys on the keyboard which look like chiclet design to me.  The boot and re-boot and turn off times are incredible for this price range.  It feels like a well made and well thought out laptop.  The only problem I had was the balance on my Podium Cool Pad laptop stand ( [...] ) -- the laptop is top heavy perhaps due to the 6-cell battery -- and unless balanced precisely it will fall over screen first which is not good for rugged, gaming, dorm room/student use.The owner set up the webcam, Skype and facial recognition features, and they must be very easy and smooth because I have received no Help! requests, and I hear much laughter from their area.::Darice Davis "la33deedah33"::5.0::March 22, 2011

R1ZW2R5W8NN34E::Love it::I bought the toshiba satellite L655-S5150 last February when my old computer broke. I was in a pinch and had to buy a computer that day. I ended up getting this one on sale in the $400 to $500 price range (I can't remember the exact price). I love this laptop. It is by far my favorite computer that I have owned and I have had no problems with it. I like that a numeric pad is also on the key board. My husband ended up getting the same series but a different model than mine and the only difference I notice in his is that his keyboard is backlit. Nice feature, but I wouldn't have paid for it. All in all you can't go wrong with this laptop. I am a full time student and I can keep everything I need on here.::ClassyA::5.0::January 12, 2012
R1UTN164LYDQY9::Nearly Perfect::This is my first PC in almost a decade, so the fact that I even purchased it over a Mac in the first place speaks volumes about this little computer. I've owned it for a little over a month now, so I think it would be fair to say I can assess its tru value at this point. I was impressed by the specs, looks, and size, and for the price (including free xbox with amazon student deal) it really can't be beat in the ultraportable market. I would recommend anyone considering a Sony, Apple, or Samsung ultraportable look into this model as well.I was looking for something this size and weight, with decent specs, but not a blazingly fast, top-of-the line performer. I'm used to the $2000 and up, upgraded Macbook Pros, so I know performance and reliability when I see it, and this thing meets my expectations and more.Pros:Perfect size and shape (same thickness and weight as 2010 Macbook Air)Plenty fast and reliable (though not an i7, or 2011 MBA)Great looks (I actually prefer the flat rounded-smooth shape and color instead of Macbook)Very nice keys trackpadDecent screenDecent WebcamGood software included (Good version of Windows 7 64-bit, Little bloatware)Cons:Keyboard not backlit (I still look at my keys sometimes, so typing in dark is hard)No SD card slot (Not a dealbreaker obvuiously, but would have been nice)Battery underwhelming (2.5 to 4 hours isn't bad, but competitors are getting 9 from a charge)Unless you are a superuser, and you need gaming on the go, or video and music editing, this will be more than enough for you. If you want to be doing very processor intensive tasks, then ultraportable probably isn't your class anyway.::Patrick M. "Patrick M."::4.0::July 25, 2011
RBKWVJ7W2T2RK::Light and good look, but a bit too slow::Pro: Love the design, and the screen is amazing. Very light.Con: Only two USB, intergrated battery - hope it will not die on me soon, no SD card slot, a bit slow in time even with a i5 processor::Chi Li::4.0::April 6, 2011
R18ZQSI1S6NWHP::Great lightweight notebook BUT!!!::got the Orange U260 .... 1st impression is that it is very lightweight, handy and the screen is very good. Speed is not exceptional but is adequate for its class. the keyboard felt really good and the system is really queit. I looked at the specs and was really good.Here are the cons:When I bought the system I read it could go up to 8gb! but the system I have only can stay at 4gb! it suppose to have 2 slots of memory! but after calling Lenova I found out that not all models have that! So! its a big Minus to me when I try to upgrade the memory .Access to HD and memory is really difficult. since it is kind of a self contain unit and not able to change things out.3rd issue is the battery cannot be easily change !have to pretty much strip the unit to get to it! if you do decide to have a spare! since the battery life on this unit is not impressive! rated at 4hr! but I am getting more like 3 hr max!Overall! was a bit dissapointed with some of these items I mentioned! other than that! I loaded up Office 2007, Adobe Photoshop CS5, and even run some of my game well.DaveC::Tiong Guan Chng::3.0::September 19, 2011
RGVBMU6MDHB8T::Poor product and poor repair service::I purchased this laptop 5 months ago. I loved the color and thinness of the laptop. At 33 days old, it would not start up at all and had to be sent in for repair. It was returned not properly functioning, so it had to be sent back. Now 4 months after that the hard drive has to be replaced again. I have purchased many brands of laptops and have never had any problems within the first 2 years. This laptop is awful and the customer service is worse. Please reconsider making this purchase. I had heard good things about Lenovo products, but I regret buying this laptop. I am already in the market for a new computer 5 months after my purchase because this product is too unreliable for a law student, and I am only certain of one thing my new laptop will not be a Lenovo.::Kelly::1.0::December 19, 2011
R1PCI2XBL23NVC::Unbelieveable...::I needed a light but large screen laptop for travel. Well this worked out. I do web development with PHP, Dreaamweave, MS Asp.Net and Flash / Flex. I run MySQl and several machine intense software. Never an issue.Works great, fast, and easy to carry. I plan to buy another for my trip overseas. Wouldn't be without it...::L. Holman::5.0::September 25, 2011
R1RNX2DX3090M4::A Notebook done right.::As a longtime Apple PowerBook user(there are currently four in the house going back to 1998), the look, feel and build quality of this Lenovo is just right.  In fact, I prefer many of it's qualities to the more current MacBooks.  For one, the use of a matte screen is extremely welcome. Secondly, this notebook has superb ergonomics and a warm, tactile quality that is indeed very book-like - from the exterior metal covers and their soft, grippable texture to the leather-like palm-rest and silky smooth trackpad.  The clever use of all these various materials and treatments to enhance the user experience is quite well done and the size and weight seem ideal.  There is certainly an Apple-like attention to detail but I think the actual feel and look of this notebook is the polar opposite to that of current Mac's, which can come off as cold and sterile. Anyway, there are a few con's, as well as a few things that could have been executed just a little bit better.  First up, the battery life is only about 3 hours.  Combine the short battery life with the use of a standard HD (instead of a SSD) and I have to wonder just how much more battery life could have been achieved had Lenovo used a SSD.  I also think the screen, while nice, could have been a little better with regard to viewing angle.  For instance, it's nowhere near the quality of my ancient Powerbook G4 and it's Samsung-made screen, though, in fairness, no current Apple screen - matte or glossy - is that good either.  The other cons come with the thin and light aspect I suppose.  First, there are limited ports and there is no card reader.  Secondly, upgrading this Notebook with, for instance, an SSD drive, or replacing the internal battery will require disassembly of the bottom half of the laptop. Overall, though, I believe this is one very nice notebook.::Tariq Gibran Hamid::4.0::March 5, 2011

R2O32YD5IGJVM0::Piece of Junk with a Worthless Warranty::A month after I bought this computer, the hard drive failed. When I sent it in for warranty repair, they kept it for 3 weeks (not including shipping time) before shipping it back and telling me that they couldn't replace the hard drive because I "installed Linux on it." This was absolutely not the problem, as I completely wiped the hard drive before sending it to them, and it still failed almost instantly using the manufacturer's diagnostic utility. Rather than spend the effort to fight them on it and spend another month without a computer, I just bought a replacement drive and installed it myself. This fixed my problem, but also voided the warranty (big mistake). I should note that this was not Lenovo directly, but rather the company they contracted to do warranty repair, but still.After 6 months, the display failed. It would still output video, but the output was duplicated across the screen at lower resolution, making it completely unusable. Since I usually use an external monitor, I was annoyed by this, but not enough to pay to replace it. At 7 months it stopped turning on completely. Warranty repair was refused, and I ended up buying a new computer. They offered to repair it for less than the cost of the replacement, but I was not about to give them another penny for this piece of crap.So I would not recommend this computer at all. It's a piece of junk that breaks very quickly, and they will weasel their way out of warranty repairs with bs excuses and by making the process so time consuming and difficult that you will give up.::andrewms::1.0::April 28, 2012
R2YC64922P6OS3::Graphics card died after two months of light use.::I usually disdain writing reviews in general, but I am compelled to do so on this one. This computer is a piece of junk, period! The video card failed on me after two months of just light use from doing basic research online. I called Lenovo and it turned out that Lenovo contracted their services to another company. If you want to cry about their products, good luck on that one. I had to purchase a new netbook and will send out this piece of junk back to Lenovo for repair. The rep told me that a tech will take a look at the laptop to determine if it is a genuinely defect or due to my fault. Wow! I was speechless and not to mention pissed-off. Of course, the rep wasn't a Lenovo's employee per se so I just didn't want to take my frustrations out on the poor guy who works oversea. Take note of this Lenovo! I will continue to write a distasteful review if my laptop is not going to be repaired right. Will be back for a follow-up review.Tony::A.D::1.0::November 11, 2011
R1BKB1RKIP9T6J::Work horse::I had this for quite a wile and it is working like new.Love the 1 touch recovery botton.... Best thing ever...A little outdated on connection variaty.... (NO USB3, only 2 regular USB,.....)::M. Veith "bäcker"::5.0::October 8, 2013
RJGA6H91BFK55::Great Computer... but I returned it.::My situation may be a little different. The last PC I purchased was a Dell back in '03. Since then I have used nothing but Macs at home and at work. I bought this nice little notebook today. The Lenovo looked perfect. The perfect screen size for me, perfect weight, the keyboard was fantastic and really, it's just a well manufactured PC laptop. i was very happy with my purchase.So I charged the puppy up and started my computing. My first foray into the world of Windows in so many years was underwhelming. I found the OS to be confusing and slow. For example, to update Windows, I had to go to the Start Menu>Accessories>Windows Update> and then click "Update Windows". A really long process compared with Apple>System Update. Another example is the icons when Alt+Tab (switching between programs). The icons on Windows 7 are actual real-time representations of the programs, and not the icons of the programs like in OSX. Extremely confusing when switching programs.It's not fair for me to give this computer less of a rating because of it's operating system. After all, millions of people use Windows 7 and are just fine with it. But if you are a Mac user who is looking for a comparable version of the MacBook Air or MacBook, this might be a good choice if it weren't for the OS and a couple of other things.A note about the hardware, it is BEAUTIFUL. The textured, almost leather-like skin is amazing to touch, the keyboard is perfectly in place, the unit is perfectly constructed, solid and appears to be of fantastic quality. A truly amazingly designed unit. My only peeves about the actual computer is the trackpad and the battery life.The trackpad suffers from not being Mac-like. It is small and has no gestural functions, which is unacceptable for me. The battery only gave me 2.2 hours at the default settings and a full charge. Know that there is NO optical drive and NO removable battery. So you'll be taking this thing in for a battery change.All-in-all, if you like Windows 7, and like your computer to be solid and small, this is your laptop.So sadly, after 2 hours, I am returning my Lenovo. I'll be getting a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro upon return.::budakhan::4.0::September 3, 2011
R2OOJ7MAN395KY::A competent laptop with a few shortcomings.::Previous to this Toshiba C655-S5132 laptop I owned an Acer Aspire One 8.9 inch netbook. The most impressive feature of the Toshiba is the 15.6 inch screen, which is a delight to view. It's so easy to read and is sharp and bright that photos pop out of the page. This is a user friendly computer and handsome at that. It is very quiet and doesn't heat up on you. The surfaces are textured so fingerprints aren't an issue. The keyboard is full size, unlike my Acer, so it's really easy and comfortable to type on. The wireless is very powerful and can pull in signals without an adapter. You can piggyback signals without the need of a booster antenna. Internet access is relatively fast and reliable. The six cell battery is long lasting, almost four hours. The audio speakers sound a heck better than what I've been accustomed, although a pair of add-ons are necessary to give you quality music reproduction. The Windows Seven software is very basic and simpler than the Microsoft XP program. It is streamlined and more intuitive, but once you get the hang of it you can accomplish whatever it is you need to do.  The 3GB memory drive is very ample with plenty of space to spare for your files, photos and music downloads.  There are a couple of items that could be improved, however.  The Toshiba features only two USB ports situated on the left side. Three would have been better (with one on the right), 'cause I don't like the fact I have to stretch the mouse wire to my right side (I'm right handed, wouldn't matter if you're a lefty). The mouse by the way is an accessory- it isn't included in the purchase price. Secondly, a webcam would have been a nice addition. But overall, I am enjoying this laptop. It has no technical issues and the unit appears to be dependable. For the money I feel it's a good buy and superior to the Acer netbook.::DB Edwards "Tally Ho!"::4.0::April 20, 2011
R3HH0UFDYHZUVG::Very happy with the Toshiba Satellite C655-S132::I replaced a four year old Compact which just went belly-up one morning upon startup. Fortunately I had done a complete back-up, on an external drive, the night before. (Hard to believe I got that lucky and I definitely recommend doing so frequently on an external drive it saved me many headaches.)I really like the keyboard which is standard size for a laptop and has a separate numeric pad which I use frequently. The screen is very bright, but not glaring and so far I have no complaints. Yes, I too would prefer to have another usb port on the right side, but since I use a wireless mouse I have no problem with the cord being stretched. If I need more usb ports, I can always purchase a Black 4-Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub from Amazon they are on sale today for $2.95 regularly $19.99. Black 4-Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub I'm very happy with mine and will be telling my sister to get the same one, so you know I must really like it!::lizzp91105::4.0::May 25, 2011
RYNKTA8RG5VHK::Choose something else.::I've had this laptop for about 3 months. Out of those 3 months, Ive only used it a handful of times to check email. The screen just blacked out and it's a known issue. So you can choose to buy this one because of the price and the cool commercials, like I did, or spend a tad more and have a reliable laptop. I would take mine back but I threw it across a parking lot. Toshiba has good products but they dropped the ball on this one. The resolution sucks, too.::Mikal::1.0::December 6, 2011
R2FJFQETY1DJ0::Partially functional computer::Purchased this several months ago. I recently discovered that one of the USB ports and the Ethernet connector do not function.

R1B3VK1SMH6XZO::Great Laptop::This laptop really is worth the price my older sister had this laptop for 4 years before giving it to my mom who has had it for 2 years.

Was dropped once by me and no visible damage done to the screen or anything else.::Lglizete::4.0::June 2, 2011
R266RSTJ8CTHYC::Toshiba disappoints, again.::This is the 2nd Toshiba laptop I have purchased over the past 3 years.  My first one's hard drive crashed after being dropped only about a foot onto soft carpeting.  Since it was 2 years old at the time, I did not make a fuss about it.Since I was used to the Toshiba layout and thought that they were decent products, I decided to give them another chance.  What a mistake.  I purchased this model from Best Buy just 8 months ago and the screen is no longer functional.  Best Buy accused me of dropping it - which DID NOT happen.  So then I contacted Toshiba, hoping that they would make good on their 1 year warranty.  I was told that their warranty does not cover the screen.  What a joke of a laptop and of a company.  The Toshiba representative made the mistake of comparing their warranty to a car's manufacturer's warranty.  My profession is in the car business and I frankly told the representative that it was a horrible comparison because new car warranties would cover almost anything wrong with the car during the warranty period - UNLIKE Toshiba.  TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR TOSHIBA.  STAY AWAY!!!::Mike Maria::1.0::January 3, 2012
R323GSMSKZ3G0I::Always Been Satisfied::I didn't purchase this product but won it from the local medical center in a Facebook fan contest. Even though I didn't buy it, I have never been more happy with a laptop! Looking at buying one for my husband. We previously owned two HP laptops and they didn't even make it a year before they started having problems. It has always done everything I've needed it to do. Would definitely buy another Toshiba product!::AshCunn::5.0::August 4, 2013
R2FGAMK9UZPZTT::DVD drive broke after 3 months::The DVD-RW on this computer died 3 months after we bought the computer, after only a handful of uses. It just made a noise and then would not open, let alone do anything else. The Toshiba Warranty people were terrible -- their only solution was for us to backup our laptop and mail it to them and then 5 weeks later, maybe we'd get it back fixed or maybe a whole different computer (a reconditioned one), at their discretion. What this really meant was that we'd have to wipe the computer clean to avoid any identity theft and then reinstall it all again later. They refused to send us a replacement drive (that we or a local company could install for us), or let us take it to a local place to fix. Consequently, since we couldn't be without a computer that long and really didn't have time to deal with wiping the computer and re-installing everyting, we were out $60 to have a local company fix it for us. Best Buy, where we bought it, was also NO help. So much for the Geek Squad -- more like a big Zero Help Squad. All they offered was to help us mail it to Toshiba. Also, FYI, if you're not looking at this in person or out of the box before you buy it, the case and the keys on this model look cheap and flimsy.::Chilly Willy::1.0::September 10, 2011
R18LYQB3QILJO8::Do not buy this::Do not buy this product.  I have had my Toshiba for only two months.  The LCD screen cracked.  I did nothing to the screen to make it crack.  I was told by Toshiba that it was not covered by the warranty.  The cost to replace the LCD screen is anywhere from $175- $400.  I paid $374.00 at Best Buy for this computer. I had a Dell Inspiron 2200 for six years. I have never had a problem with Dell fixing anything on the computer.  My screen never cracked.  I also had a Gateway desktop for many years with hardly any problems, and Gateway always fixed whatever was wrong.I bought a new computer because the backlight to my Dell was going out and I thought getting a new computer would be more cost effective because it would be brand new.  I was wrong.  I guess you get what you pay for.::Carol S. Tavalin::1.0::May 16, 2011

RGFK7KLO1W41B::Love it!::I don't know too terribly much about computers, but I haven't had any problems with mine yet. I LOVE that it has a number pad on the side, and the keyboard is very easy to type on. The track pad is textured, which I really like. The webcam is quite nice, and has good resolution.The only downside that I have found is that the track pad is off center, so sometimes my hand bumps into it while I'm typing, and it messes me up. But honestly, it is a small price to pay for all of the features that I like about it.::Shelby::5.0::August 26, 2011
R1KNG2TC867CAL::Great laptop for basic computing::I purchased this laptop from CircuitCity.com for $499 -- it is an excellent value for the specs, and it had everything I was looking for in a laptop.  I wanted it to be easy to travel with, have a webcam to Skype with my family when I travel for work, and have enough RAM and harddrive space to run multiple programs and save basic documents for home and work computing.  I like Windows 7 and the Sony Viao options so far.  The one surprise was it's not just white -- the wristrest area is glittery which makes it look rather girly, and that isn't really shown in the photos or descriptions online.  I'm just glad I bought it for me and not my husband otherwise it would have been getting returned.::Jennifer Ziegler::5.0::May 4, 2011

R16GIAVNWAA2HW::Good tech for the price, but some problems here.::I've had this laptop for about a week now and am very satisfied with the processor speed and screen resolution.  I remain happy with the price (I got it on a Lightning Deal for $498).  However, the keyboard is still hard to get used to because the backslash key is too close to the left shift and the forward slash key is too close to the Enter key.  Also, the keyboard is quite a bit undersensitive so I have to type more forcefully or else some keystrokes don't register.One problem with this laptop is the battery, which plugs in at a perpendicular angle and elevates the back end of the laptop.  Although this provides a nice tilt toward me and allows for air to flow under and cool the machine, it makes for awkward storage in my briefcase and I have already accidentally dislodged the battery twice when pulling the machine out of my briefcase.  I am concerned that this will lead to undue wear and tear on the battery port in the future.EDIT:  I have had this laptop for 6 months now and remain happy with its performance.  After multiple efforts to address the "undersensitive keyboard" problem without resolution, I finally determined that it was due to interference from the touchpad.  Since I was using a bluetooth mouse anyway, I simply disabled the touchpad and the keyboard issue went away.  So, I am upgrading my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I still do not like the angle of the battery, as it tilts the computer in a way that causes my palms to hit the touchpad, and it also makes the computer a tight fit in my slim computer bag.  However, I have only accidentally pulled the battery off the machine 4-5 times, which is less than I thought I would when I first got the laptop (but still more than I would like).  I remain satisfied with the processor and screen for the price.::Austin.Boomerang::4.0::November 25, 2013

Good wifi range.size makes the laptop very easy to transportCONS:Intel Atom CPU is not a Positive or a negative,its smooth and steady, fair for the price, but not FAST by any means.keyboard could have been layed out a little better. feels cramped.Afterall what do you expect for a budget laptop with 1GB of ramand a single core intel atom cpu @ 1.6ghz?????????Overall, i give this laptop 3 stars or a 7.5 out of 10.Its upto Par with other laptops in this class.Its Not the Worst, but its not the greatestI would recommend the laptop to a friend who was lookingfor a laptop on a budget of under $160.00Thanks for reading hope this was helpful.

R329HMQDH622QC::Not bad for a simple work laptop::As a simple laptop to carry around to work and not worry about breaking it due to its low cost this one isn't bad to have. I'd rather break this every time over any of my other more expensive laptops. With that said it does have built in wifi which can be helpful. As the other reviewer said it has a rather low processor. It doesn't offer much storage but then again there is a reason why they are cheap. This laptop is what i would consider for a work laptop that just needs simple internet connectivity and maybe a word program. This also wouldn't be a bad choice as a starter laptop for some kids, since it is cheap and kids usually destroy things.Overall it is OK it has many cons and a few pros. It will work as a beater laptop for work or kids. However as a personal laptop it is less than desirable. As work laptop for someone who does extensive work on computers you'll be frustrated with the simplicity and overall quality of this laptop. However as a work laptop for those whom need only a simple internet connection and word document this one will get the job done...just barely though.::RedConOne::3.0::November 19, 2012
R3HGE0G2MT6SCH::Bargain Workhorse::I bought this laptop directly from dell Financial Services auction on ebay. I did not even know that they have it here on Amazon Marketplace too. Even though the description said manufacturer refurbished the laptop I received looked like new. It came with power adapter and a Dell Windows XP Reinstallation CD and built in Intel PROSet Wireless Card. Absolutely no bloatware is included.Now this may not be a top of the line machine but it is pretty adequate for home and school or even Small Home Office use. The neat part is that once you boot up the machine for the first time it would automatically install Windows XP after going through some preliminary steps. It even gives you option to enter setup and configure things but you are better off leaving the machine alone to do its thing and install windows XP or whichever operating system it is bundled with unless you're techie. Once windows finishes installation you can pretty much install anything you want. I have so far installed Open Office, MS Office 2003, Firefox, Chrome, Avast Anti Virus, Trusteer Rapport security Software and many other productivity softwares and the machine boots up and runs smoothly.It does not come with webcam so I installed Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 and Microsoft Lifecam Cinema and either camera runs smoothly even on HD modes. I use Lifecam Cinema more often because it's stand is perfect fit for D630 bezel as opposed to the Quickcam Pro 9000's stand which tend to wobble.I will advise you buy this laptop directly from Dell either here on Amazon Marketplace or on ebay where it is listed under Dell_Financial_Services. You will likely receive a laptop that will be like new but more importantly you will get 30 days warranty.This laptop is of right price, size and specs: 14" bright LCD, 2GB Ram, 80GB harddisk space and 2GHZ Intel Dual Core processor that is more than adequate for most home, school and or Small Home Office use. It is sturdy and sleek looking too.There is one thing that Dell scrimped on here: the tiny single speaker that is barely audible! I use an external Frisby USB laptop Speakers. I also use headphone when I am on the road. It is worthy to note that this tiny speaker belies a powerful sound card that only becomes apparent when you put on a headphone.NB: Don't forget to switch on the wireless radio or you will not be able to use the wifi connection. The switch is on same side and next to the headphone jack. It is switched off by default. Once you switch it on it will detect a bunch of wifi hot spots including yours, if any. Select your SSID from the displayed options and enter your router's WEP Key and you will be good to go. I have at&t; 2WIRE Wireless Gateway and the WEP Key is the ten digit number directly below the serial number located on the side or bottom of the router depending on whether it is standing vertically or lying on it's side. The built in wireless card is powerful. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who may be on budget but not willing to compromise on quality and performance.::Amazon Customer::4.0::May 26, 2011
R27CIE3FIWLFNK::Caution::I got this laptop in a timely manner and it appears to be in excellent shape.  However, when I had problems and called Dell tech support, they told me that the laptop owner had not transferred the laptop to me.  Thus, I am unable to get help!  I have contacted the seller requesting assistance with this, but have not heard back.  When buying a laptop, be sure you get the ownership transferred to you.::Teddi Bear::3.0::September 29, 2011
R35X92KGT3OI6O::First one great!  Second one not so great.....::I bought two of these.  The first one was in excellent condition, really impressive for a "refurb".  So when hubby murdered his laptop by spilling a drink into it, I thought this D630 would be the perfect replacement for him.  When it arrived, we were both a bit disappointed.  It functions correctly but has a loose lid/screen that can wobble and some sticking keys and generally looks quite used.  He's satisfied enough to keep it, partly because he doesn't want to be without one for any length of time, and partly because we've had positive experiences with off-lease Dells in the past even if they have a wart or two.My personal disappointment was that after receiving the first one, I expected the same level of quality from the second one because at that time, it was sold by Amazon -- not a marketplace refurb seller where you can never be sure of what you'll get until you open the box.::V::4.0::July 26, 2011
R1MKMLTKJACB8G::Buy the service contract with this item::If you buy one of these refurbished computers be sure to buy the warranty. The one I purchased only lasted 46 days which is 16 days past the 30 day return period. It quit working and it needs new screen ($600.00) and new battery. I didn't notice that you could buy a warranty when I bought it so I just wasted $300.00. Be sure you buy the warranty!::Harold K. Hahn::1.0::November 8, 2011
R1VPA6QNW84WEL::Fantastic Little Computer!::I purchased one of these laptops from Link-Tronics Memory through Amazon, to replace a laptop my grandmother had that she lost in a wildfire in Texas.  She loved it! But more importantly, she took it to her computer guy and he said it was an excellent computer - better than any refurbished computer he sold.Then I purchased one for my sister who has wanted a laptop for a while.Finally I purchased one for my teenage son for Christmas.What I was thrilled about these little laptops is that they came loaded and tweaked almost exactly how I would done. In all honesty, I was prepared with my OS disc and drivers and programs to reformat, but there was no need to do so.The performance of these laptops has far superseded an XPS gaming laptop that was given to me a couple years ago. It's an old model, but that should still say something about the Dell Latitude D630.It's slim and has a nice profile to it, easy to carry with you if you don't have a case.I have refurbished several of our old computers over the years so my advice to those that have had a bad experience with this laptop is that they *are* refurbished. When companies refurbish a computer, they go through and test to see what needs replaced and they replace it or fix it, wipe the drive (or stick a new one in), maybe clean it up a bit, and you have a refurbished computer. Considering the age of the model, there are surely things that will wear out or break much sooner than you would expect from a brand new computer. The lids, keyboards, mouse buttons, and whatnot are guaranteed to have some wear and scratches, it may or may not arrive looking sparkly and new.  Buying refurbished most likely means that calling the manufacturer will do no good for support, as it is no longer under their warranty. Purchasing a refurbished, one should expect these things and set their expectations accordingly. It is not a brand new computer.All in all, the Dell Latitude D630 is a nice little working computer. It makes a perfect gift for kids, or anyone that just wants a decent laptop, but not want to spend a fortune.  The price is good too - I've looked for months for something and found this to be the best bargain.I would definitely recommend this laptop!::Vanessa::5.0::December 1, 2011
R2LWM99G8OIKQD::Amazing::I,ve been a pc tech for 20 years and my dell d630 is awsome the keyboard is a little worn but got one off of amazon for 18 dollars also i added 4gb of ram. Had to get a new harddrive i had the warranty but the sent me a new one quicly with no fuse or trouble my only regret is paying double from tigerdirect instead of buying from amazon i know next time.::Work Horse::5.0::February 7, 2012
R2D3XQJE5KK6MY::Just buy a new one::I purchased a refurbished Dell Latitude D630, paying about as much as a low end brand new laptop.  My reason for getting a refurbished computer is because I wanted to continue to use Windows XP and this was a way to get a "new" computer that still used XP.  I also wanted to still be able to use my old programs and hardware that are still compatible with XP.  I refuse to use Vista, and Windows 7 is marginal but I don't like it and it's not compatible with a few of my programs.  Out of the box it worked perfectly.  Unfortunately it only worked perfectly for about a month.  Now I can see why it was sent back to Dell.  It will randomly crash and shut down, and now that I have owned it for several months, it's too late to return it to Amazon.  Don't bother with a refurbished computer.  Just go get a new one with a full warranty.  If it's been refurbished, there's a reason that someone else sent it back.::Trapper::1.0::May 25, 2012
R1J6JODAXKS20W::Well worth the price::This computer is a great novice computer, it has all the necessary features of an entry level PC, without the junk that is usually installed. The RAM installed is adaquate, however an additional megabyte makes this PC work much better. This PC has no media slots, stereo speakers, web camera, or microphone, each of which can be purchased later. For e-mail, word processing, internet browsing, or spreadsheet calculations, this is much better than a net-book.::Ward Scott Watson::4.0::January 17, 2012

R2KSM48R6ZQ2H::Plenty of Memory and Speed::I bought this "refurbished," which is to say, with Windows XP already up and running. Not quite sure that's a true refurb, but who cares. I never completely trust inherited computers, so I booted the included re-installation disc, reformatted the drive, and hours and hours later of installing the drivers specific to this hardware, I had me one sweet ride! (Note: never buy an XP with less than 2GB of mem, and always demand an installation disc. I used DriverUpdate to download most of the drivers, but still needed to manually track down drivers for the VGA card and the TouchPad/Stick.)::Chris::4.0::March 26, 2013

R2BK1C91UTG915::Excellent conditions, excellent time, but...::The laptop, refurbished, came with excellent conditions, but just one little but important detail....its hard drive is only 60G, not 80G, as mentioned in the promo.I would rate it as 5, but, the hard disk only has 40G free, given that the Vista takes that space, I almost would have to buy a new disk, make a backup, and you know, a mess.::Yrving Rivas "Yrving"::3.0::December 18, 2012
R1EHDHDHD045C4::Excellent Product and Service::We bought the Dell Latitude D630 for school work for our youngest. The price was very reasonable and the laptop was in great condition. Unfortunately, the laptop had problems connecting to our wifi, which apparently was the result of a bad wireless card. Contacted  Jeremy's Laptops, and he made good on his sale. He sent a replacement right a way and the replacement works just fine. Good product and speedy customer service. Definitely deserves the five stars.::Carmen::5.0::November 5, 2012
R36YF950DVSQSP::Excellent, but your mileage may vary...::I bought my first refurbished laptop about 5-6 years ago because it was inexpensive and I typically use it on trips so if it gets stolen I wouldn't lose a new laptop. But I had a very good experience with it so I've continued to buy refurbished ones for other members of my family when I see good ones at a good price.And this Dell D630 is the case. The condition of my D630 is very good. The keyboard looks new and there's no dust on it. There are some scratches on the bottom of the case but I can live with that. Every refurbished computer will be different though so you mileage will vary. It really depends on how the last corporate users used it. If it's a low usage computer, then you've got a good deal.Function: It's got a Core2Duo processor, which is newer than the Pentiums but older than the new iCores. It still has 2 CPU's in it. I upgraded mine to 4GB RAM (one of the cheapest and best way to upgrade your laptop) and the OS to Windows7 64-bit. RAM is so cheap nowadays I automatically upgrade all of my computers to the max, but do it yourself as it's often cheaper than having the vendor do it. Even with Windows7, this runs very fast. I use this mainly for surfing, but even with multiple browsers and multiple tabs running, this thing is fast.Right now, I'm very satisfied with it, especially at the refurbished price.If you can get a good price, go for it. If something is really worn out or needs replacing sometimes a complaint to the vendors may solve your problem, but if they won't, getting replacement parts is pretty cheap too, you can find replacements all over the internet. So if you're like me, want a low priced laptop that you travel a lot with get one of these.::John B. Goode "JBG"::5.0::October 26, 2012

R2WNQIZ5LE4D3I::Great product, great service, great company::The laptop arrived very quickly and it looked and performed just like a new laptop!  I was very impressed with how the laptop looked and how well it performed! Even more impressive was that I had a question regarding the laptop's wireless connection and their customer service person was extremely helpful, professional, and customer service oriented.  Turned out it was this specific laptop's on/off wireless switch that needed to be manually turned back on.  I will definitely recommend Tampa Laptops to all my friends and relatives.::Larry Wills::5.0::January 11, 2012

I would recommend this seller and product again, in fact 2 of my other kids are wanting to buy from them....::Lori M from MO::5.0::December 10, 2011

R2C1713PU40CYY::How much does a key cost?::I have purchased several used laptops over the past few years, all totaling in cost less than what a new one would cost. I've had very good luck with two prior to this one. You get a few surprises, such as my spell check was in French, and I'm not French. But, for the most part, I've been very happy. I'm disabled, so I stay on the computer all day, every day. I have 3 lap dogs that stay on me too. They had knocked a couple of my keys off of the keyboard with their nails, and I had a couple of hints that the motherboard might be getting ready to die, so time to replace it. I won't by a new one because I hate the newer operating system they come with. So I ordered another used one. It arrived and seems to be fine, but the letters are worn on several of the keys. It's an issue with me because I'm not a typest, and have to visually see what I'm typing. Really? How much could it have possibly cost to replace a few keys? Oh, when you start your Windows, you have to put the product key numbers in.........it's not on the copy of the CD they send you, but on a microscopic stamp taped to the bottom of the computer. You have to get a magnifying glass, turn the computer upside-down, write the number down, and go from there. Think they could have stuck it on the CD for convience?::teapot92::4.0::June 30, 2012
R11TD25WIFTK2::not refurbished::I had a old Dell with a CD drive instead of a DVD drive. I never at any point said I will never buy another Dell. When I wanted a new desktop I bought a Dell. It had no volumn to it which I figure was due to it being from the bottom of the price range and I do not like Windows 7 which is not Dells fault. I had this for several months and never said I will never buy another Dell. I decided I wanted a laptop with wireless internet as I did not have the money to get internet service and with Windows XP. I read the reviews and when I saw that it was a Dell referbished by Dell, I bought one. I will never buy another Dell. The left mouse button constantly clicks by itself. I had to reverse the buttons to be able to use it at all. Even then it causes a lot of problems when I am writing e-mails and other things. When I turn it on The Windows logo comes up and after a while the screen goes grey. Half the time the computer continues normally, but about half the time the computer just sits there and grinds. I have to hold the button down until it goes off. I am on a fixed income which it why I buy low priced computers. It hurts to have to put money aside to repair a refurished computer. Some people trade in their computers because they need or want something new. Others trade in their computers because something is about to break and they do not want to have to get it fixed. You buy these machine it is a crap shoot as to what you are going to get. Dell does not refurbish them, they just reinstall the old software and they do not care it you are ripped off by them.::zxjq::2.0::November 5, 2011

R1PWWIUOKPX8H6::Refurbished Dell Latitude D630::I purchased this laptop to give myself something to tinker with while recovering from surgery.  The system has been working perfectly for the last 2 months and is probably the best bang for the buck for a laptop refurb.The versitility of this machine allows for a second battery or hard drive to be installed in the module bay.  I purchased a used docking station which also includes a bay where the battery can be charged or the HD or DVD-ROM module can be used.It is always a roll of the dice when you buy refurbed or used computers and parts and sometimes you will get a defective unit but I am very happy with this purchase.::J.

The only obvious sign of wear was on the bottom side. I loaded a 3d CAD program onto it and it performs great and runs cool. That is exactly why I love a laptop with XP. Also included was a dvd-rw drive and all for the lowest price on the net...  I have also received a monitor stand and d-port replicator from amazon and everything works fine. I will be buying refurbished from now on as new computers simply aren't worth the money.::SirTopp'mHat::5.0::March 9, 2012

RUSPP3ARUI4FM::Just a fantastic piece of equipment.::The headlines pretty much said how I felt about it. You know that you have something which you value when you are thinking about getting a similar one as a spare-not because you feel the one in your hands it unreliable-because you know that accidents do happen, and you would hate to be without something this efficient for an extended period of time. I purchased one two years ago at what I considered to be a good price, and I just got another one because to me the price was sooo right. They are both performing superbly.One word of caution though: In buying computers-new or old, but especially old, yopu want to try and make sure that you know exactly what you are getting for your money. I wish that amazon would require of their vendors that they post more complete descriptions when it comes to something like a computer, which carries a big price tag and does include many details and components/parts. However, since they don't, make it a point to contact the potential vendor by email with some direct questions before making a purchase. Just because the general product description says one thing does not guarantee that it applies to the one you are buying. Case in point: my second laptop came with a 60GB harddrive, even though in the general description for the Dell 630 laptop, it says an 80GB harddrive. This is still fine by me, because 60 GB from my point of view and my needs, is still substantial, and the device does include all of the features which prompted me to make the purchase in the first place. What I am saying is this: it is usually better to know exactly what you are getting into beforehand.::JFF::5.0::December 24, 2013
R2QSI1K7PR05CK::Best computer ever::I am a computer repair and sales specialist and this is my go to computer for 95% of my clients. It is very affordable and powerful enough for the majority of users. easily upgraded to as much ram as you could ever really need in a personal computer. It is also a great business computer compatible with ant 21st century Windows operating system. Including Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. Considering the age of the computer the Dell Latitude D630 has stood out as one of the best computers I have ever worked with. Definitely buy this computer!::Dylan::5.0::December 23, 2013

R1G1YDR9TKXV4G::For my purposes it works great!::(If I have a problem I will update this review at that time, but suspect I will not.)  All I wanted is something to use offline, a graphics art program.  I do not want to be online with this laptop - I use a desktop for that - because I don't want to worry about viruses or hackers etc.  messing with my art projects.  Therefore I can't comment on how it works online.The program, Painter X  (X stands for 10, not X rated!), works just as fast and well as it does on my brand new Dell laptop. Ditto Windows XP.  I don't know about the battery since I plan to pretty much leave it in the same spot and keep it plugged in.  Everything looks virtually new.  Also, the person at Incomputer was very swift to answer my little Qs and help me out regarding a problem with the Painter (easily resolved since he knew what to do) Program.  Thanks Incomputer!::Trish "Lorica Lady"::5.0::December 11, 2013
R2H12KFNK8XHTT::This is great for a first laptop.::I got a refurbished Dell D630 "B Unit":- 2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo- 4GB RAM- 80 GB Hard Drive- CD/DVD-RW- Official Windows 7 Professional License with recovery disc- Battery & AC adapter (power supply) included- 120 Day Limited Warranty- Refurbished by a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You can't beat the price. The performance is up to par. The only fault is the hinge for the screen isn't very sturdy. Although that is probably the case with most laptops on the market. I would not recommend this for neglectful children; because as I said before the hinges are not very sturdy. Without the AC adapter I get about 15mb/s for file transfer/ With the AC adapter I get about 30mb/s for file transfer.::quantumtraveler::4.0::November 27, 2013

R3KIXA7GSGRCZP::I work overseas in a developing country and everyone wants a computer.::The problem is they can not afford a new one. I have purchased dozens over the last few years, and places like EKAGS has supplied good quality machines at a reasonable price. Every once and a wile you will get a lemon, but it makes a difference who you deal with ( what the outcome will be. )  Recently that happened and I got a quick response, and returned the notebook and was sent another Dell.  Many Thanks, Sparkey::Sparkey::4.0::September 23, 2013

RHIGS8OFHAL2::Kinda p'd off::This machine came and hooked up to the internet and will search where you can do basic things  like FB and chat! It came w/out sound card, won't recognize plug and play devices. Like it came missing certain main functions. So now we will have to spend more money to get it fixed! The reason we bought one was because of the good reviews. This doesn't deserve the good reviews at all! Good luck with yours if you decide to buy????::Melissa Reynolds::2.0::September 15, 2013
R3NV9B5ACUOQRP::Decent computer, but fake Windows??::I got what I expected for a refurbished Dell 630; it was slow as sin and took about four hours of cleaning, installing speed up software and removing unwanted programs.What I am not pleased about is every time I log on, I get a notice that the version of Windows installed is not genuine...what's up with that??  It is working, but if this is pirated software, that is pretty lame on the vendors part.::ErickO::3.0::September 3, 2013

R1Z9BJVBC1FCIE::This is a tough little workhorse of a laptop::This is my second Dell Latitude D630.  I chose to buy another one because it is one tough laptop.  The first one suffered hard use and kept on working.  It looks like it went through a war.  Still works, by the way, but I needed a second laptop for work so I just got another one.  I chose a "like new / refurbished" previously owned one for it's great price tag but when it arrived it looked totally unused and works perfectly.  Love the screen, NO reflections from bright light or sun, same as the old one.  I think the old one will be my streaming movie entertainment center.  I know it's not as fast as the new ones but it's a Duo-core and it is plenty fast.  Runs Windows 7 and I have nothing bad to say about this laptop what-so-ever.::S. Wallace::5.0::August 27, 2013
R3IFY2MMTU535F::Perfect casual laptop - very sturdy::A great laptop to take on a business trip or vacation.  It won't sting too badly if it's broken or "lost".I replaced the 80gig hdd with a 250 gig ssd and added 1 gig of memory to bring it to 3 gig total.  It boots up very quickly. The battery works fine but still for $25 I replaced it with a 9-cell long life battery.It showed me all the available wireless networks.It's now running win 7 pro 32 bit.  The 2.2ghz dual core processor is fast enough to play my hi def movies just fine (Of course the screen is not hi def). I did not expect it to be able to play my movies, it was a nice surprise.::M. Eames::5.0::August 26, 2013
R3LOJ0NEDJKBCF::Good Laptop::The Dell D630's were made in 2007 and 2008 and are a nice sturdy and rugged laptop--not like some of the all plastic ones. So it weights a bit more and the technology is 5-6 years old. It's also had 5-6 years of prior use. I need a sturdy laptop for some stuff I do so I gave this a shot. I also needed it right away. I bought this from Red Tag on Amazon and he sent me a good laptop and I've had only a couple small problems. Like the Windows Office included was only a Trial version--not what I wanted. I paid extra for that a 2 extra MB of RAM--the RAM is fine. I left 5 stars because it's a nice clean unit and works well. Pre-sale communication was good, but post sale was erratic. Red Tag has 100% positive feedback.The big thing you have to consider when buying a refurb is price vs value to you. Sure the refurbs are cheaper, but not that much cheaper when you consider that for an extra hundred +/- you can get a brand new laptop, never before used with a 1 year warranty. After looking I see many of the refurbs are way overpriced and I should have bought a new one with new technology.That hundred bucks I may have saved may come back to bite me. Any problems and one little repair will be over $100 so you may want to shop around before you buy a refurb. There are better refurb prices too out there--I discovered later. Next time I'll buy a new laptop, just for the newer technology, warranty, and no prior use. Some of these refurbs and used are way too expensive. Look around the internet first. Prices have really dropped on new laptops too and these refurbs should drop too.I've used mine everyday for nearly 3 months and so far it's fine. For now.::1eyejacks::4.0::August 22, 2013
R1J6M3GOJF6D6Q::Great used laptop for the money::I bought my laptop four months ago and it has held up nicely. I use it constantly because I run an online business, and it's a great little workhorse. The only complaint I have is that the sound is very faint. I have to turn the volume all the way up to hear it decently from the speakers. It's most likely a flaw in the particular computer I got since it's used. But other than that, I have no complaints. This machine has served me well.::M. Tucker::4.0::August 21, 2013
R37M4ML5EE3DOQ::Great second laptop to have in the house.::Even though this was a refurbished product, it looks and works like it was purchased brand new.

It works fine but the battery life is less than 30 minutes.  So as long as I have it plugged into the wall it is a good machine.  The only negative is the battery life being so short.

It really does matter what seller you buy from on amazon and this guy is amazing :) He shipped my pc very quickly, it came with 2.4 ghz instead of 2.0 and a better battery. He listens to his customers and cares and upgraded my ram from 2 mb to 3 mb for only $10 extra. Plus he gave me a 9 cell battery which has a long battery life :)LOL.....I felt like I needed to spread the good word about how good the seller All About PC Parts is on here. I recommend anyone to buy from this seller because they over deliver and care about their customers. My laptop looks brand new nearly!So now to the laptop.

It does the job.  I did not get it for high level entertainment.  My child of course is playing games on it and accessing the internet.  I dare not hide it again.  She seems happy enough.  My child tells me this is the computer that her teachers use in middle school.  The price was extremely affordable.

R1SAYXZJSGCXKI::Well Worth It::I purchased this refurbished about 6 months ago and have been more than pleased with it.  Having been a Mac user since the beginning, I did a lot of research before I decided to buy a PC, let alone a used one.  I was not expecting another Mac, but I wanted a good, daily functional workhorse to have as a backup since my Mac is on its last legs.  It does the basics very well, so I have no complaints about that.  It's also nice to have 4 USB ports instead of 2, and to have a few Windows programs that have proven useful.My only complaint is that the battery is dead within 6 months.  Replacements are not too expensive, so I can live with that.::Barbarianz::4.0::February 28, 2013

Saved about $180, too..Follow up:  I bought this computer for my wife for Christmas, two years ago.  Everything worked as described above until a week ago - when it would no longer access the internet. It appeared the wireless modem had failed.  I figured that was the end of that computer but I just happened to have an old wireless addapter PCMIA card that I hadn't used for years, plugged it in and it worked like new.

I bought this Laptop for a job that didn't come though, but I am planning to use it as a back up or to use on trips so if I do lose it no real big deal.

R33J686Z9MQIVG::Usability drawbacks really hurt this laptop::I've never used a Samsung laptop but had no preconceived notions about the Samsung. I've used IBM/Lenovos, Dells, Sonys, Acers, Toshibas, Gateways - you name it and used most of the non-Apple laptops over the last 20 years in IT. I'm not going into which one I like best, but I can say definitively that this Samsung has the worst track pad & keyboard that I've ever used. As much as I tried, I've had to disable the track pad in order to use the keyboard and carry a wireless mouse with me at all times - WTF! What's the point of having a laptop if I can't use the track pad/keyboard at the same time on the road? I've seen other Samsungs which don't have as much of an issue with the track pad, but almost all users of Samsungs have some complaint about the track pad, keyboard or both. The internal specs are decent with a i5 i5-480M / 2.66 GHz CPU, 4GB RAM (expandable to 8GB), but a below average Hard Drive (320 GB) and poor-to-mid battery life make this a laptop I would not recommend to others. In a crowded and intensely competitive mid-range laptop space, I can't see how the Samsung line will survive if it can't even master the most basic of laptop features (keyboard/track pad).::Rajan Kapur::2.0::September 4, 2012
R1RNL3SUFR6C5W::First Laptop::As I was entering my first year of college, I knew that having a laptop would be much more handy and more convenient for a college student. I was kind of on a budget and the macbook was out of the question. I didn't want anything too big, since I bring this with me to school sometimes. As I was browsing around looking for the perfect size laptop, I cam across this one - the Samsung SF310. It has a unique shape to it. Although the screen may be a little bit small, it's still manageable. The laptop is not too heavy and it's a very compact size. Would I recommend this to first time laptop owners? Yes.::Cathy Trinh::4.0::August 13, 2013
R1S5G2V5LT6ENK::Budget laptop, budget performance::This is no over-achieving laptop. It's good, but not great. Biggest downfall is the screen, which has a very restricted viewing angle. If you're anything but dead-straight, it's not sharp.Battery performance is about 2 hours on a full charge, even after upgrading to SSD drive.Touchpad is very finicky, forced to use a mouse.The CD drive seems to open by itself if you're holding the laptop from the side and your hand presses against it (without touching the eject button).It's a little heavy. Sound from the speakers is low.::Shadi Safadi::2.0::May 13, 2013

R1NZC1F734S2PC::WARNING DO NOT BUY::I agree with the other reviewer, it is difficult to type on this computer.  But there are OH SO MANY REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS COMPUTER.  WASTE OF MONEY!  NIGHTMARE!  Yes, all type disappears for no reason ALL THE TIME. Also, however, battery life:  they told me 7 hours.  Well, not really,  but anyway, for however long (I think 5 at best) -- when it gets down to the last 7%, a dialog box starts FLASHING ON YOUR SCREEN "BATTERY LOW 7%"  -- you plug the cord in, but THE FLASHING DOESNT STOP IT JUST KEEPS FLASHING AND YOU CANT DO ANYTHING TILL IT CHARGES.  PLUS, the windows are stored down on your toolbar, but loads of times you just can't pull them up -- it's a tease, they start to come up, but disappear.  The cursor skips, the mousepad is jumpy, you could kill yourself trying to write a paragraph.  just in this review I lost the type twice (i have control z at the ready all the time).

RJC4AI1AHW94V::WARNING!!!!::I just got this computer, brand new less then 2 months ago and am already having a major keyboard problem.  According to HP the keyboard has fused, causing it to want to print, or turning every keystroke into a "control" keystroke.  Because of this I can't even send out simple IM's, type up letters, or anything.  HP refuses to allow me to take it to a local shop to be fixed, instead they insist I ship it to them at the cost of $40 for "one way" shipping.  I KNOW it does not cost $40 to ship a laptop this size with insurance for $40, not even over night shipping.  I am VERY disappointed that HP is refusing to honor their warranty.  The fact that they seemed to know this is an issue makes it even more disappointing.Update a few months later.  I got the keyboard fixed.  Still having some keyboard issues.  Certain keys just don't want to worry correctly.  One key needs to be replaced again.  More importantly, I am having other problems as well.  Web cam is not working at all.  It is taking a very long time to shut down, normal shut down for it is at least 5 minutes, but often will take up to 30.  On a few occasions it has taken hours to shut down.  More then once it simply would NOT shut down, causing it to need to be forced to shut down.  Which causes problems on start up.  Some times there are problems on start up without it having trouble shutting down.  I often get error messages when starting it.  Including one that says "Purging memory"  That one I don't like.  So far it hasn't actually purged any of my information.  The simplest of programs cause it to run slow.  Sadly it runs slower then my last computer at times, and it wasn't even a full 1g.  while more complex programs like World of Warcraft it runs fine.  Yet another game I play, it destroys the graphics no matter how I change the settings.  It is also now doing a strange new thing with the screen going completely black for a few seconds at random times.  Why it is doing this I have no clue.  Many of the times it has done this I won't even be touching the computer or running anything.  So far it has been coming back also without me doing anything, since actually trying to bring it back by hitting keys does nothing.  My husband has run diagnostics on it and can not find anything wrong with it.  HP won't honor the warranty without knowing what is wrong with it.  They want to keep it test it for a price.::Daisy Ward "Crazylady"::1.0::March 29, 2011
R119DEBRGT8X9M::Doesn't come with a cam::I have two of these computers.  I bought one in the store for myself, because my old computer died, and when my girlfriend at the time broke hers, I bought this one for her, and even though it looks like it has a cam, it does not, though the computer itself functions well enough for its price.  A couple of weeks later the hard drive malfunctioned and had to be replaced.  My original store bought one still works ok.  I think of it as the boad because of how slow it is to get going or to change direction.  I initially bought it because of the big screen to watch movies and play some old computer games as I am not really a graphix person, but it really was a mistake and I wish that I had done some more research.::Joseph Parker "precisionspared"::3.0::May 26, 2011
R34P2YBGE31K8J::G73SW-XA1::Just received this laptop. It does NOT come with a backpack or a mouse (it was written that backpack and mouse are included in G73SW-XA1 on Amazon's product page, but this text was later removed). :-(The material quality is great. Feels sturdy. Quite heavy, as expected.Screen is glossy and has 1920*1080 resolution.Windows experience index details are:Processor - 7.4RAM - 7.6Graphics - 7.0Gaming graphics - 7.0Primary hard disk - 5.9Computer has 8GB of 1333Mhz RAM (4x 2GB), so it'll be expensive to upgrade RAM to 12GB(2*2 + 4*2) or 16GB(4*4) (since there are no extra free slots and you'll have to throw away existing RAM).There is an empty 2.5" HDD compartment where I'm planning to install OCZ Technology 120 GB Vertex 2 Series SATA II 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive (SSD) OCZSSD2-2VTXE120G (I like the 750GB HDD + 120GB SSD configuration better than 500GB HDD + 500GB HDD).Hard disk comes partitioned 174GB in C:\ and 502GB in D:\. Lots of stuff that I had to deinstall. The disk is Seagate ST9750420AS.DVD writer drive is Matshita UJ8A0ASW (supports burning to Dual Layer 8.5GB DVD+R DL). WiFi is Atheros AR9285. Bluetooth is Broadcom BT-270.For those of you who have heard about the Intel Sandy Bridge problem - yes, it does have "New revision. Certified design" sticker.Also has "NVidia 3DTVPLAY" sticker, so it should be possible to connect laptop to a 3D-capable TV or projector via HDMI.Overall, I highly recommend this laptop.::DMITRI KIVILEV::5.0::March 17, 2011
R2R1SGX7XNXO6M::a worthy gaming notebook that does not break your budget::my last gaming notebook, was an alienware area 51M, made when alienware was not owned by dell and before dell messed up a great gaming notebook maker.Alienware Area 51M 5620 Laptop Battery (Replacement)I needed a newer notebook as that and my 4 yr old toshiba were long in the tooth. I was not looking for a gaming notebook, but as this is not much more money for a gaming notebook. Now this notebook is huge, view it as a desktop replacement. Asus has also improved and not having a ton of bloatware. It is pretty much remove from box, remove wrappers, place battery inside, and fire it up and get to work. I love the layout of it. awesome keyboard, straight forward approach.It runs quiet, and doesnt require fiddling with the setup, such a relief these days.If the P4 extreme alienware area 51m, was not a dead give away... I'm and old gamer. I was playing crush crumble and chomp and soldering 6502 microprocessors, when many of you were not even born lol.I love how the hard drive is setup with the partitions that make sense. Just be sure and setup your games on the 500gb partition and installing them there.All the normal issues with new computers I have not seen here. The manual is crap on real geeky useful information, but whose isnt these days. The designers think we are all idiots, which is mostly true, but give me useful info.. took me awhile to figure out which hdmi cable I need to hook this up to my 55in samsung.So, If you are in the need for a decent gaming notebook, and are not worried about size, weight, or battery life.You know who you are when you buy a 17in notebook which is a desktop replacement, and then post a 1 star review complaining about how heavy it is, blah blah.THIS IS A DESKTOP REPLACEMENT GAMING NOTEBOOK!it weighs in at 8 pounds, it wont fit on the drop drown tray on the airplane unless you wedge it and halfway thru your lost season 3 dvd the battery will die anyway.I am quite pleased with it as I transfer my games to this. Just buy it and you will be happy.Very solid notebook.::Donald Bergin::5.0::March 18, 2011
RYNTBR9MIOLD4::Best Bang for the Buck::***UPDATE: Amazon has sent a credit of 50.00 to compensate for the backpack and mouse.I think that it goes without saying that this laptop gives you the most bang for the buck. I am not so much the PC gamer but I use applications which weigh heavily on the graphics card and processor. So far this laptop has been able to handle everything I can throw at it.Pros:i7 2.0ghz with (fixed) Sandy Bridge Technology8GB RAM (expensive to upgrade to 16GB)1.5GB Video Memory (beats best buys model by 512MB and 100.00)750GB Hard Drive 7200RMP (again beats best buys model by 250GB)LED Display, bright and does not wash out from multiple anglesIlluminated KeyboardUSB 3.0 (1x)Cons:Sound card...ugh. The Realtek sound card is of poor quality, the mic input is simply that. You cannot switch to line input, hopefully a fix for this will come in the future.Bloatware, be prepared to spend some time uninstalling all of the useless tools and applications that come with this computer.No backup disc, you must create your own (5 DVD's required)Amazon said in description they would provide a gaming mouse and backpack, never arrived and was removed from product description... Shame on you Amazon.The cons although annoying are not in any way deal breakers, this is a solid laptop with screaming performance from a great company. You will not find a better laptop for the price. 4 stars on this review, lost 1 star mainly for the sound card and bloatware. Amazon should make good on the backpack on mouse, those who rated the product 1 star because they did not get them should think about reviewing the laptop and not Amazon.::Amazon Customer::4.0::March 21, 2011
R3S4Q75FFW89RW::NOT ready for prime time::the specs and value of this machine is very nice.  after i accidentally spilled soda on my HP HDX18 laptop (twice...), i decided to get a real gaming notebook.  the Asus G73JW was the best value on paper compared to any other machine I could find out there (Toshiba Qosimo, Alienware, Sager, etc).the Good:video card = very nice (Nvidia 460M - see notebookcheckdotcom for the specs and ratings)runs very cool = I was very impressed by the overall cooling system.  found a review that measured all the temperatures on the keyboard as well as vents in the back.  compared to my HP, this was very comfortable and never got hot or even very warm under my hands when typing.  never realized how warm my HP was until i started using this.the OK:most everything else is good enough.  memory, hard drive, screen (although, i miss the 18.4" HP screen which was very nice.  the 17" looks dinky when you get used to the 18" especially at the 1920x1080 resolution).the Bad:sound is poor.keyboard = chiclet style keys which i don't like (but, this is a personal preference).--the Kicker:when i first got it, it would freeze up occasionally.  not often enough for it to be consistent, but enough to be kind of irksome.  did the updates, etc, and it seemed pretty stable.  after 4 months of use, it died.  wouldn't boot at all.  tech support was kind of a hassle - won't bore you details, but HP's tech support was excellent compared to ASUS'.  after going through the RMA process, i received the laptop yesterday.  the keyboard wasn't installed properly - was loose and flapping, i found that a screw wasn't even screwed down on the mother board (this was so obvious, even i could see it...) and i think there is a screw missing.  the ASUS repair shop that did this, well, imo, sucks and it looks very shoddily done.  the real problem is that now, after the repairs, it constantly freezes up.  it is unusable.  i have contacted ASUS tech once again, but i'm very disappointed w/ the machine's reliability at the moment.so, at this time, i can't recommend this machine.  i think ASUS really needs to step up their notebook quality checks.  (i have asus monitors which are excellent.)i'll update this review later after the next set of tech support.--update May 25, 2011received the 2nd RMA laptop.  turnaround was quick.they replaced the keyboard (w/ a different color one for some reason) and hard drive (which now makes a clicky noise once in a while).  again, new setup.after setting up windows, it did it's asus live update and windows update... still freezes!  sometimes tries to boot, and then shuts itself down.  sometimes fails to even show bios screen... basically, the same thing as before.3rd contact to tech support in progress.--a lot of the positive reviews seem to be immediate impressions.  i have to say, mine was very high as well when i first got it.  it's really the long term problems that i think this laptop has and all the little issues that seems to pop up (to me and to many others) that i never really had w/ other laptops.::GrayD "GrayD"::2.0::May 11, 2011
R1NPN6TVUXPGNO::awesome! but::So, I got this beast a few days ago and the first 12-15 hours I spent debugging the other 6 hours installing updates. This notebook is built very tough and stays cool, basically all of the comments before mine appear to be correct so far. The GPU is fantastic and the sandy bridge gives you 8 threads of beastliness (the CPU). Display is gorgeous and the material used very comfy and nice to the touch. This machine is very very quite even at full load and does not heat up.Note:At some point the keyboard lights will not turn on for you. If pressing Fn+F4 does nothing, you will need to download the ATK driver from ASUS and do Repair>Restart TWICE. After that they will function again.::Amazon Customer::4.0::April 28, 2011
RZSIAN2FUGZFB::More-than-worthy replacement for my desktop::I did quite a bit of research before deciding to purchase this laptop, so I was well aware of other user's reports of Sandybridge problems, function key issues, preponderances of bloatware, etc.  Here are some thoughts about critiques I've read:I can say that the Sandybridge issue appears to be a thing of the past, and my computer shipped with a sticker certifying that it had been reviewed and updated (I bought it in May 2011).  I have not seen any Sandybridge-related issues after a couple of weeks of hard use.I did run into the function key issue, but there is already good documentation out there on how to fix it.  Supposedly, some of the Win 7 64 bit updates screw up ASUS' ATK drivers (and result in the function keys not working anymore).  Simply removing the ATK drivers and reinstalling from ASUS' website fixes the problem.[...]I've read that some users needed to do this twice, but that was not the case for me.  I would recommend installing all of the important Win 7 updates BEFORE re-installing the ATK drivers.There WAS quite a bit of bloatware that came with this laptop, but it is easily removable.  Some users report going to the lengths of reformatting their hard drives, but I did not find that to be necessary.  Remove the software from the control panel, and then sweep through the C:\ to remove any remnants.  That should be more than adequate.  Most folks who need this kind of processing power out of their laptop probably have the know-how to get this done pretty quickly.I'm not sure why people are complaining about the sound quality.  Sure, it won't compare to studio monitors or your 7.1 surround system in your home theater... but it's a laptop... not sure what you were expecting.  It has good sound compared to most laptops I've heard (although probably not the best).  If you need better or bigger sound, use nice headphones... or run it through a stereo receiver.This is a big laptop.  It's not super light or super portable.  When you buy a 17.3" laptop, you forfeit portability.  If that was a surprise to you, you should have done more research.  'Nuff said.All in all, I spent an hour or two removing bloatware, updating drivers, adding software, and downloading/installing Windows updates... and then this computer was ready to rock.  And rock it does.  I have yet to run an application or game that this workstation can't handle with ease.  The screen is sharp, the keyboard is nice, and it stays cool after hours of hard use.  That is everything I was looking for.My only real complaint is that the brick on the power cord is very big, bulky, and heavy.  It's roughly 8"x4"x3", and I estimate that it weighs 3-4 lbs.  Given that this computer is intended to be used while plugged in (primarily), you can't really get away with not lugging the cord around with you.  It'd be great if ASUS did a little R&D; and shrunk it down a bit.  Is anyone aware of a reliable, safe, compatible, and SMALL power cord/conditioner that I could look into?::Z Clip::5.0::May 18, 2011
R15EMGHVCABH71::EDITED: Finally fixed most: Problems ever since I got it, stutters, system restore didn't work, function keys did not work::Bought the ASUS G73SW-XA1 currently for sale.System restore came bugged and had to messed with to work properly.Function keys did not work properly either, had to delete drivers and reinstall ones from the website.Installed Installed Medieval Total War 2 and Shogun Total War 2.Both games have lag and stuttering issues on the campaign map and the battle maps.It more than meets the specs on Medieval and no matter what I set the graphics settings for the game (low or high) the lag issues still occur.I have tried multiple builds including with initial build, Asus auto driver updates, windows updates, and the new GTX 460M drivers seperately and all give the same problems (Note the GTX 460M updated drivers cause the screen to flicker also).Have also tried before and after uninstalling bloatware and have reset it to factory settings 3 times now with the same results.Is there any recourse for this?  This is the first item I have purchased from Amazon and it seems to be broken.I'm wondering for the people who have used it to play games what did you do to get it to actually work without lag during games?Thanks,ChrisEdit: Forgot to add whenever I run anything it sounds like the fan is on overdrive.Edit: Finally fixed stuttering you need to get the Nvidia beta drivers.Overall,PROS: higher end hardware for good priceCONS: So much work to fix the screwed up factory settings and the ASUS auto update crap.::Chris C.::3.0::April 8, 2011
R2AM87BVUC2MTB::Asus G73SW "Bertha" is her name!::Okay where should i start?First off, you're probably doing the same thing i did when deciding to buy this computer. Checking reviews, looking up facts, researching data and all that.I'll say this and save you some trouble...BUY IT!!! i can't speak for the few people that had major problems when they bought this laptop but i haven't had any of those yet, had a few bugs but no major problems...Knocking on Wood...The computer is fast. really. really. really. fast!!!Handles anything i can throw at it...doesn't overheat, no time lags or slow up on multiple windows.I'm not a gamer but i do video editing and movie making with this and the software that comes with, makes it really easy to do.Also using this laptop for "veejaying," creating mixed DVDs and the laptop powers thru, actually, i wouldn't say that, more like barely works up a sweat.I bought the 750gb model, then added an additional 750gb, because there is an extra hard drive bay, just make sure you order a hard drive caddy.Now, i wouldn't be honest if i didn't say i've had a few issues that i had to work thru...like the keyboard back lighting problem, i had that.(it was a simple fix.)The "bsod" or blinking display problem, had to re-install my nvidia drivers.But other than that, none of the horror stories that some of the other customers had. Thankfully i haven't had to deal with the god awful customer service that ASUS is so famous for.I mean, seriously, how can your customer service be THAT bad...if you're dealing with computers and laptops?! Getting sidetracked, the bottom line is this...This laptop KICKs as...uhh...butt!Again i haven't had any of the major problems those few customers had, not taking away anything from them, i feel bad that they didn't experience the best this computer has to offer...but for me.....?Best $1400 i've spent in the last 3 years.One thing i did forget to mention, it is a biiiiiiiiiiig 17" laptop, not many 17" laptop bags can fit this thing, had to actually buy an asus bag which fits it perfectly.It's why she's called "Bertha."No offense to any lady named Bertha... v(*^_^*)v::Lee Haynes::5.0::June 23, 2011
R2UT1W63WR43LV::An 8 pound desktop that can handle work and gaming.::Have had it for a week and a half now.I needed a laptop with a big enough screen to have multiple windows open for work and I wanted it to be able to have a game running in the background too.  Basically I wanted a desktop that I could move in a backpack so that I could work from wherever I want.Pros:* Stays cool:  the extra size was put to good use with the cooling system.* Quality feel:  some laptops just feel cheap, this one doesn't.* All black no extra LED's.  Just because I like to game doesn't mean I want it to look like a slot machine.* Gaming:  tried Rift, Left for Dead 2 and Civ V with high settings and no problems.* Can double as our upstairs tv for Hulu and Amazon prime movies.* Backlit keyboard (this is where those LED's are supposed to be)* Nice high contrast screen with fairly good viewing angles for a laptop.* Battery life is nearly 3 hours with multiple browsers, office apps and Pandora open.Cons:* Does not fit in many standard 17" bags.  (The Targus XL backpack however fits it just right.)* Straight plug for power adapter input instead of `L' shaped.  (far enough back though that it doesn't interfere with mouse)* Bloatware (does anyone actually use this stuff?)* It's a glossy screen that isn't super bright so outside in the daylight is a bit difficult.* 1 year warranty instead of 2.My initial impressions are really positive and I would not have purchased this if there was anything better at this price point.  I'll update after I've had it for awhile.The below writeup is really nice quick guide to getting rid of most of the useless bloatware that actually uses system resources as well as a guide to ensuring that your GPU/CPU were properly assembled with their cooling devices (heatsink/fan/thermal paste).(search for "Unboxing your G73: A short setup guide." It's on the Notebook Review Forum)Mine was in the mid 70's Celsius under load, so I'm pretty happy.::Magellan::5.0::March 28, 2011
R3BS970USD9P0J::Good System, Asus Software and Docs Need Help::Overall, I like this machine.  It's a fantastic value.  The screen is great, bright and clear with a lot of real estate for a laptop.  Big improvement over my old 17" Dell Ultra-Sharp.  The keyboard has a solid, comfortable feel.  The system is heavy, but that's not an issue for me - it will rarely, if ever, be leaving my desk area.  There is a fair amount of bloatware that needs to be uninstalled at first use.It's very quiet yet the bottom stays cool, even during extended operation.  However, although it is fast enough, I estimate only a 15%-20% boot-up speed pick-up over my 42 month old desktop (Q6600/4 gb RAM/GeForce 8800GT w/256mb/Vista 32).I have not yet tested the system with modern games.  I do own a number of "classic" titles between 2 and 15 years old. Three of the more recent, World in Conflict, Company of Heroes, and Civ IV, all play easily with graphics settings at or near the maximum.If you are connecting external speakers or plan to use headphones/ear-buds extensively, I recommend turning off the THX software that is enabled by default and using the included RealTek audio software instead.  The THX software works well with the internal speakers.I have a couple small issues, the most significant of which is likely caused by my ignorance and poor documentation rather than a problem with the machine.  The keyboard lights up during the POST, then turns off and stays off.  The e-manual references <fn><space bar> as the on/off switch for the keyboard lighting, but this combination does not work for me.  The lighting button at top left only turns the lighting on and off for - wait for it - the lighting button itself plus the other two "special" buttons.  So the hardware works but is being overridden by a software setting that I can't locate.  Frustrating.  The documentation should be more clear.Additionally, Asus includes its own "live update" software that offers newer software and drivers.  If for whatever reason you choose not to accept everything that is offered, you will receive a pop-up notification a few minutes after each boot.  The only way to disable this is to uninstall the software, meaning you may miss something in the future that you actually DO want to install.  There are also no embedded descriptions explaining the updates and their purposes.There is also an "instant-on" capability (not Windows) that comes with a primitive but functional web browser, a music player, and some primitive casual games.  Waste of time and disk space IMO in this age of tablets and smart phones.All-in-all a very good system, but docked one star due to weak Asus software and documentation.::Rich57::4.0::April 25, 2011
RNEQ0DN146KFG::Great laptop::Although it failed to arrive with the advertised backpack and mouse I have no regrets with my purchase. I recieved a quick discount due to the error. This machine has handled everything I have thrown at it. I play World of Warcraft and this machine handles all aspects of the game with ease. Tol Barad, raids, fighting the 3 platoons of adds before the last boss in The Stonecore and no lag. This is with expolsive traps, muti shots and other players AoE flying at once. The great sound system enhances my music and video playing as well. It is huge so take it with you to buy a case. I believe this was a great purchase. Maybe I got lucky but when I failed to realize I had missed a driver update the customer service I recieved when contacting ASUS was quick and helpful when my backlit keyboard stopped backlighting. Everthing works after we realized my error.::cutigeriv::5.0::April 19, 2011
R1ZXKNXBPWWM6I::After some tweaks, very satisfied.::It's running crysis 2 flawlessly on advanced graphics settings and I am picky. By default it goes to "hardcore" and runs well enough for most people. I prefer a very high framerate and set to advanced, which looks pretty much the same, it's excellent. Stays cool, great keyboard for gaming and typing.Cons (why I gave a 4)You will have an issue with the function keys including keyboard backlighting after some windows updates. To fix this you'll need to reinstall ATK from the utility disc TWICE (don't ask why, but its on the forums and its exactly what it took for me.)The screen brightness and contrast are very far off by default regardless of which splendid setting you use. I, along with many others, removed splendid. If you use windows color correction in control panel and drag gamma way to the dark side your blacks will actually look black and light colors wont be washed out. The most obvious place to see how bad it is is in WoW. Just look at your buttons and you'll see.After these changes and removing all the garbage including power4gear, u'll be kicking butt.OH ONE MORE THING!DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF PURCHASING THIS LAPTOP WITHOUT ALSO PURCHASING A CARRYING CASE - MESSENGER BAG, BACKPACK, OR OTHERWISE - THAT FITS ITS HUGE SIZE! You will be immediately sorry because everything I tried at best buy was too tight. I ended up getting a targus blacktop http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCV7FW and am currently waiting for it to arrive. It is one of the most recommended for this laptop.Good luck!::asifuserealname::4.0::April 18, 2011
RJUY9EUUHNI9H::Good product for the price::Ordered on Friday, one-day shipping got it to me on Monday the following week.Computer is as described; the system itself with necessary peripherals - AC adaptor and wall plug, utility CD (not the recovery disc, you have to burn those yourself = about 2 hours with 5 or 6 DVDs). DOes not come with carrying bag or mouse.Seems to be what it is described so far: tech specs as described in product description: 750GB HDD, nvidia 460m and i7 2630QM processor. Note that it is the revised processor, therefore not the old Sandybrdige. It is the NEW one.Comes with some bloatware, but can be uninstalled without too much difficulty.Sound quality is quite good - not tinny and carries some 'body' well. Has a subwoofer.Had a minor problem of the Function+F1/2/3..etc keys not working. Reinstalled the ATK driver package from the Control Panel > Uninstall Programs and restarted computer. All fixed without problems.So far, no other problems. Web cam is somewhat choppy (very low FPS) and does not have very good quality (claims to be 2.0 MPix), but otherwise everything else is great. Bear in mind that this is a gaming laptop, so it is BIG (17" screen) and heavier than most other laptops!::CR::5.0::March 22, 2011
R3HL03M0VA59VO::I love this laptop! [Edit]: I used to love it...::I'm really pleased with this laptop. The only thing is that the touch pad wants to do its own thing sometimes. I don't know if that's something that I can fix or if it's something I'm going to have to deal with.[Edit]: The port where the charging cable goes in has gone bad or something. I've replaced the battery and the charger will charge other computers fine. I have to do all sorts of acrobats to get the thing to charge. I've never had a problem like this, and I don't think I'll buy another ASUS product since I've had longer-lasting products from other companies.::Brooklyn Rainwaters::3.0::October 1, 2011
R1CD3JN51QBKVA::Not running as well as I had hoped::I purchased this laptop about a week ago and it has not been easy to use yet. I got it because of its amazing spec's and expected it to run through everything i could throw at it with ease. I installed WoW and have been playing it on ultra high settings and it looks great but i often get lag/stutters and/or disconnected for a reason not obvious to me. My fps are between 30-60 and internet running at a steady 150 mbps. It also seems to have difficulty browsing the internet, i use mozilla firefox and yahoo as my home page, i dont see why it has trouble loading my homepage or any other page such as: youtube,stumble, anything with pictures, video, plugins, content... does not run as well as it should. I have done the windows updates, currently installing the asus live update for the nvidia 3d stereoscopic drivers, which is taking hours. Updated java and adobe. I have been comparing this to my nearly 10 year old desktop, which besides its horrible graphics, seems to run programs and download everything as quickly as this laptop. I have it set to high performance, the cpu never exceeds 15% and ram never over 30%. As far as i know i have everything updated but its not meeting my expectations. If anyone has anyone suggestions/questions please comment. I am trying to work with this laptop, I thought it had everything i needed.Thanks!Update 5/16/2011: Solved almost all of my issues. Happy to say that. Basically had to go through the notebook review forums and found tons of help there. Deleted crapware. The most important thing i did, in my opinion, was simply going to the asus website. I went to the website and found my model computer, and then at the bottom of the screen it has an option for downloads. These downloads, which i wish they would have simply told me about, were all much needed updates for the laptops components. Downloaded most of them and it is running well now. But wow there were so many little bugs. Glad that is over with.Now my last issue which im hoping will be solved more easily... I purchased the Case Logic VNC-17 17-inch Value Slimline Laptop Case for $26.99 (recommended by amazon for my laptop). It is probably 2 inches from comfortably fitting the laptop in it. Returns are easy with amazon blahblahblah... printed out the label and just went to ups to send it back. I paid around $23.00 to return it. I am hoping amazon will comp me for the shipping costs as well as the carrying case. "Self Return: Take package to post office or other mailing service. You will need to pay return shipping charges directly to the carrier. Because your return is the result of our error, estimated return shipping costs of up to $6.76 associated with your return will be refunded to you. " Hopefully more than $6.76. If that is all then i mind as well have kept it and went to a store bought a new one and returned this one in its place. Would have saved money and time.::Tom::4.0::May 4, 2011

R3753A5AXVLVMD::Wow-Incredible Bargain!::Just received this today. I have already created recovery discs. Have experienced no performance issues. Really fast! Gorgeous full HD display. Has a WEI of 5.9 as Dmitri said and it will go to a 7.0 if you replace the 7200 rpm hard drive with an ssd. Stays cool-primary reason for choosing this model among other brands with similar hardware. Crysis never looked so good - on high too! Will install SolidWorks as rendering poses no problem. Also it's 3d capable using a 120 Hz. external monitor and Nvidia kit(purchased separately). Great price for this quality! Can't do better elsewhere. Buy with confidence. Thanks Amazon!::Paul A. Bonyak "math addict"::5.0::April 16, 2011
R16HD9DBVT3L3K::Couldn't be happier.::This is my first and most likely my last review on Amazon. Usually I just read the comments and decide for myself whether the product is worthwhile, but this time, I hope to help the readers with my experience, and maybe answer the same questions I had. I spent nearly 20 hours searching for the best possible balance between price and specifications. I was hesitant on this laptop for several reasons. For one I play WoW. For those that don't know, it's a very demanding game graphically. To be honest, that was my only concern. The CPU/RAM/HD, those are the things that come standard on every machine. No gaming laptop dares to use an i5 nowadays, unless they're Alienware, in which case, you might as well burn your money before further feeding the trolls facilitating the pricing at that company. An equivalent machine from Alienware would run you over two thousand, and I checked. A 17" AW still lacks the 1080p. Seriously? Brands shouldn't charge an extra thousand for their terrible reputation, and their customer service script reading monkeys.So the pros:-The display is simply amazing. High gloss with 1080p. Everything looks pristine. Just simply gorgeous.-I was really dreading the keyboard, based on reviews, until I was able to finally try it for myself. It's great. Bright and spaced, and has a soft touch.-The design of the laptop looks god awful on the site. Not in person. It's brilliant. Has a really unique and comfortable texture, both on the exterior and the palm rest area. Really has that stealthy high tech design the engineers were going for. Superb.-The graphics card pulls strong. The great thing is the "dashboard", the area near the speakers is comprised of mini buttons that interact with the motherboard. They establish the mode of power and display type. So if you're playing a game, run high performance and turn your visuals to "Vivid". Looks great. Or if you're watching a movie, turn it to entertainment mode and run the "Theater" display mode. Great innovation on this machine.The only con I have is the sound. My previous laptop was an XPS 1530, and the music on that machine, through headphones, was really amazing. I haven't spent enough time running through settings or browsing online to find the necessary configurations to run similar on this machine. I would imagine it should, but maybe the XPS just really excelled in the sound department. Regardless, small infraction for what is top notch engineering from a reputable company.By the way, Amazon is the best company bar none when it comes to customer service. I actually spent a little bit more just to order this machine from them, because regardless of the situation, I know they will actively try and help the customer. And who can beat Prime? 2 Days and I had this on my desk. Most gaming companies will take several weeks just to ship an already pre-configured machine.So for those still on the fence, get off. You will love this machine. And those complaining about the size; it's a gaming 17" laptop. Get over it. It looks small anyhow, compared to the 27" iMac behind it.Cheers.::Zak::5.0::November 10, 2011
R1XY5LZF54DCTX::Short in Power Block cord::3rd time I have turned this laptop on and now there is a short in the power block cord.You think you have your laptop plugged in but then it dies.  Upon inspection, the power blocklight is not on.  Wiggling the cord makes the light go on and off.  Nice!Now I have to go through the hassle of contacting Asus and getting a new power block, etc.The laptop seems great otherwise.::Consumer::3.0::October 25, 2011
R1V3N7C2BABJEY::Love it::I spent about a month researching laptops that would mix value and power. I ended up with this after literally looking at everything at the market. For the price it is completely worth it. Honestly, there is no review or discription that can to justice to this laptop. At it native resolution it can pretty much handle most games at max settings. To find a desktop with monitor combo that is this powerful would be hard at this price range.::Owner::5.0::October 21, 2011
R24N9ODOHGNOHM::Overall OK::Performance-wise it's a good laptop.Keyboard is comfortable.Very much silent.Pretty good value for money.Now the bad:Occasionally will freeze up after I leave it on for about 3 or 4 days, I think it's due to the graphics card.Mic is horrendous.Webcam is really bad.Had problems with fn key combinations at the beginning. Fixed after a system restore.Problems with bluetooth mouse.Very bad touchpad.::Y. Jiang::4.0::October 14, 2011
R27JG66MUAU76C::Amazing powerhouse.::Pros:  -1080p Screen. (Makes everything look extremely smooth.)  -Amazing GPU  -Light up keyboard! (Working at night has never been easier)  -Great heat dissipation. I Have had it for 6 days, have not even heard my fan come on yet. I thought i did once, but that was desktop idling in the background.  -Quick boot-up. After the first boot up, takes no longer than 3 minutes to get to my homescreen.Cons:  -Battery level. Battery is really small, only last about 2~3 hours. Which is pretty sad since i have to have it plugged in all the time. Not much of a con for me because i was looking for a desktop replacement.  -Size. This computer will not fit in your bookbag, Do not even try haha.Really the only con i hate, is battery life. Bought this on the basis that i needed something strong since ill be going to college and want to study computer science. The GPU would help a lot when it came to render times on both after effects and cinema 4d. The battery life screws me though. I wish i had more, however there is no way to turn off the GPU when not in use and instead use the one that comes with the processor. This would increase battery life as i see it, however asus didnt make such a setting available. This computer is going to be a stay at home machine. Im not going to do much moving with it. That is my only reason as to why its not getting 5 stars. At one time i got 1hr and 30mins on a charge just browsing internet. However the way i see it, you can have power, or battery life. Maybe even both. I decided on power however.Alright now down to some benchmarking!(Used Fraps with all of these!)Portal 2:  It is positively amazing. I was expecting low FPS since this is a laptop after all, however i was completely blown away. I maxed every single setting possible, and played on a 1080p resolution. I got steady 60fps. No drops ever. This was really good for me, i think im going to be playing games for a while.Fallout 3:  Set it on ultra. I get 52 fps, with 45 at its lowest. I was blown away by the amount of visual detail this was giving me. My console will never match up with this.Team Fortess 2:  This ones a doozy. Didnt play it much, however at some point I got a FPS rate of about 120 FPS. I maxed as much settings as possible and came to this. Love it a lot.Minecraft:  For the indie game lovers! I got an FPS rate of 180 FPS. Thats on high settings. Get rid of smooth lighting and such you get somewhere aroung 500~600 FPS. I did not even know so much was possible.Lastly, if any of the people reading this know of a case that i can buy for this laptop please inform me. I bought one. But unfortunately it did not fit. Stay away from generic cases. The one i bought left the back of the laptop, where the vents are, completely exposed. Ill have to return this soon.::Rouben Bautista::4.0::October 10, 2011
R3K7JY20YEFG88::Aswome computer::The design is literally striking! It left my coworkers jaw-dropped.I am baffled that this computer exceeded my expectations in every way except one. Microsoft office product keys have a history of being hacked so the product key I used for my computer does not work. I need it since I do business.This is not a lightweight portable laptop, it is a desktop portable replacement laptop.I have the cs5 master collection, not a single flaw.Games are a breeze, I'm allowed to set in ultra.Too many to list::Andy T,::5.0::August 6, 2011
RDH7KHDRJPX99::Great deal price/product::When i bought it, it was a great deal money wise. I looked around to see what i could get for how much it was being offered (1399 atm) but could find nothing that got close to it. I've had it for a month now and it has been running smoothly and without problems. Plays WoW and SC2 in ultra setting at 58-60 fps. Sure, comes with bloatware but so what! you can format and re install windows (you gotta do your back up discs) and avoid the bloatware and you will have a hell of a laptop for much cheaper than anything you could have found in the market::mecheverria::5.0::June 6, 2011
RYONRF99FBC1R::ASUS G73SW-XA1::PRO'S- Overheating is not an issue- Graphics is above par for a Laptop all games max settings no issues- No issues with wireless- Price was right when I purchased at 1399.00, compared to the 1849.99 it is now.- Outstanding Desktop replacementCON'S-You have to remove the keyboard to get at two of the four memory sticks, but i knew that prior to purchase.-No backup disksAll in all this is a great laptop.::Liz Smith::5.0::June 4, 2011
R14ATROVHS9IKP::Awesome laptop computer::I received the G73SW-XA1 three days ago.  This laptop is absolutely amazing.  It is by far the largest laptop I have ever owned.  But it is also the most powerful, has the clearest display, is the coolest (thermally) and quietest laptop I have ever owned.  I use it for casual gaming - no tournament stuff.  I play mostly FPS and RTS games.  With this laptop I can crank the graphics and details to maximum without game play and speed suffering.My daughter gave me a little grief about the size and wanted to immediately begin to compare to her laptop.  Fortunately, she was aware of PC Benchmarks.  She bench marked hers first and then I ran the same benchmarks on the ASUS - it was no comparison.  She immediately closed her laptop and went away - she was in utter shock at the numbers.The facial recognition works very well.I would recommend this computer to anyone that values performance and affordability.::Amazon Customer "Electronics connoisseur"::5.0::May 22, 2011
R9U8LEQWC0T27::Amazing computer for an incredible price::I've always been a computer gamer and I keep looking for a better laptop to play my games while I'll travel. I wanted to change my old alienware with a new one when I found this Asus laptop. I was surprised by the huge price difference from alienware and this Asus to the point that I was suspecting something was wrong with Asus!. But after reading reviews all around Internet I decided to go for it. I had it for a few weeks now and I can say is the best laptop I ever had!The performance of this computer is amazing, the full HD screen is excellent and I have been able to play all of my games at full quality with no lag at all. The cooling system is also another excellent feature, silent and very efficient keeping it cool even when running apps at 100% the only thing I`m missing is the blu-ray unit but it is not a big deal.I would definetely recommend this computer to anyone that wants a very good performance laptop!!::Alejandro Bernal::5.0::April 28, 2011

Its well laid out and has plenty of space for games, music & videos.  I got this great laptop for under $1400 and I would buy another if/when I need one!::Mark Castle "Mark C."::5.0::April 16, 2011
R2EFZQ2AQ3CU6O::BEST LAPTOP I HAVE EVER OWNED, 3DMARK SCORES INCLUDED::So after a lot of thinking and research I finally decided to get this laptop. It works great, it runs great. I installed Maya, Black OPs, Cinema4d, After Effects CS5 master collection and so far no issues. At times Black Ops stutters at ultra settings but even with a little lower settings the game looks great. The keyboard and mouse pad feel very good and high quality. The built in webcam sucks but I use a different one so its ok. It has the revised certification sticker. The USB ports are very sturdy unlike my last laptop. The laptop is heavy but I knew what I was getting myself into. The screen is extremely glossy so be aware that there is gonna be a lot of glare.

R3KCN9OWB8IKA7::Good cost benefit, though lack of information is inconvenient::After using the laptop for about a month, I beleive it is very pleasing.Keyboard is smooth and responsive, contrary to another opinion I heard befor buying it. Trackpad isn't all that much, then again you're not buying a gaming laptop without a mouse. The mouse is an issue I'd like to share though:Another review of this product mentioned how they didn't receive a mouse and backpack that amazon promised to give as a bonus. The description later on removed these bonus items from the list, as if they no longer were valid. Without the info, I assumed I'd have to buy another mouse myself. End story; I invested on a $100 dollar mouse unnecessarily. The bonus items were still valid, but did not inform me, the buyer.As cool as it may be that I now have 2 very good mice, If I had known, My investment would have gone to some other peripherals I had in mind. Backpack was a pretty nice surprise though.Back to he laptop; It`s huge. At first I did not believe what other users said about how hard it can be to carry it around an such, all you need is a backpack, am I right? Wrong.When you`re buying this laptop, your actually buying a portable desktop. It`s weight is not the every day kind of thing you will want to be carrying around.Aside from the weight, the specs are great, design is awesome (although some friends thought I was carrying an old school computer), and performance is pleasing.Haven`t tested any movies with the blu-ray yet. That should be fun.I recommend this laptop for those who like not only to play games, but use computer graphics software and photoshop. The 1920x1080 screen had an important part on deciding which computer to buy.::Diana::4.0::July 20, 2011
RS914W9QWWUM2::Powerful Laptop BUT!  UPDATE::This Laptop is great! The i7 processor is a beast and it has enough RAM to not get bogged down. The GPU is powerful enough to play Modern Warfare 2 and Bad Company 2 with all video controls on high! The only thing that some will find as a con is the size. The ASUS G73 is very thick and bulky but that thickness allows room for its kick butt cooling system! All and all I'm very pleased with my laptop purchase and with all of my dealings with Amazon. I would recommend this laptop to any computer nerd or PC gamer but it may be a little too much machine for a novice.***Update: 6/6/12 Sending my Laptop back to Asus for the 2nd time in 3 months. Something in the GPU or Motherboard has failed two separate times and led to green flashing pixels and an unusable display. Sent it back in April they replaced the motherboard and that lasted for 2 months. So far everything has been ok with Asus Customer Support but this is getting ridiculous. I thought ASUS was a quality brand... I've been using their Motherboards for years. Maybe they are just not as good at notebooks.Reduced from 5 stars to 3... figured 3 was fair since they are fixing it.... If not it would be a 1!Still love Amazon Prime tho!::Arcturus08::3.0::July 13, 2011

R713E5QESBCR0::G73SW-XA1::The only real complaint I have with his computer is the charging plug. It is on the side and can be highly inconvenient. It would be nicer if it was magnetic like the MBP my girlfriend has. It just means I have to be much more careful. Other than that, this computer is amazing. It isn't too heavy and the graphics are stunning. The 8GB of RAM and the option of having 16GB is great! Everything is seamless too! After my girlfriend got a hold of it she instantly wanted one to replace her MBP! And that's really saying something. She just sold her Mac to get one of these today; overnight shipping too!::Brandon Ames::4.0::June 7, 2011
R39E8W9H5RR2SL::Almost Perfect BUT...::I love my new ASUS G73SW=XA! It has so many glorious attributes.  High Rez, Fast Performance, Back Lite and Quiet Keyboard.  There is only one thing I find annoying - it seems to have a disconnect between the keyboard and the touch pad.  It drops the first letter you type in chat windows i.e., Yahoo, Skype and Second Life on-line game.  I read a review AFTER I bought it that talked about this problem.  The Reviewer, the same as I, am hoping at ASUS takes pity on us and offers some kind of update to correct it.  We will see >>>>::F. Davis::4.0::June 6, 2011
R2QB0EESTH5TAM::GREAT LAPTOP BUT STILL WAITING FOR ONE TO WORK::I purchased 4 laptops from Amazon...the XA1 model, the A1 model, 3 were 17 inch and one was 15 inch.  After sending all 4 back here is my take on ASUS and the republic of gamers laptop.  First off none were impacted by the new Sandy Beach processor (at least not that I was able to single out).  The bottom line is either you get a good one or a bad one.  Regardless some things are the same. Frist, yes there is bloatware and no two reivewers have removed it the same way and once you do there are messeage errors that haunt your system.  The lighted keyboard is sometimes working and sometimes not working.  Yes you can reload drivers or press fn and f4 or you can reboot or you can pray but in the end its always something and there are multiple ways to fix the problem however does the solution stick (I am not sure it does).  Yes sleak design and great feel, and packed with a lot of punch and amazing display....but how many times do you have to reinstall the software after you have backed it up for 2 1/2 hrs? I am not going to discuss the weight or size of battery life cause its a gaming laptop and the last 5 reviews have all been on the money.  Asus needs to pay attention to detail and take care of the things mentioned over and over again.  Yes put some things on the back of the laptop so right handed and left handed folks dont have the power cord and other devices in their way.  I believe ASUS has built the best bang for the buck and can do even better by paying atteniton to the words that others have taken time to write.  I will more than likely give this another try and pray the 5th time is a charm.  I have a desk top with ASUS COMPONENTS AND IT ROCKS!!!  ASUS IF YOU ARE LISTENING ...GIVE US BACK UP DISKS ALL READY TO GO...GET RID OF BLOATWARE YOU CAN DO WELL WITHOUT IT (VOLUME SALES).  Hard drives not be divided.....You are kicking ALIENWARE AND OTHERS TO THE CURB. Read carefully the reivewers from AMAZON CUSTOMERS AND YOU WILL GO FAR. As for me, I am going to buy another one and hope this time I get a laptop that works and not one that dies, freezes, sends me error messages when I try to connect to the internet, goes blank after rebooting, lets me play WOW without kicking me off the game on numerous occasions, and last but not least....delivers everything its meant to deliver and more........I will follow up with another review after I get my next laptop.  By the way the 4 laptops were purchased during the month of May.  On another note...Amazon is the best and took great care of me...my hat goes off to them for sending me out laptop after laptop.....Your customer service is the best...THANK YOU AMAZON YOU ARE A CLASS ACT.::Dane Wells "Advocate of Education"::3.0::May 24, 2011
R3EPDQT8XW7IYU::Top Notch Gaming Laptop::Pros:This laptop rocks!Encoding a video, while playing Starcraft at insane video settings says it all!Word 2010 takes 1 second to load.Overall quietLove Full HD. Sound is awsome for a laptop.GTX 1.5GB Video works on everything.Good battery life.Rubberized body, and very unique design.Cons: It is a bit heavy. Had to resize the C partition, as it came with a C and D partition.TONS of bloatware.::oily::5.0::May 24, 2011
R3F9UKKC7RYMM4::Initial thoughts...::Just a quick review on initial thoughts.  I received this computer yesterday and it is very nice.I had been looking at the 15" for myself because it is lighter weight and even that one is very heavy, still trying to decide, however after receiving the 17" for my son, I'm really considering getting one for myself as well.  It is heavy, truly a desktop replacement (that being said it is not as heavy as my original 2004 17" HP that I have and I lugged that thing all over a college campus for 3 years). For reference I'm a 5'0" tall woman.  So if you really want it to be portable, go for it!Display -- WOW!  It is the clearest, crispest display I have EVER looked at!I really like the matte, rubbery feel of the case. Absolutely no fingerprints on this baby!There didn't seem to be as much bloatware as other recent computers I've purchased, but they did pre-load a bunch of game demos, Trend Virus Protection, an MS Office launcher (buy or type in code you already have - I suppose if you already own Office 2010, it would be convenient, but I don't, so I uninstalled it) and some other miscellaneous stuff.I was surprised at the size of the battery, it seems small, but out of necessity, since the fans go on either side of the computer and have ducts running from front to back.  Again, it's supposed to be a desktop replacement, so I'm thinking they assumed most people will have this computer plugged in most of the time.Immediately picked up my network and asked for password, instant internet.Keyboard has small chicklet keys.  I prefer this style keyboard, my Sony Vaio has the same thing and I really like it.  Hardly any noise from keys, nice that it is backlit like my Sony. Doesn't seem to be as much space between the keys as my Sony.  Function keys are much smaller.Silence!!! This thing is so silent, if I wasn't looking at the screen, I would think it was off.  Unbelievable!  So now the question is, if this behemoth of a laptop can be so silent, then why do all my other computers sound like jets taking off and why aren't the manufacturers doing something about that!This is a gift for my son's 15th birthday, needless to say, he loves me dearly today!  He has loaded Minecraft which he said took about 30 seconds (probably exaggeration). He said it is much brighter and smoother than my old XP machine and that ancient HP I mentioned before.  He also loaded Rift (said 1 hour to download)and played that long enough to get the red eyes.  It was gorgeous (my own observation), graphics on this thing are just beautiful.  He just downloaded the trial for Rift on my Sony i7, I can't see much difference in how it runs on mine vs the ASUS, but the display is definitely much better.  Since I have no experience playing Rift, I'm waiting for him to download WoW so I can check that out.  If there is as much difference in display for WoW as for Rift and I can tell differences in the way it runs, I will definitely be considering replacing my desktop with this.::Carmen M.

RXS23M20JJJ0B::Ideal as a Desktop Replacement::I have had the ASUS G73SW for about a month now.  Previously, I owned a Acer AS5672WLMi-ATI X1600 laptop.  The Acer lasted 5 years before the cooling fan failed and the laptop would do a thermal shutdown.  I did a lot of research on laptops until I centered on the G73SW.  The key factors that drew me to it were screen size and resolution, processing capability, overall XA1 configuration, and price.  To date, I have been pleased.The only drawbacks I have seen have been:- lot's of preinstalled software that I don't need and thus removed- the installed camera video quality isn't very good- also, would have liked to see a "shutter" used on it like aus uses on the n53 laptops - blocks camera when not in use- would have liked to have the rj45 network connector on the rear vice left side.- also would have liked to see the power connector on the rear vice the right side- would have liked to have audio connections (mic, headphones on front vice right side)- I don't like the partitioning scheme on the HDD - hidden, os, and data- making the recovery disks took a very long time circa 2.5 hoursThe big positives for me have been- the grpahics capability- the it doesn't get hot - the new sandy bridge processor is great- screen resolution and size is perfect- the backlit keyboard is very helpful- the numeric keypad is very helpful- with the 8 GB ram, fast startup- appears to be very rugged although, I don't plan to move it around too muchoverall, I am very pleased.::Brian F.

RBVWES8WKIA2::G73SW-XA1 is great!::Love this laptop, just received it a day ago, perfect condition, with no problems whatsoever.Pros:-Great deal for amazing specs-Cooling function works terrific-An awesome design (IMO)Cons:-Loaded with junkwares/bloatwares-Doesn't come with recovery disk, you'll need about 6 DVD's -/+R-Quite large and bulky for a 17", not recommended if you're looking for a small laptop/notebookOverall, the laptop works great; Recommended for gamers, and packs one hell of a punch!::Calvin::5.0::April 28, 2011
RTYOZMTHXEJW6::No Backpack and Mouse as of yet, even though advertised::Though I have had issues with G73JW this model is running much better except for the F5 F6 bug and the brightness keys stops working. I could not find a fix at all anywhere, so I just formatted the drive started from scratch.  Installed a fresh copy of Win7X64 and everything seems to be working great, now if I can only get the backpack and gaming mouse the was in the description that this came with is why I picked this model.  Looks I'm not the only one having this problem, Amazon need to step up and correct it and send us was was included, and just because it was removed from the description does not free them from the obligation to there customers.Though I'm a big fan of amazon, so they have been very good about other issues I think they will do the right thing here also.  Hope this helps someone.Amazon has gave me a credit to allow me to buy the backpack and mouse myself for the missing items, so if you had this problem with missing backpack and mouse, just email customer service, they are good about getting back to you quick.::T.

R12K52TEW2VI4K::NEVER BUY AN ASUS PRODUCT!::UPDATE TO THE REVIEW BELOW:After 4 RMA's I am once again having issues with this laptop!  The mouse pad is still not working, which was my original complaint with this machine before the kept returning it to me with more and more issues.  I finally had enough of this!  I called tech support so I could just get the part and repair this thing at my own expense and sell it so I would never have to deal with ASUS ever again.  After waiting on the phone over a half hour at 11:30 at night I get this genius who couldn't even supply me with a part number for their own product!  Her suggestion was to look for it myself!_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:I brought an ASUS g73 laptop less than a year ago. The laptop failed. I sent it to them for warranty repair and they sent it back with a whole new set of issues (missing screws, the keyboard was now defective, and the video was failing). I sent it back to them again, get it back and right out of the box again a new issue (no network card)! I sent it back to them yet again and they sent it back out to the wrong address!Now, I don't even know if my laptop is working or not yet and on top of it it's 100 miles from where I live. I have called them several times, they would keep apologizing and claim they would fix the issue, and then screw it up yet again. I have reached my limits with dealing with these people! They refuse to simply replace the unit with a new one or just refund my money, they even refuse to let me speak with a manager. I have never met people with this level of incompetence in my life!I can't get anyone at ASUS to actually do anything useful, FedEx won't re-route the package because they only let the shipper do it. So I guess I am just supposed to be out my laptop!This is the kind of service you can expect from these people. I guess that is why they have over 1000 complaints listed with the BBB over the last 3 years.::PCGuy72::1.0::April 15, 2011
R3RAGWY06MYOQF::Extremely Dissapointed...::After waiting a long time for the Asus G73SW-XA1 to become available, I finally was able to order it (after Sandy Bridge issue was resolved).  I read a lot of good reviews about this laptop and about Asus in general; overall it seemed like they had great build quality and reliability.  I also owned a few of their motherboards when I built my Desktop, so I was really looking forward in replacing my 5 1/2 year old Dell laptop.However, upon first powering the system on I got nothing but a gray screen and a bunch of lines. I tried restarting numerous times without any luck.  I couldn't easily find a phone number to call at Asus, nor did I feel like going through the whole process they would probably put me through, especially since I just got the laptop. I promptly started the return process with Amazon. Hopefully it goes smoothly and I get a full refund and shipping fees that I paid.This system seemed like an awesome deal, great specs for a great price.  Needless to say it was very disappointing that I didn't even get to use this laptop, but it's better that it failed now then later when it would be hard to get the issue resolved.  This laptop left me with a lot of doubts about the reliability of Asus now and I will probably buy a laptop of a different brand.  Even my 5 1/2 year old Dell laptop hasn't given me trouble yet and is still running strong.Good luck to anyone who already owns this laptop. Anyone considering this laptop should beware. It could have been a fluke that this laptop did not work or it could be a build issue.  As another note, I couldn't get a replacement because it became unavailable shortly after I ordered it (coincident or a sign of issues?).::Jimmy::1.0::March 26, 2011
R4Z3OO1NZXPR9::Screen SO fragile, total insecurity::I bought this ASUS G73J excited about its two year GLOBAL warranty and for its great reviews. However, within the first year of buying the laptop, I have had to send it in 2 times for screen repair. I am not talking about bright-dots. I am talking about TOTAL screen misfunction. It is a tempting buy because of its specs, but PLEASE do not buy this computer. For anyone who depends on it for their work, especially if they travel abroad, their global warranty is false advertising. Repairs are only available at certain centers in the US and in other limited countries, making it almost impossible for users who travel outside of those regions to get service. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND OF COMPUTER. I have had a much worse experience with this brand than with any HP, Toshiba, Mac, Dell or other brand of laptop I have owned.::ASUS user::1.0::September 5, 2011
R3VVJ91QFVMAZ4::Be afraid, be very afraid::Here's the story on the G73JW...If fiddling with the OS is your joy, then this computer is for you. Remember when fiddling with keyboard drivers was fun...well the G73JW will not disappoint. Lost keystrokes, or a frozen keyboard, well, this is the norm, It appears that the keyboard drivers conflict with the touchpad drivers, so you need to make a choice. Which one do you REALLY want? If you turn off the touch pad, then the keyboard works fine. But if you don't, then I hope you are a one finger typist---oh and don't forget the first character you type will be ignored.Do you like crashes - well then you will be in heaven. Frozen cursors mid document are kinda fun, dontcha think? And those buggy USB 3.0 drivers are great. Copy 1 TB of files with USB 2 ports? Not with this computer. Maybe 50GB tops before a freeze-up.  But if you use your single USB 3.0 port, well a crash is only minutes away. And how about that SD card reader? It works with some 8GB cards, but ignores most of the others. But it loves 4GB cards. I guess 2^2 is cool, but 2^3 is not! And for such a powerful CPU, it is just a litle shocking that DVD's burned faster than 2X ALWAYS fail the verify. But hey, no big deal right?Turn on your wifi while ethernet is still plugged in? Oops - crash time.Battery power was touted as 2hrs 45min in the reviews. Actual battery life is less than 60 minutes! And that's in 'sleepy' CPU mode. Are you getting this?Sound drivers are awful. Mondo distortion.Oh and one more thing...Windows 7x64 by itself seems to need at least 30% of your i7 CPU at all times. So if you think this thing is fast, you are mistaken, because the OS is too busy servicing itself to have any time for applications.For those of you that are saying "must be a hardware problem", Linux dispelled that myth. Linux is fast and reliable on the G73, expecially Linux Mint or SuSE...except that if you let it go to sleep, say with a lid close, you can't wake it up.So how do I rate the G73JW? The answer is obvious..the G73JW is alpha, It is feature complete but untested. If you like debugging premium price hardware/software, you will be happy. For everyone else, look elsewhere.Forget the benchmarks, the G73JW belongs in the QA lab, not in consumers' hands.::A.R. Wallace "Al"::1.0::April 22, 2011
R1DCYN3YNYXMUU::Terrible Customer Service (ASUS) & defected laptop::You have to wonder why they train people that no nothing about computers to help you out with your concerns. Luckily I know a thing or two about computers. I have a USB flash drive for my internet and it would not load on this laptop. The lady at customer service told me to contact my internet provider and that the software was the issue. Wrong! I went to the device manager updated the drivers and it loaded fine, however, it should have automatically loaded when put in the USB port. At least it did so on my previous HP laptop. As soon as I got this laptop there were problems, POWER SYSTEM FAILURE appeared after I backed it up and did a system image of the computer. I tried to restore to factory settings but continued to get POWER SYSTEM FAILURE.IT WAS BRAND NEW, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. These computers are defaulted and I suggest to never buy a laptop online. I paid an extra 23 dollars for 2 day shipping and had to send it back the next day for repairs. ASUS, shame on you, your customer service is awful and this laptop is a joke. My orignial HP g71-340US had its issues that had to be repaired, such as the heat sink fan, but never had any problems with a brand new laptop like this ASUS, how pathetic. ASUS, BEST COMPUTER BRAND OUT THERE---I THINK NOT, EXPENSIVE, YES. ALSO AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE ID HAVE TO SAY IS POOR. ID NEVER BUY A LAPTOP FROM THEM AGAIN.::S::1.0::July 14, 2011

R31LOW3KBUEZ5I::A Real Dissapointment::Just purchased this piece of Junk!  The Support for this item is non-existent!  E-mails are ignored, They keep their telephones a secret, good luck trying to connect to their support, I was disconnected from their support several times! Their support people are of no use, all they do is apoligize for their crappy product but don't offer any real help, the last support person I talked to told me to use their web site Good luck with that! Their website is a joke and almost impossible to navigate!  Of all the products out there this one has to be the worst possible one to purchase! This company should just close their doors and go out of business, Also good luck trying to get an extended warrenty The address they sent me to get the accidental damage warrenty does not exist! I was told to go to the web site to find the new address, again good luck after fighting the web site for over an hour I still did not get a new address for the accidential warranty to be sent to for activation. Quite possibly the worst support people in the world, don't buy this item unless you love frustration!::Dan Matteucci::1.0::June 1, 2011
R2KMIBTI01V1X7::Nice laptop but items missing...::I bought the XA1 version a few days ago and the ad included a gaming backpack and a mouse.By now, Amazon removed these items from the ad and sent me nothing, just the laptop.I still waiting for the missing items and the support cant solve my problems!What should I do now?::Matheus Arantes::1.0::March 18, 2011
R2TVTT6S75YR3P::Excellent computer, almost no compromises.::This is a sturdy, fast, dependable, neat professional computer with very few compromises.I get 4 solid hours of battery life while working with large files in graphics programs and connected to the internet all the time. This is how I measure battery life. Measurements with dim brightness and doing almost nothing are nonsense to me.The keyboard layout, tactile feel, touchpad and peripheral ports are all well laid out, strong and functional. Every component works great. The computer creates almost no noise and very little heat after you update the BIOS.Strongest characteristic is that I have used it intensively for 3 months and it has never crashed. The outside appearance is still top notch, thanks to the great quality metal finish all over, with no cheap plastic that starts scratching or disassembling after a few weeks.People tend to look at it and ask the brand name and model, because its clean aesthetics stand out in a world of laptops full of snazzy motives and funny useless gadgets and gizmos.I only have 3 complaints:- The trackpoint falls off. Not sure if I should glue it in place and shut up.- The 1600x900 display is outdated and there is no better display option. It lacks contrast and brightness compared to today's mainstream laptop displays. My eyes suffered initially but I got used to it. Pickier users wouldn't tolerate it and return the computer.- The speakers are cheap garbage. Even my Blackberry sounds better and louder :). Anyway I frequently use headphones, so I tend to forget about this issue.::Joerg von Loebenstein::4.0::August 2, 2011
RXHVUKYEMEBA9::Great buy::Great laptop. Verry Professional, Verry Stable, and Verry Secure. This is a great laptop for anyone who needs to meet that criteria. My whole i.t. firm has one. Network Engineers, Helpdesk, Management, and Sales.It also runs games ok. :-P::Kristopher A. Price::5.0::July 29, 2011
R3CEPBVABE91K1::Love Love Love::I just love my laptop, speedy and wonderful design. Love the aluminum body which definitely helps with the temperature of the machine. Only complaint is with Win7 which did strange things to the headset plug to not disable on board sound.::Charlene Runge::5.0::October 3, 2011
R3AUU0RCHBO11M::Not reccomended if you want to run in 64 bits::I had lot of problems working in 64bits. The laptop always freezes during Windows 7 64 bits installation. I had to return it.I bought a Macbook Pro and I'm very satisfied now.::José Gomez::1.0::November 25, 2013
R3HS4R1BX09Y5F::A near perfect laptop::This laptop has everything you could possibly want as far as tech specs. You got a sandybridge i5, 4 gb of fast ddr3 ram, USB 3.0 slot, hdmi out with hd codec ausio outputs for home theater systems. And the price is a steal of a deal. I got it at 666.02. The price on this thing certainly fluctuates on amazon so patience and a watchful eye on this one will probably get you the best price.Before going to my in depth rants here's a quick sum up for those that don't want to read the whole thingSo to sum it upThe i5 2410M 2.3 ghz with turbo boost to 2.9 ghz and HD 3000 graphics performs well in games and everything else, all at the same time tooThe 4 GB DDR3 1333 does its job while leaving room to upgradeIt has all the desirable features I was looking for such as- 7200 RPM HDD- USB 3.0- i5 sandy bridge- spill proof keyboard- 720P webcam- Great battery life (though I haven't been able to really test that)- Light weight- Win 7 Pro- Num pad keypad- Bluetooth- Wireless N- gigabit ethernet- Light weightIt is amazing, you should buy it. I found most laptops have the same basic specs with 4 gb ram and a i series cpu with a 320-750 Gb 5400 rpm HDD, 15.6" screen, keyboard with keypad, and a built in webcam. Then each brand has there own extras and quirks, like toshiba never seems to have gigabit ethernet it's always 10/100. Asus likes to only have a 640x480 webcam, though they also have a accidental 1 year warranty with their laptops. Those are just a few examples I saw when searching for a laptop. This one is a sneaky little fella out of the main line of hp's consumer lappys that has all that you could want at a more than fair price. I highly recommend itNow for some semi-organized scatter brained rant of a hopefully informative review...The Sandy bridge i5 2410M is awesome. Not sure what the other guy is truly talking about as far as lacking integrated graphics. I do realize that a high end dedicated card will do better but the sandy bridge with the HD 3000 graphics is by far the most impressive on board graphics I have ever seen. For example I have tried running basic games on other laptops with them struggling to run at 640 x 480 with all settings at low. This thing can smoothly run Crysis on medium graphics. I am not a hardcore pc gamer so I haven't tested every game ever but the a few of the ones I have tried mostly just to see how it does are Crysis, Portal 1, Bulletstorm (demo), Half life 2 episode 1, Bioshock 1 & 2, & Mafia 2 (demo). All of which run smoothly at low to medium graphics and look amazing. Mafia 2 is one that runs at the lowest settings and still looks great, of course that game recommends a quad core processor and a high end video card or 2 to run at high settings so with that in mind running it at all is impressive. As well I do light editing for photos that works smoothly, not photoshop or anything of that sort though. As well I watch movies, it plays netflix hd beautifully, though that's not that hard. I have played some 1080p videos out the hdmi that are gorgeous. The windows sound settings claim that the hdmi audio out support all the current HD audio formats. DTS HD Master audio, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby True HD etc. This shows when it's hooked up to my Home Theater Receiver. Sadly I don't have a way to test this because it doesn't come with a program that supports that output. Which is a slight disappointment considering it comes with arcsoft TMT 3. But the digital audio codecs are disabled in the program which makes that player useless. Though the DVD editing software in that bundle isn't so useless.As far as this glorious cpu's speed and power, it is just straight up awesome. Being the techy geek I am I monitor the speed and temps using Speccy. It ranges from 800 mhz per core at idle use to the advertised 2.9 ghz but that's only one core at a time, the other is usually around 2.6-2.7 when the other is at 2.9. Under my normal workload, which is relatively heavy and involves lots of multi-tasking. it boosts to 2.6-2.7 at temps of 60-70 Celsius. Which at first sounded high to me but that's just where these things run. The cool part about that is even when it is 70 Celsius or more in there you don't feel the heat. And of course the 4 gb (single dimm [stick]) 1333 DDR3 ram certainly helps with all that fun stuff as well.Also in the performance category is the 7200 rpm Hard drive. I have found that this is hard to find in main stream laptops in this price range. The majority have 5400 rpm. Trust me when I say that the 7200 makes a difference. And the 500 gb is of course plenty of space.There are of course other fun features such as the 720p webcam, the usb 3.0 slot, the "Spill resistant" keyboard, which I have not and will not test. The keyboard itself is very nice. It has the num keyapd and the buttons press smoothly. The mouse pad takes a bit of getting used to with the multi finger gestures for scrolling and such. But you can play with plenty of settings to turn that on or off and customize it and such. And the fact that it has win 7 PRO instead of just home premium is also a big plus.The bluetooth 3.0 is also great. I have a Bluetooth mouse that connected easily and I continue to have the joy of a wireless and recieverless mouse. I have also synced my phone with the Bluetooth to sync it with outlook and put music on it and the like.The Wireless connection is great. If I had to give a con it's that it only supports 150 mbps. Since it is a combo adapter with the Bluetooth replacing it would lose the Bluetooth. I actually tried putting a intel ultimate n adapter in it, only to find that HP has a very restrictive bios, so be careful when buying upgrades, cross check with hps's site. But I also discovered in that process that the under belly is very easy to get to via the maintenance slider thingy. Can't remember the technical term at the moment, but it has a tool-less entry system to all the user upgradable parts that is next to the battery. Back to the wireless though, regardless of that 150n instead of the more standard 300n it still has a great connection. It also only supports 2.4 ghz, kinda makes me sad to not be able to use the 5 ghz 300 mbps connection from my router but it's a small sacrifice for a constant great signal anywhere in the house or office. I work in a basement office with the router not in optimal position for that and still get a ~70 mbps connection that runs smooth. It speeds test just as fast if not faster than other 300 mbps computers on my network as well. So the wireless connectivity is awesome.The screen is also beautiful, and the speakers are impressive for what they are. It's certainly not audiophile status but it works for quiet music and such.This laptop also is very light weight, barely feels like it adds any weight to my backpack.Also it's shiny and silver. I didn't actually know what color it would be when I got it since there weren't any good pictures, hence why I added some. It looks like there is a better stock picture now though. I'm not one to care about finger prints on the finish but if you do care this one doesn't have that problem.There is a bunch of bloatware, but that is expected with hp type brand computers. Though it isn't all useless. The security program powered by digital persona gives a user friendly set up for the finger print scanner and the face recognition. When using the scanner and face recognition it adds like 10-20 seconds to start up time, which is a bit annoying so I don't use it anymore, but I'm not currently in a environment where heavy security is necessary. When I take it to college in the fall that might change. It also includes drive encryption features, something called evernote, and the arcsoft media suite. It's update software is also nice for the average consumer though I'm still a fan of checking their website manually myself. But the bloatware isn't too hard to get rid of so it's not that big of a deal. I personally have got rid of most of it, but to some it may be useful and worth keeping. Like the other guy said you will also have quite a bit of windows update to get, but that is to be expected with any new computer.So it is all in all practically perfect. The only things I would change is the 150 mbps to a dual band 450 mbps. Thought that was just at first when I found out it only had 150 mbps. Now I don't care so much since it works amazing the way it already is. I highly recommend this laptop or its little brother with the i3-2310M that has just about all the same features.::DarkSideMilk "-Come to the DarkSide we have c...::5.0::June 11, 2011
RWE8I24PN7DEB::hp 4530s::This laptop has all the features that anyone would practically need. The price keeps dropping so any newcomers will definitely benefit from its lowered cost.The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 star treatment were several reasons.cons first1. No instruction manual, download the  HP 4530s pdf ONLINE, I Goggled it.2. No Win 7 Pro Repair disk, available separately for $10 on Amazon or eBay.3. Download Win 7 Pro updates from Microsoft, many and timely but necessary.4. UPS delivered, arrived OK but packing was almost non-existent in a large box. The HP box had enough packing though, so the laptop seemed protected.5. Be prepared for a lot of garbage which can be removed.positives next1. After running setup which was timely, I was impressed with the numerous features and add-ons that came with this model. I compared this HP with several other makes and this laptop excels against similari5-2410s.2. Value for monies paid will surely increase buyers interests obviously.3. This Sandy Bridge make all the previous i5s pale in comparison. My recommendation is to get the i5 with its turbo boost and never look back.4. The newly listed price from Circuit City/Amazon is fantastic for a "Sandy Bridge" i5 laptop.5. The unit seems sturdy enough.6. I like the ease of upgrading the laptop. Flip it over, remove the bottom plates and you can get to the RAM, HDD, etc quite handily.7. The HD+ screen was quite a bonus for these old eyes.8. The offset touchpad was OK.9. The Cap lite is a necessity for me and this unit has one.20. The Intel video with its turbo boost on shared video is supposed to really make a difference, as told to me by a friend who swears by it. We shall see.Overall, I'm looking forward to video editing and doing Photoshop, which were my main reasons on getting this HP.  As to its reliability, time will tell.Footnote, June 7.Runs quite cool and very quiet. No problems so far. May need to get a Vi Dock 4, or better; to boost my integrated video. Seems that the onboard video is a bit lacking and adding an Ati card via the expresscard slot should solve that problem.Footnote, June 15.Discovered HP Documentation earlier when investigating Programs and the PDF was very informative. (Wish there was a note inside the box upon opening)Onboard HD Video is very good for intermediate gaming and video editing. The Crucial 4GB RAM which I added today will handle my multitasking needs quite nicely. Buying and installing the Crucial RAM was most inexpensive method for any upgrade and easy. My PhotoShop and Illustrator applications plus my Sony Suite will benefit highly with this increased RAM.::Mike Phillips::4.0::May 19, 2011
RMQTN9KUQDR0D::great laptop for actual work, terrible integrated software::This is a very thoughtfully engineered and full featured business oriented laptop. Some positive features that set it apart from other second generation sandy bridge core i5 laptops in this price range:An express card 34 slot for high bandwidth peripheralsAn excellent keyboard with numeric padA matte screen finish (thank you!)A generously sized, sensitive and configurable multi-touch trackpad from synaptics with a on/off switchVery easily accessible components and fan ducts to keep dust bunnies under controlThis unit purchased from Amazon comes with a 1 year warranty.After using it for some time, I have some other observations... There are no OS rescue disks included or the ability to burn them yourself. Booting to the OS recovery partition is the only way to restore the computer to the factory state. Needless to say, it is a useless option when your hard disk dies. Also, the image eats up around 16GB! This is totally unacceptable. It was not helpful when swapping in an SSD.The included software is comprised of "special" offer trials for office 2011 and norton internet security, adware, bloated "maintenance" programs, and a "security" suite that poorly duplicates functionality already included with windows 7. There is no unified uninstall for these programs and with the exception of the included Arcsoft media suite and hp power management utility, the only useful function of the included software is to lull the user into a false sense of security. HP, please stop! Expect to spend about 3 hours removing these useless packages.Without the hindrance of the included bloatware and with an SSD equipped, this laptop becomes the weapon of choice for people who like to get some work done on the road. It is sturdy and pleasant to use, with understated design for buttons and non-distracting illumination. The LED back-lit screen has poor resolution (1366x768 ? please.), but is otherwise high-quality. Finally, I cannot say good enough things about the keyboard! Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and I think that you will be too.::binkt::4.0::June 20, 2011
R2M61FXP4F4VX4::Nice laptop::I've had this laptop for about six months now.  I'm reasonably happy with the laptop itself.  I use it for word processing, spreadsheet, downloading photos and editing, and on-line games.  Just routine stuff.  The Windows 7 software takes a little getting used to.  There's a game that my kids like to play where you walk by pressing the directional keys.  If you're walking a long distance and holding the key down for awhile, the computer seems to think that you're telling it that you want it to do something and the game is then messed up.  (I'm convinced that this is my computer's fault, not the game's.)  This is my first experience with W7.::Katie::4.0::May 20, 2012
RYXEUS6U166Q0::Solid machine, Excellent value...::We've had this machine for a couple of weeks now and it's an excellent performer.  Excellent feature set for the money it's really hard to beat.  The ProBook line is oriented towards heavy daily use while still being reasonably priced.  Core i5-2410M processor, 500GB 7200 RPM drive, 4GB RAM, Win7 Pro 64 bit, Webcam, SD card reader, Gigabit LAN, wireless N.  Plus it's got a solid feel.  The display is nice and bright and very clear, but I wish it had more pixels.  1366 x 768 is really limiting so figure on plugging this into a larger monitor for extended home use.  A BluRay drive would have been nice too.It seems that all store bought machines are loaded with trial versions of a lot of different software.  It gets annoying until you get it all out of your way.  I guess that's how they get the cost down.  There was a Microsoft Office shortcut on the desktop.  I entered the serial number from my store bought Office package and it all just worked.  Never had to insert the disk.If you're in the market for a machine in the $650 - $750 range, I'd definitely recommend this one.  You're not out a whole bunch of money but it still feels as though it should hold up for 5 years or so.NOTE: I ordered this from one of the third party suppliers and they shipped me the i3 version poorly packed in a beat up box.  I returned it and ordered one from Amazon and got the correct one in a nice straight box.  Cost me $90 more but it was worth it.  Regardless of who you get it from, check it to be sure you got an i5.  I'm still waiting for my refund.UPDATE: Upgraded rating from 4 to 5 stars.  Yes I had a couple of minor gripes, but at this price point, it's a stellar deal.UPDATE II: Finally received the refund for the i3 machine I returned.  The merchant was Portable Guy and they were responsive to emails and courteous.  They took the time to explain what caused the shipping error.  I'd consider giving them another shot.::J. M.

R196G4D047GFPG::Great Laptop::I love this laptop.  It is fast, the keyboard feels nice, the screen quality is good and I love the number pad.  I don't have any complaints yet!::anknight::5.0::July 20, 2011
R1IVHV3H8P1NEE::HP Probook 4530s XU018UT::This laptop was purchased by me for my nephew who was beginning his graduate studies. I understand from him that it is an excellent laptop with everything he wanted.::Shaker::5.0::September 19, 2011
R8OQO3PNRXMNJ::Excelent value for the money::Purchased an Iconia A501 for ~$550 here at Amazon. It came locked so I decided to stretch for ~$200 more and get a computer.I was comparing this with the HP ProBook 4530s - the big differences were - Docking station, SIM CARD slot and the i5 processor + Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.I have been working with this computer for ~5 months since I have one at work provided by the company.I love it. I have seen it perform very well using multiple resource hungry applications and it is fast.To my surprise, although the SIM card slot is there, when you open it up there is no SIM card reader installed - it is a separate module which could be acquired on eb** for ~$100.This applies only for the HP 8460p XU057UT . There are different part numbers/models (XU057UT) with different specifications and prices. So do your research before purchasingThese were my first impressions. Now in detail:The good:-I love the keyboard and the spacing between the keys.-The touchpad is big and it has a small golden "spot" which if you double tap, it disables the touchpad.-QuickWeb - This computer has a minimal OS built in one of the partitions which means that when the computer is shut down, if you touch the key between the wireless hardware switch and the mute button, it will start the computer with a linux based OS that is very fast and it gives you almost instant access to a web browser and skype. Yes, it allows you to connect wireless - that is how you get online. The quickweb button looks like a globe and in windows will open the default browser.-The aluminium case is nicely built and it feels nice,  looks elegant.-Windows 7 Professional 64 bit edition. You can install xp mode.-Camera is nice and it works fine.-Docking port on the bottom - I am using it with an external monitor and keyboard and occasionally take it with me on the road every now and then. The docking port will set you ~135 off here at amazon-The ability of installing an extra HDD in the Optical Drive bay.-Easy to open cover on the bottom for upgrades using the battery cover-Up to 8 Gigs of memory easy to install.Almost forgot to mention - this thing comes with a western digital 320 gb so if you plan on installing an SSD - my work computer has an SSD and the difference is huge.- so the software that comes with windows which you'd use to create a system image asks you for a hard drive equal in size or larger - an ssd 300 GB is ~$ 600 and up Or you can get a retail windows license and a smaller SSD. Probably System Builder disk/OEM win 7 would do you fine. note to note - if you install windows 7 from scratch or you format the hard drive and remove the partitions, you will lose the quickweb feature as it resides in the partition _HP Tools.-Comes with a lot bundled software - some of it useful some not so, depends on your needs - you can uninstall the one you do not need. I like the hard disk encryption and fingerprint reader plus the HP assistant will update all the drivers for you.-Counterstrike Source is playable with the integrated HD3000 Intel graphics if you lower the graphic settings. This does not mean you can get it for gaming. You can do very very light gaming.And the fan will start screaming and the laptop  will get warmer - not really hot on the right upper side of the keyboard where the chipset and processor are.-Sandybridge implementation: This baby has USB 3.0 ports. 3 of them and an esata port.-Has a DVD writer combo which is fine - the usual.-Onboard sound is ok.The bad:-The touchpad keys look like they are not lining up perfectly.-The screen is not so great but on the other hand is a matte screen.-The keyboard light does not provide enough light for you to see all the keys. Not a big deal to me as I touch type.-I still can't get over the fact that HP did not include some useful disk creation software that would not have this limitation(equal or larger HDD). Or create the installation disks for the OS.You get disks with the drivers and software they provide. Not the OS disc.I hope this review is useful to you. If you have any questions, post a comment and I will get back to you.::SnowBreeze "Tefi"::5.0::November 6, 2011
R21CX6JRN98V9G::solidly built::Looks about the same as older elitebooks.  Hinges are not as noticeable.Improvements are many:1) I5 runs cool and quiet.  Didn't gotten hot on my lap even during installation of MS Office 10.2) Solidly built. The area below your palms doesn't flex and nor does it flex if you hold the laptop from the corner.3) Easy access panel to memory, hard drive, for upgrade, maintenance, and cleaning.4) Decent battery life.  Not as good as apple but getting there.  Runs for 4-6 hours on standard battery.5) Bigger mousepad.Complaints:1) Larger mousepad gets in the way of typing sometimes.2) Continues to run when laptop is left unattended. Waste of battery.3) A little on the heavy side, although expected with more metal parts.4) Buttons have a little more travel than desired, especially the mouse buttons.Best laptop so far.  Looks like this one will last for a while.::SDDK52::5.0::June 30, 2011
R2MOIRHV6UTL0I::In love with this computer.::Love this computer.  The form factor is beautiful!  The keyboard redesign (over previous models) is perfection.  The brushed metal finish is wonderful and doesn't pick up fingerprints.  The the trackpad is wonderful as well (bigger than most other computers).  It does feel fairly hefty/rugged, but it gives it a very sturdy feel (just not as sleek as some of the pictures make it look).The fingerprint scanner works like a charm.::quinnj::5.0::August 17, 2011
R3SJOJWXEDX815::Great Corporate Laptop::I have used many HP EliteBook's over the years and this is by far the best in the line. The 6930's were a joke and the 8440's made huge improvements but the 8460 definitely is the winner. Excellent battery life, solid processing performance and versatility make this a great machine to have. The island keyboard is by all means they way to go. Old EliteBook's could easily have keys ripped off by simply wiping the dust off. In the office I use mine in a docking station with dual 22in monitors and a wireless keyboard and mouse. At home its attached to a since 22in monitor, no docking station and just a wireless mouse. As a network engineer it gets the job done every time. With no bloatware or add ons they are pretty much ready to go out of the box.Pro's: Reliable, stable, good warrant, docking station capable simplicity of use.Cons: Its heavy.::Matt P.::5.0::March 29, 2013
R3K3SREOHPUV53::Pretty good laptop::This laptop was a pretty good price for what it includes.Pros: A light for the keyboard (though it is pretty dim), matte screen, mine included Windows 7 which I love and Microsoft Office (not sure they all come with this though). Very sturdy. Lots of metal parts. Nice web cam.Cons: The scratchpad is bulky and doesn't always cooperate (it likes to make the screen zoom in and out when you don't want it to). The laptop is very heavy and a little thick. No HDMI port... my 3 year old cheaper laptop included an HDMI port!  USB ports are hard to use. It is hard to open the CD drive because of the location of the button on a slanted curve. You pretty much have to pick the laptop up to open the CD drive. A backlit keyboard would have been nice... the light doesn't help much at all.::MM::4.0::November 25, 2012
R20BX9C31O8XFJ::HP EliteBook 8460P::Excellent fit and finish. Solid feel, not loaded down with bloatware. Excellent features: CAC reader (a plus for Military users) solid keyboard, removable back for upgrades, turn on/off  switch glidepad, biometerics, usb port, spillproff keyboard, etc. Runs very nice with Win7 x64 and 4 meg. I have ordered 4meg chip to bring up to 8meg, should improve speed. Only complaints are edge on front bezel (a bit sharp) and screen could be touch better (sharper/brighter). For the price this laptop is a hit for HP, quality compares nicely to Thinkpad I used to have.::Tom::5.0::March 23, 2012
R3PGSXC8O3VU8C::HORRIBLE keyboard::If you value a good keyboard and usability, DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP!I don't disagree with the specs and performance ratings other reviewers have posted -- the machine is relatively fast and durable.  However, HP really dropped the ball when it comes to usability with this laptop's design.KEYBOARD:HP put so much attention on creating a keyboard that fit a grid, that they totally ignored usability.  One of the key principles of design is to "chunk" things to make them easier to identify/remember/etc.  That's why phone numbers and social security numbers have hyphens in them; it's easier to remember three chunks of small numbers than one large number.  This is also why for as long as keyboards had function keys (F1 - F12), there were groups of four keys with a space between them.  This keyboard, however, has every single key right next to each other, violating the principle of chunking.  There's no space between the [Esc] and [F1], [F4] and [F5], or even between the arrow keys and the [Ctrl] key.  Everything is jammed into a grid, making it VERY difficult to feel for keys.  I've always touch-typed and now find myself having to look at the keyboard to read labels on keys.The arrow keys are laid out across three cells on the "grid", with the Up and Down keys jammed into a single cell -- that's right, the Up and Down are only half-size, jammed together in the space for a single key.  However, the Left and Right arrow keys are full-sized with a space between them and the Up/Down keys.  It's just plain AWKWARD!Typing on this reminds me of typing on an iPad -- it's okay for short messages, but you wouldn't want to write a book on it.CHASSIS:The chassis does seem durable and has a nice metal feel to it.  However, they did away with the rounded-over front edge below the keyboard.  So, type on it for a while and your wrists will have little sore marks from the sharp edge of the chassis.INDICATOR LIGHTS:I think HP swung the pendulum WAY too far to the other side with addressing customer feedback on LED indicator lights.  If you saw the predecessors to this laptop (the HP 8440P, etc.), you'd know that one of the customer complaints was the insanely bright LED indicator lights -- they would blind you while using the laptop.  So, HP took customer feedback and went to the other extreme!  The indicator lights ARE NOT VISIBLE!The indicator lights (power, HDD, WiFi, charge) are TINY little pinholes with tiny LED's behind them.  They are smaller than 0.5 mm!  The only way to see them is to position yourself directly inline with the LED and stare into the pinholes.  ABSOLUTELY USELESS!!!TOUCHPAD: (The only good thing)The touchpad is the only thing that seems to be done well.  It is over-sized (4"x2"), supports gestures (two fingers cause scroll, etc.), and can be easily disabled.  If you double-tap the tiny dot on the top-left corner of the touchpad, it disables the touchpad.  If you double-tap again, it re-enables it.  Also, your thumb won't affect the touchpad -- if you rest your thumb or slide it across the touchpad, the touchpad ignores it.  Nice for people who hate touchpads because of accidental movement with resting thumbs.  VERY NICELY DONE.SCREEN:The screen has a strong blueish-green cast to it without a lot of color fidelity.  I had to go into advanced settings and adjust the gamma settings to .7 and other color settings to get the right color fidelity.::X_HOBBES::1.0::June 1, 2012
RU7A2B6TGCVM4::Very sturdy!::I was looking for a durable laptop, with a comfortable keyboard, and a matte screen. This laptop has it all! I spend hours on my laptop writing. This laptop does not hurt my eyes or my fingers. Its not the most modern looking laptop, but it is super sturdy. Its fast and the price was right. In fact, it was under my budget so I bought myself a new camera. I wish it had a backlit keyboard, but that wasn't a must. Overall, I am very pleased with the laptop.::remoteisland::5.0::March 10, 2012
R3UD8JEXQWRXK8::Good unit, but need something beefier::For a business notebook that's used to being driven down from heavy use and passed down over layers of management, this unit is surprisingly resilient!  But with today's applications, you might seek something beefier if you planning on running alot of programs.I am big on the feel of a notebook, and its design is nice.  Before this I had a Vista era Dell, and it felt plasticky and creekier than the inspiron I had had several years before it.  This has a brushed aluminum finish, which just feels more solid, which business users will appreciate, even if it's just in your head.  And I think you'll find it's not all just in your head.  It's been built around a lightweight metal skeleton that lends it rigidity and durability. If you believe HP's product testers, the 8440p should survive repeated drops from 30 inches, heat up to 160 degrees, dust, humidity, and up to 300 pounds of weight on the lid.  And get this, the keyboard even has a drain in the bottom to funnel spilled drinks away from the electronics and straight through the bottom. Everyone spills drinks, but I think it's safe to assume business users are even more prone, what with our lattes and limited desk spaces.This unit really excels at how many ports it has.  Besides the usual three USB ports, you'll find an additional eSATA/USB for faster devices, a FireWire port for compatibility with many Mac-centric accessories, an ExpressCard port for upgrades, an Ethernet jack and even a modem, god forbid. It has SD and other formatted cards, which many peripherals are doing these days. The front includes a standard SD/MMC card reader, and you'll find both analog VGA and digital DisplayPort outputs on the back for video.One cool little thing is an LED light above the monitor for nighttime situations.  It might not be the most powerful, but it does the job, and it's easy to find.  On other models that have an LED lit keyboard, you often have to locate it in the dark, to turn it on.  Which sort of defeats the purpose.The unit has both a traditional trackpad and the less popular "nub" buried in the center of the keyboard. Whenever possible I use a traditional mouse because of my role is very graphic/visual in nature, and I don't have time to mess with a trackpad.  It is multi-touch which makes scrolling so much easier when I need to though.Mine did not come with a webcam, so I can't speak to it, although I've read some reviews that have said the model on this one is exceptional, and doesn't look like the typical creepy guy broadcasting from another planet over dial-up.The 14.0-inch LCD on the EliteBook comes in a 1366 x 768 resolution - about average. It has a matte finish versus a glossy, so although not quite as bright and vibrant (but hey, it's a work machine), it delivers better overall usability in a variety of situations like offices to park benches, trains and airplanes. Best of all, it cranes 180 degrees.This unit comes equipped with an Intel Core i5 2.4GHz CPU, and while one day there was probably little that made it pause, I've found that by the software standards of today, I seem to start getting lag if I keep it powered on for a couple days.  I'm a graphics and web designer, so it's not uncommon for me to have Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Illustrator and Fireworks CS6 all open at the same time, in addition to the usual IE, word and excel.  It's safe to say I don't bloat it with cookies and registry modifications as I mostly use it at work.  So if you do purchase this model you might invest in extra memory.The Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD rather than a discrete GPU from Nvidia or ATI inside, it's nothing to hem and haw about, but as a work machine, it really doesn't need to be.  Even though I do what I do, I'm not typically doing anything "motion" related, so it's fine.One good thing is, this unit is largely ready to go out of the box, and free of bloatware.  Even alot of HP's own additions, which I've struggled with in the past with printers and camera's, have been filed away in a folder named HP.  Another handy feature is HP's Power Assistant utility. It makes it easy to uncheck extras like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth from one central control panel, and tells you how much you'll save with different settings. For example, did you know that switching off Wi-Fi only saves about a tenth of a watt, for instance, while jumping from "mobile" to "high performance" will rack on nearly an extra five. Still, it easily will shut off such features for you which I find alot easier than Windows' increasingly complex Control Panel.HP advertises battery life of up to six hours and 30 minutes, but I've never gotten that. Usually I'm lucky to stretch battery life over four hours, and with high performance, you're looking at more like three. Chances are the typical user isn't going to be away from a wall outlet that long, but I could see some international flights posing a problem.Not surprisingly, the speakers aren't that great.  But unless you're in your hotel room unpacking or cooking, you have no business using laptop speakers to listen to music anyway; you should be connecting it to a receiver or headphones.There are a couple other perks, like a fingerprint reader, and I always love HP's decision to have backlit icons next to the keyboard showing you  which options are activated, such as caps lock, wifi, and speaker controls.::kylejpatrick::3.0::December 3, 2012
RNEU110DEGOKS::Update sep-24-2012:  Adding one more star for fixes.::Update sep-24-2012:  Adding one more star for fixes.Some of the issues I originally had have not manifested for many months now.  Specifically I have not had any lockups on keyboard or mouse or mousepad.  Indeed I was able to have my people turn off the mouse pad (at least partially anyway) so it no longer interferes with my typing and editing of code.  I know my company has been downloading updates furiously over this time period.  I can only guess that some of these updates have fixed the issues I no longer have.  I still cannot get the sound to work correctly to mute the onboard mic but it does now appear to recognize when a headset or phones have been plugged in or removed and set its internal control settings properly which is an improvement.So overall, things are getting better.  That to me means +1 since this seems to be a product with some support over time.  A good thing if you are using it for businesss work.  Again good job HP.  What a surprise from a company that at one point had said it was remping down its participation in the laptop market.Update jan-20-2012:  Adding one star for durabilityI just dropped it.  More precisely as I walked away from my desk, my foot caught on a cord and pulled the laptop off my desk and onto a hard wooden floor.  This is a four foot drop.  The thing was on its face open; but the thump when it hit the floor was somwhat muted (although what do I know, this was the first time I ever dropped a laptop).  Knowing what I have seen from other people's laptops when they have dropped them I expected cracked screen or dead laptop, or non-functional keyboard and the like.BUT NOPE.  this thing is acting like nothing happened.  Sceen is fine, keyboard is fine, mouse is fine.  I will be checking all components thoughout the day as I use them but so far all is well.  This impresses me greatly.  I guess they really did harden this version of the laptop.  For this reason, this laptop would be good for those who are prone to bumping and dropping (students) and so I up the rating one star.  Good job on the hardening HP.-----------------------------------------------------------------Original Post:  Disappointment for three straight monthsI got the 8460p as part of an upgrade process at work where we upgraded all laptops over a certain age.  So far I have had nothing but trouble and see little of value.  Here are my complaints.1) I5 speed, not... it is slower than the laptop it is replacing.2) I5 multi-tasking.  Nope, not seeing that either.  Example: apps are slow to launch and you can't do anything till they finish launching.3) keyboard, most keys are fine for typing, but some dummy designer decided it was a good idea to put a special function key on the lower rung getting it to fit by making the up/down arrow keys be half size.  Not very good for someone who writes computer code and thus does some heavy text editing.4) keyboard.  Once a week this keyboard completely locks up.  The only solution is to turn off the computer and then turn it back on.5) mouse pad, like most mouse pads stink.  This one continuously interfers with editing causing the mouse to jump to unknown places in a document.6) audio.  The sound system has multiple problems.  It sometimes goes out just like the keyboard with the same solution of off/on (not restart, actual off/on).  Also, the audio won't keep its settings for my mic.  It keeps reverting back to the onboard mic forcing me to continuously have to reset the audio to use my headset mic.  This is a real bother for us remote workers who rely on teleconferencing to attend meetings.7) Screen.  The screen is very hash on the eyes.  No amount of fiddling with screen settings has helped either.If I had my choice, I'd ask for my old laptop back.  Too bad, I was looking forward to a faster more versatile machine.  Guess I'll have to keep calling the help desk till they get tired of me.  I wonder who decided on this machine for a corporate standard and why?  I am told by my buddies in tech support that I am not the only one with problems.Hail Flavius!::Kevin Meade::4.0::December 22, 2011

RTZOIUXWAREVU::No frills but can't beat the price!::My old trusty HP running XP finally threw in the towel. Not a gamer or heavy graphics user so all out power is not necessary...just reliable basic web access and computing...and the occasional DVD/Movie.First off, you can tell this case is used for more than one machine as the HDMI output is blocked off.  Custom it is not. While the keyboard layout is pretty good it does have some "give" which gives it a less than solid feel. The touchpad is quite sensitive and I found myself accidentally having the cursor go haywire. I now disable it when using a mouse.  I do like the dedicated number pad but find it interesting there is no volume control...only on screen.4 USB ports is a bonus plus the built in web cam...something not found on many of the bargain units.  The battery charges very fast and in heavy/constant use I have been getting 2.5+ hours.Speed is fair and likely with a bump in the memory it will increase a bit.  Fortunately you can upgrade up to 8 gig.Not much else to say yet...but if all you need is a basic machine for less than $350 this could be your ticket.::Amazon Customer "SV Rider"::4.0::May 19, 2011

I need it only for single things to do.The best part is it is a really lightweight.Otherwise it is a normally LaptopI found only two very bad pointsOne is the option to recognize your fingerprint. It works very bad. You have to move your finger a lot of times over the sensor before it recognize it.The second and worst point is the option to recognize by camera. Forget it. If you use this option the windows never booted correctly and I needed a lot of attempts to start the system. Then I deleted the driver and since this time I didn't have anymore problems with this Laptop. Overall it is not bad. My friend said if you buy a computer for $ 4000, you get it. If you buy it for $ 350 you get it too. It's a device for people like I not for professionals::Petra Hoffmann::4.0::August 30, 2011
REOIBVGKG5KRX::Disappointing - Look Elsewhere::I at first thought this was a great value.  Lenovo has an excellent reputation and the price was great.  After using the machine now for 5 months, I have found I made a mistake in purchasing this laptop and wish I could return it.  I am having issues connecting to the internet.  Windows 7 is dropping the wireless connection ever 20 - 30 seconds and reconnecting.  This causes pages not found which I have to reload and dropped videos.  Since the main purpose of using this machine is to surf the internet (it is not very powerful and was purchased for that purpose), this is disappointing.  I have also run into issues with reading some DVDs, though it will read others.  Same disks have no issues on any other machine I've tried.Is the fault of all this Lenovo's or Microsoft's?  No idea.  And as far as I am concerned it does not matter.  Lenovo should have tested this system better and made it sure it worked correctly.  The DVD drive should work with the disks used.  Is the drive going?  Again no idea.  I can't tell when it started having this issue since I did not test DVDs until recently, but again, poor quality.I have not given up on getting the system to work and will most likely try another operating system, but it has hurt my opinion about the quality of Lenovos.I suggest you look for something else.EDIT - 12/8/2011After playing around with different options, I have found gotten the wireless not to disconnect (though I don't know if it is a permenant fix).  I also found the issue with the unreadable DVDs (long folder name in a subfolder - though Windows XP had no problems).  So is the issue Windows 7 is more finicky and I should not be blaming Lenovo?  I tend to group the computer and OS together unless I planned on using another OS.  In any case, with the problems (at least for now fixed), I feel comfortable updating the rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.  Why not 4 or more?  Because:A brand new system really should not be giving me issues that every other device connected to my wireless do not.  A brand new system should not give me issues with DVDs that an older OS has no problems with.  Finally, I did try to run Linux from a bootable CD and it did not run well (so this computer is not non-Windows friendly).  For all that, I'll do 3 stars.::Steve::3.0::December 5, 2011

R21Y42GSRZ2UFE::A Good All Around Laptop::This laptop has been reliable and quiet in the 4 years I've owned it. In the past year I bought 4GB of RAM, a new Solid State Hard Drive and installed Windows 7 64-bit. Things seemed great but when I would push the laptop to play video games on High Performance it now has trouble holding a steady FPS (Frames Per Second). In other words, games which did work are barely running and they lag too much that gaming is unenjoyable. These are games made around 2009 to 2010. It seems Intel's HD Graphics gets worn out and will lose its horsepower. Other than that, for the price it's a great laptop to own! It was just frustrating to be involved in a game and find out it can't play anymore. It's time to upgrade to a better system.::LostSoul::3.0::June 1, 2013
R1MJWV6WDLLQFM::DO NOT BUY (Please facebook before you waste your money)::For the record: I took  very good care of my laptop. It never left my cooling desk.I dont have money to waste so I take pride in taking care of my electronics.  Please do not by any products from this company.I have this computer sitting in my closet and its only 2 years old.  From the moment I purcahsed this laptop there has been problem after problem. I had to take the very first one back to best buy and they exchanged it for another one. First it was the grinding noises and it takes for every to start. Twice the computer goes dead with no power. The first time it went out I sent it back to the company on my dime and within 7 months later this computer went dead again with the same problem. Customer service is the worst I have ever experience It took them two months to even respond to my complaint about my laptop. They refused to fix my laptop unless I pay for it out of pocket even thou they did not appearing fix it because it was only 7 months later.  Their facebook page is full of complaints please view it before you buy anything Lenovo::Latoya::1.0::February 26, 2013
R17JO5KCTRV7FV::Beyond Great !::I was looking for a great laptop that would be able to respond to all my digital needs and hopefully I found this.With a 6GB RAM, this laptop can handle everything you could simultaneously. You will love the the extra light weight, you barely feel anything on your lap.SRS Premium Sound integrated gives you a complete personalization of your sound quality. As on the description, you have a 640GB Hardrive that will hold all your musics, videos, games, movies, etc...I also found the Intel Turbo Boost Technology very handy when it comes to run heavy programs at the same time, it gives you that extra boost(up to 3Ghz)when you need it.Bluetooth also integrated (couldn't ask for more). Battery life is pretty decent for a Windows laptop(up to 4hrs on Balanced power plan).Sleek and professional design.Webcam can deliver HD videos which is simply amazing.Finally, the processor is so "robust" that even when you have many programs running at the same time, your CPU usage is usually less than 20%.Great value for the price, would greatly recommend it to laptop buyers.::Reynaldo::5.0::September 9, 2011
R31YIHG6PMAOI5::Great machine::I bought this machine from Amazon in early April 2011, so I've been using it for nearly 3 months. I'm a software developer.It is a great machine with a few minor negatives. First the negatives:1) Even with the docking station (highly recommended) it will drive only two external monitors, for a total of three if you count the internal screen.I don't consider this a fatal flaw, as I use a Displaylink device to drive a third big monitor2) You don't get RAID on this model - if that matters any more3) Yes, it could use an SSD drive, but that would add a lot to the pricePositives:1) Very fast processor. It typically runs all four cores at 3 Ghz and can run a single core at as high as 3.3 Ghz2) Expandable: I immediately put in 8 more GB of RAM for 16 GB total. Note - I had to remove the keyboard to get to one of the extra RAM slots - no big deal  It also has an Ultrabay - be sure to get the $60 hard disk adapter - and I threw in another 500GB 7200RPM drive.3) It has 2 USB 3 ports, as well as 1 eSATA/USB combo powered port. This means I can boot from an external 2.5 " hard drive via a special cable (sold on Amazon).4) It has an mSATA slot for an internal WAN modem OR Micro SSD card - nice!5) The screen is high resolution and very bright LED back lit. I can easily see it outdoors6) Rugged, durable build. Good thermal design - runs cool.7) Three year warranty  There are many more positives, but suffice to say that this is a great, not perfect, but a great machine.::Dan::5.0::June 22, 2011
R2OU8WR6M04LU5::Lenovo W520: a monster machine with few cons and lot of pros::I recently purchased this laptop as my photo editing portable workstation and would like to share with you some of my opinions even if maybe it's still early since less than 2 weeks passed by.CPU: very very fast, you can really tell the difference from older PCs, Canon 5D Mark II 21 Mpixel RAW files rendering was almost on the fly.RAM: 8GB seems enough but there's still plenty of space for expansion up to 32GB which probably I'll do once the prices drop down.HDD: think this is probably the only bottleneck (or at lest this is what I understand using the Windows index). There's still the possibility to add an SSD.Nvidia Quadro 1000M 2GB: still have to test it with some 3D applications, Optimus seems to work well under Windows, still have to find a way to use it under Linux though.Fingerprint reader: really nice, it even allows you to turn on the computer and login automatically swiping your finger just once. (I didn't manage to make it work on Linux yet but maybe there's a workaround)Camera: seems quite good also in low light situations.Speakers: they seem quite low, but apparently it should be something related to drivers or internal settings and not physical limitations since on Linux or VLC I can boost up the volume over 100%.USB ports: nice to have 4 of them, but it would have been nice also to have some of them on the right side since 3 of them are placed on the left and one on the back.Color Calibrator: I've found out sadly it's not present in this specific model, but it is as an option.Keyboard: comfortable enough but not as good as the Sony Vaio, weird position for the Fn (swappable with Ctrl key from BIOS) and Del keys.I'd also like to replace it with the Italian keyboard but I don't know where I should get the replacement part nor the price.The screen looks AWESOME and it's very good it has 15 levels of brightness so it can be extremely dim for the night or very bright for viewing under sunlight.I haven't tried the Display Port since I have no device to connect it to at the moment.Thermal design:it is absolutely the coolest laptop I've ever had.170W Power adapter: a HUGE and HEAVY brick but it does its job, just wish they could build a smaller one.The top cover of the screen is covered with a weird material which easily collects dust.Battery life: still have to test it in a better way since I've been using this PC mostly at home, but when I took it with me out I have to say it surely lasted WAY longer than any other laptop I've ever had even if it is so way much powerful.Overall I'd really recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a mobile workstation to work with graphic and photo/video editing or in any case for a laptop with a very good processing power and long lasting battery life in a 15.6" form factor.::Gabriele::5.0::August 23, 2011
R3VPE14RS50YF8::one hell of a machine::Not much more to say what the first reviewer hasnt already mentioned.I used a Macbook Pro until now (which had - after < 2 years of use - enough bugs for 3 laptops - fan out of control, cd/dvd drive broken, etc.), and I dont regret switching to the W520 (I own a W520 for a month now). I am doing a lot of Matlab image processing on my laptop, and the performance as well as screen resolution / quality is great (upon purchase, Lenovo lets you choose between 3 different screens with different maximum resolutions - i chose the highest resolution - 1920 X 1080; also they let you choose between 2 different gpus). One unique thing to mention is that you have full control over which graphics processor (integrated vs. Nvidia gpu) your laptop uses when, and for which application separately - i think this is kind of new and unique.The only thing that bothered me initially was Lenovo's trackpad, which doesnt come close to the comfort of my Macbook pad. Normal cursor control is ok, but e.g. two-finger scrolling is almost impossible. After my initial disappointment,  I got really hooked to using the red lenovo track point. It takes one to two days to get used to it, but once you have the hang of it, it's much more convenient for cursor control, scrolling (instead of 2 - finger scrolling, one uses the middle button above the trackpad), etc. than the track pad. So - no complaints there. And if you want to do e.g. technical drawing, you may want to use a mouse in any case...One thing more that took me a bit of patience to figure out was the fact that - by default - the operating system shuts down and 'unmounts' the physical cd drive when not in use. This is a good feature as it helps saving energy. However, it interferes with the installation and usage of virtual drives (e.g. Daemon tools). Anyway, I figured out that you can easily disable this CD drive - auto-shutdown option. So - if you have the money - stop looking. This is your machine.::georg::5.0::July 26, 2011
R3GQOEJ7XWR9ZQ::When it works it's great, but when it doesn't...::I purchased a W520 after researching quite a few laptops.  On paper, this laptop has it all...powerful processor, 4 dimm slots and support for 32gb memory, good discrete graphics options, excellent display, great battery.  You name it, this laptop has it.That said, I believe Lenovo is skimping on parts, QA, or engineering (perhaps all of the above).  I have owned this laptop for little over a month and already run into two nasty defects:- First, the speakers on the laptop work intermittently.  It turns out the speaker wires are routed directly over the cpu/gpu heatsink and have no heat shrink protecting them.  When the proc and gpu are going full tilt, the heatsink melts the coating on the wires and they short-out.  Thankfully someone posted excellent info on the matter at [...].  What I find annoying is this problem was first reported in May 2011 [...] and W520s are still being shipped without heat shrink protecting the speaker wires.  My laptop was assembled in February 2012.  Eight months after the problem was reported, my laptop shipped with a known and easily addressable defect.- Second, my W520 suffers from the 'sudden shutdown syndrome'.  This is a problem in which the laptop will shutdown and reboot sporadically once or twice a day...no BSOD or any other diagnostics.  It behaves as if someone yanks the power suddenly.  This problem was first reported in June 2011 and has gone unresolved since.  There are over 100 pages of forum posts dedicated to it on the Lenovo Support forums:[...]Certainly both of these problems may be addressed by replacement hardware.  What irks me is that this is Lenovo's top-of-the-line, flagship laptop, and it seems they don't care if they are shipped with defects.  I would be less upset if they put genuine effort into identifying the design flaws, replacing existing flawed parts, *and shipping updated/fixed laptops*.  Instead, they are still shipping flawed laptops and are putting minimal effort into isolating the design flaws.  Yes, a Lenovo staffer pops onto the forum every now and again and says they are working on it, but it wreaks of minimal PR / damage control.  If they were genuinely serious about addressing the defects, they would ship a tested, functioning replacement laptop to those affected, and send all of the faulty laptops directly to engineering for analysis.  Instead they have cherry-picked one laptop at a time, and often these have been the laptops that shutdown sporadically once every week or so.  My own laptop shuts down once or twice a day.  I coordinated with a Lenovo employee, offering to send it directly to their engineering team for diagnosis.  I made the offer two weeks ago, have followed-up multiple times, and still they have not taken the laptop.  Simply put, they hardly care about addressing the issue.I know this likely comes down to a business decision on Lenovo's end.  If design flaws only affect 1-2% of their shipped laptops, perhaps they feel it isn't worth the effort to diagnose.  Personally, I prefer companies that prioritize their customers' satisfaction.  For that reason, this will be my last Lenovo purchase.  I would advise others to stay away as well.::Robert Ziuchkovski::2.0::April 6, 2012
RM93XBY4Q3SU9::w520::All in all a great laptop.

RN6BT2TOF2ERT::Rubbish::I chose Lenovo because of the good name that comes with the ThinkPad legacy. Reviews at the time (about 18 months ago) were very positive and editorial reviews don't tend to focus on build quality much because it's hard to measure.I have come to hate this machine. It does have some positives, which I will include for the sake of fairness. But it is filled with so many hardware / driver bugs that I just want to throw it out the window. Here is a list of the ones I can think off the top of my head that drive me crazy. Ready?- Sometimes it chooses not to sleep when I close the lid or explicitly ask it to (yes I've configured Windows 7 to sleep on lid close). Sometimes I hear it wake up (it beeps) in the middle of the night, then go back to sleep again, often more than once. While the lid is closed!- The built-in microphone doesn't work. The sophisticated dual-head technology for noise cancellation effectively cancels me out with it, no matter how far or close I speak from it. The other party can hear something, sometimes better than others, but it is just terrible quality. I often hang up VoIP calls in frustration and reach for my USB headset.- USB slots fail every other week. My USB mouse is dead when that happens. Rebooting fixes it.- Turning the WiFi switch off and back on causes Windows to lose the setting to automatically connect to my WiFi networks.- The screen brightness adjustment keystrokes (Fn-Home, Fn-End) do not work about once a week. A reboot fixes it.- The mute light, while a good idea, sometimes goes out of sync with the actual Windows mute state- The mouse wheel scroll speed resets to 1 line per wheel tick about once a week.  Merely opening the Mouse dialog in Control Panel fixes it.I have attempted driver upgrades which have either not helped or temporarily improved the situation until another driver update cancelled them out.Furthermore, it suffers from general poor design- Poor speaker quality- Putting the "back" and "forward" browser buttons right next to the cursor keys is disastrous. I discovered this after I spent 20 minutes typing in a web textbox. I wanted to move the cursor to make some final edits and hit the back key by accident instead. Lost all my work. I have since remapped those keys to something else and learned my lesson to never write long responses in a browser directly.- The Fn key is where the Ctrl key is typically. It took me about a year of pressing Fn when I meant Ctrl.- It doesn't have a mic jack; only headphones- It weighs like a brick (but it gives good battery life in return)I do want to state a few positives, which earn it its second star:- Performance is great- It absorbs water spills like a champion. It is designed to be water resistant, with dedicated drain holes that safely guide the water from top out through the bottom.- Great screen. Crisp, with a dark black and great contrast- I like the feel of the touchpad. It doesn't get slick from oil residue due a grid of micro bumps and a matte material- Good keyboard response. It has the right balance of softness and resistance- Mute lights (for mic and speakers)In general though, I'm appalled at the sheer number of defects which makes me question Lenovo's commitment to build quality. I will be trying a different brand for my next laptop and hope that there is still a good quality machine being made.::Steven Nicolaou::2.0::August 27, 2012
R31UJN8ZFSXNOR::Great multi use notebook::I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. It's very versatile, it does everything she has loaded flawlessly.Pro's: its fast with photo rendering in Lighthouse, of course any business application, video editing. web surfing, Itunes a few games, you name it. The screen is bright and the key board set up is great.Con's: my one complaint is that when I bought it, in the description it said it had a lite keyboard, the only thing my wife said she really wanted. Well it is lit, with an LED that sits on the top edge of the display. It shines down on the keyboard, it ISN'T repeat ISN'T back lit. However the screen is so bright that my wife doesn't need it lit,so it all good. All in all it a very good multi use notebook.::K. merrill "mechman76"::5.0::January 14, 2012
R1HK76S0VQ724P::Great Quality product::Good - This is a great laptop with incredible specs. You almost wonder how they fit all that in this small size and still have space for a few expansion slots. I have been using this for the past 4 days and it works great. the keyboard is by far the best i have used (history - Apple Air, Dell E6500, some Toshibas...) Moving to this from my Dell 6500 was great. The weight is almost the same but you get so much more with this. Great value for money.Bad - The charger is really big and heavy...I found that the 90W charger does charge the machine only when its in sleep or its turned off. The two finger scrolling does not work.::CPTexts::4.0::November 20, 2011
RCA77BFJVVJTR::Another great thinkpad::A fantastic machine with many fine qualities and only a few negatives.The good stuff:- That bullet-proof Thinkpad build quality- The ease with which you can accomplish any upgrade.  Add RAM, a 2nd hard drive, an mSata SSD, all easy as pie.- Fantastic support.  Keyboard breaks?  They'll ship you a new one and its easy to install.- Fantastic keyboard.  Simply the best typing feel, and the layout is near perfect.- A high quality trackpad that works properly, including palm rejection that MANY other PCs simply can't get right.- The fabulous red isopoint that you can use if you want- Very very fast- Decent battery life for what it is- Great screen- The machine stays cool and quiet under all conditions- There is a great dock for this machine available if you use it on a desk a lot.The not-so good:- The speakers are really quite mediocre.  Even in a quiet hotel room you might have trouble hearing some dialog on a TV show or movie you watch.- Some of the crapware included with these machines is just there to increase the boot time.  Spend some time and clean some of this stuff out.- It really is big and heavy, and the 170W power brick really is relatively gigantic- To my mind its time for ALL laptops to ship with small mSata boot SSDs alongside rotating media drives for your data.  The good news is you can configure this machine that way easily after you buy the SSD.  But there should be options to have Lenovo ship it that way.- Like others I really preferred the old 1920x1200 displays that you can't buy any more in the big 16:9 movement- The docks that Lenovo sells now are kind of crappy compared to the older ones.  Given the cheap plastic they make them out of now I'm not sure attaching a security cable to the dock really accomplishes a whole lot.::Glenn Connery::5.0::October 3, 2011
R30D9CIO0SZ2BI::Best on paper.. but 2 deaths already!::I researched my options for fast reliable workstations long and hard. I work overseas and need a reliable and powerful machine. On paper the W520 seems like the best bet, and I have had great success with Thinkpad's in the past, however this is not the case with the w520.The first week it performed flawlessly, on day 8 it would not turn on. I had powered it down for the night and in the morning it was just dead. I checked all usual suspects and contacted Lenovo. Came to the conclusion after long troubleshooting session over the phone with someone I could not even understand that the motherboard was most likely fried, and they have had the same issue before. They shipped the return box promptly free of charge with preprinted labels (a+ for effort) after a few weeks in the shop I got the laptop back supposedly fixed with mother board replacement and a few other things. No more than 3 days later the same thing, wouldn't turn on, no bios screen, nothing. called Lenovo again and they tried to say it's just a glitch and had static built up, and it was no big deal, they had my take it apart and disconnect internal battery. still didn't fix the issue. so I go through the whole process again. and Again get the repair order saying yet another motherboard is fried.So for a laptop that claims superior quality and reliability this has hit as far from the mark as possible! I am now overseas for 4 months using my old laptop b/c there's no way I can trust the w520. In less than a month's time it has completely failed. So now it has become my wife's laptop until it needs to be fixed again at which point I will have to cut my loses and get them to take it back or throw it in the dumpster.I had a huge love for the IBM Thinkpads, and after this I have no faith in Lenovoperiod!::desert gnome::1.0::December 19, 2011
R2WCZVQ1PY80M7::Do not buy this laptop .. this is a piece of crap::I bought this laptop 1.5 years back and it was in top of the line back then...it shuts down with no reason..even if you carry it from one place to other..I called in the technician for help (as I shelled out close to 2 grand buying warranties..)..and he could not figure out.. I hated this laptop every day..I installed a bunch of software on it.. and now I am thinking to throw it in dumpster after taking the backup..what a waste of money..::HighlyUnsatisfiedCustomer::1.0::October 11, 2013
R2WVI8DU7FTBDT::Not as tough as it looks::With its sturdy lid, excellent keyboard, and hefty hinges, the W520 feels solid and powerful, but in practice, I've been disappointed to find it's a delicate device that seems unusually prone to hardware failures.I use mine for regular computing and video editing. Its NVidia card makes it perfect for working with Adobe CS5, and its built-in screen is superb. It mostly sits on a desk, attached to a second monitor, keyboard, hard drive, and mouse. A few weeks after buying it, I turned off the computer, unplugged the plugs, and moved it from one room to another. When I turned it on again, the screen was dead. No sign of damage - just black. The screen had to be replaced under warranty.A few weeks later, and the same thing happened again. I take the computer to a meeting, take it out of its (heavily padded) bag, and no screen. That time, the motherboard had to be replaced. After that, I was afraid to move it, and kept the computer on my desk.I started to feel a little foolish, treating this sturdy laptop like a desktop machine. After all, the problem had been fixed. I took a chance and brought the computer to a meeting in a big padded backpack. No problems. It left the house on two more occasions, and worked like a champ. Then, buoyed up by the prospect of a laptop that could be moved from one place to another without self-destructing, I carefully moved the laptop from my desk to a table in another room. Turned it on and both the screen and keyboard are dead.I'll have to send it off for repair again. After that, with my warranty period coming to an end in a few months, I guess my rule will have to be that I don't EVER move it off the desk.To their credit, Lenovo has a good number of service outlets - mostly independent shops with varying levels of service - but each return means at least a week with no computer.I have no idea what's causing these problems. Maybe there's some lemon component that the repair people haven't identified. Maybe it has an unusual susceptibility to static. Or maybe I'm just unlucky. One thing is for sure - despite its power and physical heft, this expensive machine is not as tough as it looks. In fact, it is the most delicate computer I've ever owned.::Amy McKenize::2.0::April 6, 2012
R293BY0YABFIH9::Workhorse::I purchased this as a replacement for a 4 year old portable Dell workstation. Initially, I was concerned about the W520 as being too big and too heavy, but much to my surprise, it's lighter than my old 14" laptop. This machine is a monster number crunching machine. It runs my Autocad, Solidworks,several specialized engineering programs, and the slew of standard Microsoft Office products, all at the same time without breaking a sweat. Amazingly, this laptop runs very cool, and I don't even hear the fans running.- This is my first Thinkpad and I see why the keyboard is legendary. It feels great!- Processors are very fast and haven't noticed any lag, even when running tons of programs at once.- Lenovo's software pre-installed takes time to get used to but is actually well thought out- Start up and shut down is amazingly fast- Battery life is seriously beyond 6 hours while during heavy useThere are other reviews that do a better job of describing the specifications, which I've read and are very helpful, but I wanted to give my honest personal impressions. This model is great for a power user and easily overkill for a basic user. Great buy for the price too!::Hieu D. Dao::5.0::February 7, 2012

RP105JCISE4X8::If I could give it negative stars I SURE WOULD !::I recently bought a Thinkpad w520 from Amazon for over $1,200Unfortunately,  it looked good on paper - not in real life. The machine does not work as it simply does not shutdown; it needs to be unplugged and the battery needs to be removed for it to start working. I have contacted the technical support department 3 times, to no avail. I have done system restores - yet again to no avail.  I finally decided to return but unfortunately, it is past the return date to Amazon.  Lenovo is refusing to take it back.I have called the following departments and spent about 2.5 hours on the phone. Note, they hanged up on me twice during the process.Returns: 1-866-428-4465  talked to a ShivaReseller department: 1-866-428-4456 and talked to Imran UbbinWholesale department: 1-877 -536-9955, talked to a supervisor called Sadik AsbahNone of them were willing to offer any plausible solutions to my situation.

R265YSSQ2A8NSH::Lenovo W520::Bought a high end Lenovo W520 directly from Lenovo.It is the best performing computer I've ever had.  The graphics and power are great.One reason for purchase was the famous reputation for build quality and the delightful to use "solid" keypad on Thinkpads.  The keypad was NOT solidly supported and had flex at one end.Had hopes that maybe "some" of that famous IBM Thinkpad build quality might have been inherited.At the very first use, a key popped off the keypad when typing normally. Exam under magnification showed key had been damaged / glued.Now another key has broken on the replacement keypad. The plastic moldings, for attaching the keys, is extremely fragile and weak.A piece of the air vent grill has broken out and the "J" mouse cover came off.Even had a USB plug guide break (plastic part again). Normal use.Abusive user, eh? As an engineer, I've used different brands of computers all my life...Have never experienced this before with any brand or model except....  an early ProStar laptop with cheap plastic that had some of these same problems.The build quality of this generation of Thinkpads is so much lower than the original IBM Thinkpad, that, to me, it severs the heritage.My 8 year old Dell Inspiron 7200 was a "tank" compared to this Lenovo Thinkpad.This machine dual boots into Windows 7 Pro 64 and Linx operating systems (primary).  It runs both without problems.The "J" mouse, and buttons, have proven very useful to me...especially when doing pixel level editing.First time I ever got an extended warranty.  Glad I did.Lenovo's contract service has been good and contacts with Lenovo directly have been satisfactory.Were it not for build quality, I would rate this laptop an easy 5.  Very disappointed and would definitely shop before buying again.These Thinkpads are NOT IBM Thinkpads.::Roy C. Lewis "zzoom"::3.0::April 20, 2014
R2VF0DLGCB0Q0T::Excellent laptop::All is excellent : the keyboard, the screen, the performance, the design , the battery ... simply perfect. I'm even  buying the w530 now :)::Hichem::5.0::September 1, 2013
R1RZ39M4U3UBNI::Additional nonstandard keys on keyboard F-::Yeah, like some others I find this computer to be buggy:-volume buttons get stuck and don't work sometimes-windows search index randomly shuts down (no matter how many reinstalls/reformats)-Not particularly compatible with SSDs-cd randomly pops out-It will wake up inside a bag and discharge sometimesBut worst of all, the additional back and forward keys for internet browsing that are near the arrow keys. It is way too easy to hit forward or back while filling out forms which looses everything. I've physically removed the keys but it still happens. Lame.::milton1234::2.0::March 5, 2013
R1F9GZF9HLZY7M::not impressed::Likes: 16gb ram, fast hard drive, finger print readerdislikes: small screen, keyboard feel, keyboard layout (no number pad), weight and balance, speakers are junk!, mic doesn't work from the factory, mic/speaker input/output is just a single 3.5mm jack for a headset only (ie no separate speaker out/ mic in) very unattractive design, high resolution monitor = cannot read anything like icon names, loud processor and video card (yes, you can hear it squeak and think while rotating CAD models)::Clayton Jacobs::2.0::February 25, 2013
R33VGFFS8KPIKV::Not so great value, but it works::I have had all sorts of notebooks for past two decades and always liked IBM/Lenovo because of its solid hardware and high resolution screen.  It is all of that, but the W520 has some unacceptable weaknessess:a)  Almost every time I start it up it is confused about the wifi bringing up some sort of Lenovo access center. Often, I have to restart the machine.b) It is extremely heavy (nearly 6 lbs) and the power adaptor by itself weighs in at an additional 2 lbs (which I initially overlooked). Because of the heavy adaptor, it does not fit in the same bag that my old lenovo fits in.c) The harddisk of the model I have is less than 500 GbFor the adaptor weight and size and startup problems alone I would not recommend that anybody buy this for a price over $1000. For that price, there are better notebooks.::A. Vandervelden "avdvldn"::3.0::July 16, 2012
R39NSSYOBCUP::Best notebook money can buy::The Lenovo ThinkPad W-series are really the best money can buy when it comes to notebooks. I love the 36 month warranty as well. Compared to the W500 I owned before this W520 the sound volume is too low however. I also feel the W500 was built with stronger materials. The display is a huge improvement however when it comes to brightness.::Mandy::5.0::May 25, 2012
R2XEEQK3PSYS4F::touchpad is practically unusable::Pros:Powerful processor makes daily computing fast.Cons:Dual finger scrolling is basically broken.  Worse, it interferes with normal (single-finger) navigation, rendering it extremely unpleasant to use.  I searched all over the internet but none of the suggestions fixed the problem.  And, there seems no way to disable dual-finger completely.Overall:I owned a W500 before having this W520.  W520 is much faster than its predecessor, thanks to the new cpu.  However, I give W500 touchpad a 4-star, but 0 for that on W520.  W520 also loses significant screen height to W500 -- crucial amount that makes viewing high resolution content much more difficult.Aside buying this laptop, get yourself external mouse and monitor so you can really enjoy using it.::adamahbz8::2.0::May 5, 2012
R2RU52QQPAR7KZ::Great machine!!::I'm really satisfied with this purchase so far. I've been looking for a mobile workstation for a while and I believe this is the best deal within this price range.::Alexis M. Aquino::4.0::February 8, 2012
R1D9PPJUGZVGQO::Motherboard had a short::I got this in Novemver and barely used it. And one day it just does not boot. I took it to service center and it appeared that motherboard had a short and that it affected other components as well. also the technician told me that the battery also had low voltage. Such defects are unacceptable for a machine costing over 1500. I wish I could return this back. will never buy Lenovo again. I wish I had bought Sony instead. Very disappointed...::Arthur::1.0::February 29, 2012
R2AJR9MNBCTET5::Worth the price you pay ...::Normally I do not write reviews. However, I used this machine for a week and could not resist to boast of the capabilities.I used  a dell xps 15 prior to this one, for only 4 months and could not wait to get rid of that one. W520, although twice costly as much as the dell, it is still worth each penny you pay.  In terms of computational power, graphics, battery .. you name it ...::Vj::5.0::January 11, 2012
R2VRVNVWPCUC6J::Quality changed for the worst since Chinese bought IBM::I ordered my W520 from Lenovo website and I'm using it since June 2012.Back in 2004 IBM Thinkpad was really high quality notebook, though now that Chinese own it quality suffers.The BAD:1.  Now after more than half a year of using it, keyboard is making noise and I had to repair several stuck keys.  Once in a while when I type keyboard throws out garbage.  Basically I soon will have to buy a new keyboard.2.  Mouse pad got polished.  It comes with bubbly surface from the factory, now that bubbly surface is gone in the middle.3.  Poor construction.  On left corner, away from the screen, it constantly makes noise when I handle it.  Tightening the screw did not help.4.  Battery rattles.I paid $2000 for my notebook and I expect quality, and I did not get quality, thus my 3 star rating.  If I was going to buy a new notebook today I would not get Lenovo, instead I'd look into HP.  Chinese took an excellent brand, Thinkpad, and lowered quality.  DO NOT BUY LENOVO.  I can also attest to my statement from my other experiences with Lenovo.  I often fix notebooks, it is my job, and the #1 brand that comes in to me is Lenovo.  Problems are as always, broken plastics, broken hinges.  Keep in mind, Lenovo is not IBM, Lenovo is made in China, and everything that is made in China suffers in quality department.3 stars, this product does not deserve more.  I would have given it 5 the first week that I bought it, but I waited 6 months just to see how it performs.::Alexander Chukhlebov "beaver"::3.0::December 17, 2012
R2ZDIFUKWY4CCI::Good service!!!::I bought this laptop last month but i didn't receive it yet, maybe the fedex driver sent it to the wrong address, suddenly i complained to the seller. Less than 3 days as the seller promised to me, they sent me another same laptop with extra security. Little bit annoying because the fedex want me picked up the package to the fedex office at that day.I received the laptop and it was completly what i want. As i saw the review before, the charger is heavy and big. But doesn't matter for me. I love this machine so much. Thank you for LaptopAuthority!::Pen Name::5.0::May 15, 2012
R3769XTIKWZ7T3::Just ain't the same::I've been a Thinkpad guy since the T20 days and was torn when Lenovo acquired them.  Could a foreign company really maintain the same quality control and engineering standards that set IBM apart?  I was skeptical but cautiously optimistic.  I decided to upgrade my (IBM) T60 to a (Lenovo) W520.In short, it's a decent laptop but no IBM.First, some history.1.  The IBM executive who built the Thinkpad brand is Stephen Ward.  A 26 year IBM veteran, a USAToday article described him as -- "every inch the IBMer, from his navy blue suit to the gold company pin fastened neatly on his lapel. He's not as flashy as some tech CEOs, and he runs a formal office compared with many laid-back Silicon Valley firms."2.  Then Lenovo bought the unit.  They made Stephen Ward CEO with a plan to continue running everything the old IBM way.3.  But there were problems from the start.  There was an immediate culture clash between Lenovo's business model of cost cutting, budget laptops and IBM's values of superior products and build quality.  Adding to the difficulty was the fact that the Lenovo staff (now 50% of the Thinkpad dept), could not even speak English.  So they had no ability to understand or communicate with their new leader.4.  To say the least, the integration posed big challenges.  But before it could be completed, Mr. Ward strangely left the company.  This was after just 6 months.5.  What happened next was telling.  He was replaced.  But not by another IBM veteran.  Rather, by William J. Amelio, a senior vice president at (of all places)... Dell.  Other key executive positions were filled, and not with IBM people.  Rather, with folks from places like HP, Acer and Lenovo.6.  Thereafter, a high level of executive turnover ensued.  In 2009, William Amelio was eventually fired as CEO and the job fell back to Lenovo's old CEO, Yang Yuanqing.  Other key executives came and went, at least some leaving to go to Dell.7.  The results have been sadly predictable.  Amazon reviews of Thinkpads have sunk substantially.  If you compare reviews of the old IBM products they got high ratings.  For instance, the t60 (IBM's last model) enjoys a healthy 4.5 stars and 21 reviews as of this writing (not uncommon among the old IBM thinkpads).  The newer Lenovos?  Not so much.  These have tended to get about 3.5 stars and receive significantly more complaints.8.  What are those complaints about?  Mostly basic design and quality control issues.  Back in the IBM days, this was less of a problem because the company offered very few laptops (typically just the R and T series).  The limited menu was to ensure that much thought and effort was put into each product and it worked flawlessly.  Lenovo on the other hand runs on a different philosophy.  Instead of a limited menu, Lenovo offers a virtual Denny's restaurant of laptops (a whopping thirteen series in all).9.  But pumping out so many laptops naturally results in more issues.  There are so many models to keep track of, and with so many different glitches and problems it's nearly impossible to keep them all up to date.So that's about it.  A great brand that has sort of petered out, sadly.As you ponder that, why not reflect on the man who used to make your old rigs.  Stephen Ward, the 26 year IBM veteran.  According to the article (see below), he grew up in Santa Maria along the California coastline.  As a kid he worked in his father's gas station, pumping gas and washing windows.  Then he went to Cal State San Luis Obispo to get his engineering degree (I hear they have a great engineering school).  From there he went to IBM.  Neatly sporting his IBM lapel on his old fashioned suit.  For 26 years maintaining the IBM culture of superior products, quality control and no nonsense values.You know, I bet the Lenovo guys are just as good.[...]::Douglas A.

R3ELM5EVS0JUKZ::Good purchase::The Thinkpad represents excellent value for money - providing top-end capacity and quality for substantially less than the models of most competitors. Very happy with the purchase, and will have no hesitation in buying another.::Paul::5.0::December 7, 2011
R3EJDDXZLAHAEE::Very dissapointed in Lenovo::Have had very bad experience with this product and I want to share it so you don't make the same mistake. Lenovo customer service did not deliver on this purchase.I Bought this top of line laptop in early December with 8 GB of memory and all the bells and whistles including SSD hard drive. the System arrived right before the holiday and I was heading out of town so my first chance to use it was not until early January. After setting this machine up I was very impressed with the speed and features. The machine was great. Then it failed 7 days later. It would not start up. The machine was in a docking station the whole time. After calling Lenovo and running through troubleshooting steps with them, they determined it needed to be send back.I asked them if they can just send a new one but they said no sorry we can only do that within 21 days and you have had the system 24 days (customer service failure #1). They said they would overnight a box and I would get the system back in 6 days (overnight after repair). The box took 2 days to get to my place (not a big deal). I then sent it back hoping to have the system repaired in a week. I understand that sometimes things happen and I was not holding against the product. Every Thinkpad I had ever owned was solid.Now from here the customer service spirals out of control. The system went back to Lenovo on Jan 11th. I inquired with them around the 15th to see where we were with the repair and they sent me to a web site where I was able to see it was holding for parts. I asked them what this means and how long it might be. They said they have no idea how long it takes and they have no way to get an estimate of delivery on parts. IBM handles the repair process and when I called Lenovo they referred me back to IBM. When I complained to IBM they said we will escalate to Lenovo since they have the part that IBM needs to install. I have been on the phone with various people from IBM and Lenovo and no one has been able to help me or  even taken an initiative to get a resolution. It just gets passed on. The latest update on the web is that the system is still waiting for parts. IBM escalated this to Lenovo and said I would be contacted within 48 hours.  I was not contacted.This has been a nightmare. I paid a lot of money for a laptop in early December and here it is February 5th and I have no system, no communication, and 100% lost faith in Lenovo as a company. I am now going through the process of filing a complaint with American Express and have already submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau. In searching the web I cam across this site which highlights how bad Lenovo's issues are. There are new complaints against the company every day.[...]Lenovo has no excuse for not following up with their customers on issues especially when they have been escalated and when promised  a follow-up within 48 hours.I loved Thinkpads up until now and I think some of my initial fears (when Lenovo bought IBM) are coming to fruition. The quality has gone down and the customer service does not exist. This is the first brand new laptop I have ever had fail within a year of purchase (and this one failed after only 7 days) and I buy a fair number of these as I am an IT tech and buy these for customers.Buyer Beware.::Thomas C.

R3PKTKKYBU2S9F::Great laptop::This computer didn't have a review when I bought it last September, and it deserves better than one star.

R2JD2FVNV0Z89B::Best laptop ever::i bought this laptop in October 2011 for 1800 and it is still wonderful.  I am amazed that two and a half  years later it isselling for more than what I paid.  Best laptop ever and I have been on them since 1982.::Dragonfly51::5.0::June 8, 2014
R27NDD4YAMK8FD::Desktop killer!::I will disclose the obvious, I am biased toward HP products. That said, my company recently swapped out our laptops under contract from a competitive brand to the HP Elitebook 8440p. I was really happy to say the least! After having been around the HP Pavilion product line and the HP Mini 110 lines for quite a while, I was shopping for a new personal laptop and the 8440p really hit the button for me. I called HP small business sales and had a very informative discussion with a salesman and he informed me that the 8460p was the newer replacement and that I would find it might even be affordable compared to the older model.Now for some details:Processor is the iCore5 and it can be upgraded in the future because it has the ZIF mount. Also, the specs. were not clear but there are two memory banks and it comes with a 4gb filled in one so you have usable memory if you want to upgrade. (I remember the days of getting your memory in smaller size and populating all banks so that if you wanted to upgrade, you needed to chuck them all and start fresh).I got looking at my optical drive and since I had a spare new blue ray player / dvd burner slim sata drive, I thought what the heck, wonder if it would work? yup! now if you might like the fact that you do not need tools to pull the cover off to access the memory and hard drive area, and your Windows COA label is now protected under the battery so you won't have them become damaged and worn off like on my previous model.graphics and sounds are very good for a laptop, especially a business one. very neat features like built in smart card reader, finger print scanner, business card scanner, USB3 ports, express-card expansion slot, ability for docking station and secondary battery attachment. the construction of this laptop is very solid and rugged. I feel like the price I paid was very much of a steal for what I got compared to the normal plastic computers at the box stores. the positive latching lid, multiple wireless options, battery configurations and endless power with the HP super battery (I don't remember their name for it, but they have one) all add up to make one heck of a desktop killer. I can honestly say that with the docking station and the processor and memory options, I am ready to retire the desktop!too many other good things about this to list, but maybe another owner will pick up the football and run with it.::Michael McGarghan::5.0::June 28, 2011
R2LFNM5WE9CLNT::Great keyboard and build quality, terrible screen, audio and 3d performance.::For those unwilling to read this long, long review, the title of my review sums it up for you. Scroll down to where I explain the Pros & Cons if you like, but I am providing a more detailed explanation of my experience for those interested.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I received this laptop through my school's Campus HP program, and I have to say, it is a very well built laptop all round. Feels sturdy as a rock, lifting the lid is easy with the big release button. There is slight flex in the screen though but this is not a big issue. The rest of the body is very very sturdy. The keyboard is one of the best keyboards I have ever worked on, hands down. I am extremely impressed. That said, I do not like the new format for the arrow/directional keys one bit. Making them half the size of a regular key to save space was a terrible idea and gives rise to quite many unintended key presses. But besides that it is an absolute delight to work on this keyboard. I only wish it was backlit or had a backlit-version as an optional upgrade. The touchpad is very responsive, but the extra multi-touch settings, etc are a headache to work with and I recommend getting a mouse for your work. The touchpad is great but because of the problems I mentioned, only really good for the odd surfing. Scrolling is a pain - hence get a mouse.The Screen though, is one of the most terrible screens I have ever worked with. This particular screen is the 1366x768 screen, and I have worked with the 1600x900 screen as well and there is no marked improvement. It has a matte finish which is excellent, although the only good thing about it sadly. The color range is appalling. I am a graphic design student and have messed up some of my projects on this with the screen displaying one color and the studio's printer giving me something else. I have to resort to the school's iMacs for that, sadly. I am extremely disappointed in this screen, which also has terrible viewing angles - you have to have it angled straight at you or it stresses your eyes out really fast. Audio quality of the speakers, too, is extremely, extremely bad. One of the worst speakers ever - I feel embarrassed to playback audio/video clips in class using my laptop because of its pathetic sound reproduction as well as low volume output. Highly suggest you get headphones or connect this laptop to proper speakers for any music listening because it will butcher your tracks.Performance wise, the processor is zippy and extremely fast; at the very last this get your work done for the next 2-3 years with ease. It overclocks marvelously with Turbo boost. The graphics option is really embarrassing though and I wish this came with a better option than the AMD chip it has (Mine does not even have that). For a laptop in the range of (and above) $1100, I expect at least a mid range card considering that competing brands have such options - a card like the nvidia GT 540m would have made this laptop an absolute steal. Thus for the aforementioned reasons do not even think about playing any games on this laptop - Call of Duty Black Ops stutters at around 25-30fps at best with all settings set at the lowest. Not impressive at all. The reason I recommend a better card is not for gaming, it is because I desire a good performer that can handle anything thrown at it to a somewhat respectable level, not dig its own grave and bury itself in it, like when I ran the music and gaming tests. Tad Imbalanced, huh? Hard drive performance is strictly OKAY for a 7200rpm drive. HP has its bloatware and I highly recommend you get rid of it to avoid the atrociously long boot times. Also, please do not update your BIOS to anything above F.20 (at the time of writing this review) because HP disables SATA III support on later BIOS releases. So if you have an SSD (which is an absolutely recommended upgrade) on this, your speeds will be badly throttled. Kudos, HP.Upgrading this laptop is not difficult - removing the bottom cover is extremely easy and swapping RAM in particular is extremely easy. You can also get an upgrade caddy to replace the optical drive and thus run two hard drives like I am. The layout is clean and very impressive, but this leads me to my next disappointment - this laptop runs HOT and can be really loud. Don't even think of playing games, this thing heats up to around 90'C which is TERRIBLE for a non-gaming laptop, because the components are not designed to withstand such temperatures. Consequently, the fans kick and run loud trying as they work hard to cool down. This laptop has a terrible cooling system. A cooler is highly recommended, and repasting the CPU paste with better aftermarket paste is advised if you know how to get that done.The webcam is of decent quality, the small light meant to light up your keyboard in the dark is almost useless since the screen is actually brighter. The presence of one Powered USB2.0, 2 USB3.0 ports and an eSATA/USB2.0 port is a very commendable attachment since not many laptops have the powered port (useful for charging your stuff even with the laptop off), USB3 ports or the eSATA port. The lack of an HDMI port is extremely disappointing but the DisplayPort is hardly a consolation. There is VGA for connecting to projectors for the businessmen. Also, battery life of this laptop is good, ranging around the 4-hour mark, and about 40-50 minutes more if you turn down the brightness and turn off wireless connections. I expect better from a laptop of this form factor and a lower TDP processor (35W versus 45W), though, but this is still good. Wireless range is good with the Intel 6250 card though nothing to write home about. It works inconsistently. Another strange issue with this laptop is the fact that it sometimes refuses to shut down/hibernate/sleep. It completes any of those actions you picked, but then restarts on itself within a matter of seconds. The only way to stop this is by manually removing the battery. Also, sometimes the multimedia shortcuts (fn + f6/f7/f9/f10) for the brightness and volume refuse to work at all sometimes, and only a restart fixes this. Likewise, the two USB3 ports on the side also just stop working occasionally. This can only be rectified by a hard restart.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thus:Pros: Great processing power and speeds; Good battery life; Excellent keyboard; Good (sometimes inconsistent) wireless connectivity, USB3 + USBpowered ports; Good trackpad (minus multitouch); Wonderful build quality; Good warranty; Open to upgradeability (RAM and CPU);Cons: Terrible audio and 3d performance; Terrible performance under 32-bit Windows 7 (64bit has no problems); HP bloatware; Horrible, horrible screen (the deal breaker for me); random bugs with multimedia keys and shutting down/hibernating/sleep mode; Terrible cooling system, runs hot, runs loud; Starts-up randomly for no reason sometimes despite being shutdown.Conclusion: The only reason I have this laptop is because the school requires me to have it for my second major which is business. The school's 4-year complete coverage warranty is also another incentive. I have already bought another laptop for myself and am leaving this for the most basic tasks such as web-surfing, word-processing and running business software. It is a good laptop for businessmen who don't need much but just want good build quality, or the odd college student who needs to do the most basic of work - it should thus be priced much lower in my opinion for its rather low usefulness. To anyone else, I cannot recommend this. You would be better off buying a slightly more expensive Macbook 13" or even the Macbook Air, or for less expensive options you could take a look at the Acer Aspire line or a Sony Vaio for a good looking, well built all round laptop. Sticking to HP? Go for the Envy line, they are much better overall although not as well built or with such good battery life. However the terrible speakers which will embarrass you and kill your ears, and the terrible screen which leaves much to be desired are easily the biggest turn offs that, sadly, offset the otherwise great keyboard and build quality to the point where I cannot recommend this to anyone. Hopefully they will do better with the next line of Elitebooks...OVERALL: 3.5 / 5::N. Dev Varma "nkdv"::3.0::June 7, 2012
R2MPQ7IK5M2YNO::Great computer horrible display::Love the computer hate the display. Can't work on it for more then 20 minutes without connecting an external display. I'm not a big fan of the touchpad, two finger scrolling is glitchy. The computer is rather heavy as well.::Charles::3.0::November 7, 2011
R1K5LKMD7IO1U5::Sturdy and cool with i5 and integrated graphics::I am an IBM employee and as such I enjoy a discount on Lenovo purchases. With my corporate discount, the price comes down to what you would find on newegg, tigerdirect, or amazon, but with the ability to customize the system. When I was building mine, even with the discount, the upgrades that I wanted were too expensive, so I ordered a basic configuration plus some upgrades from the sites mentioned above. My system arrived with i5 2520 CPU (the lowest possible frequency), 320 GB hdd, 2 GB RAM, and an integrated video card. Separately, I ordered 8 GB RAM, Intel 320 series SSD (160 GB capacity), and a cheaper 32 GB mSATA SSD drive (a mini-PCI card, the T420s has a slot for it), which I use for swapping and temporary files.I purposely ordered the CPU with the lowest possible frequency, and no dedicated video card. In my career, I have built and used probably two dozen different systems, and in each and every case, the CPU has never been a bottleneck, nor has been the video card. Most video cards today have GPUs which consume an enormous amount of power, need extra cooling, and drain your battery while heating your lap. I have to mention that I use computers for software development and other casual uses, but not for gaming. I could not care less how many frames per second a given game would render (TO ME it is all crap, and so far from being realistic that it is not worth the hassle -- TO ME a 1980's console Packman is more real than most of the games I see nowadays; call me old fashioned, I don't care). I want a system that would run one or more virtual machines, a development environment, and a database of a size which only the most rich and prestigious universities could afford only a few years ago. The T420s does that.It runs very cool, is fast, and is sturdy. On occasion, the fan engages, but so far it has been running only at a low speed which is not disturbing (I compare it to my T60p system with dedicated graphics which was very noisy).The keyboard is outstanding. Better than any Thinkpad (I have owned five) so far. I only wish it was back-lit. The little light on the top of the lid does a good job at illuminating the keyboard, but again I would have still preferred a back-lit one.The preloaded software is not too intrusive. If I had an option, I would never buy a system with preloaded software, but unfortunately even with this high end business system a clean build was not an option. I have made the habit of wiping off every new system I receive and install only what I need; with this one, I have not done it yet. Probably I will, once I have the time to gather all drivers. But so far it is good, I don't feel slowness, maybe also because the system is so fast.The screen is nice. It is matted, so it is easy on the eyes. If I had an option, though, I would go with 4:3 screen, which is much more convenient for writing code, but nobody makes these nowadays. I wonder, why all manufacturers think that laptops are only for watching movies?Speed. With the two SSD drives configured as a master and swap, the boot is blazing fast. I installed the second, smaller and cheaper SSD as a swap and temp drive in order to preserve the more expensive Intel drive. Windows 7 boots in 20 seconds, and an XP virtual machine boots in 8 seconds.Build quality. The MacBooks have been a standard by which I have measured the build quality and ergonomics of every other laptop, and I have to say, the T420s is better in most departments. It does not flex, it stays cool (the MacBook I compare it is a Core 2 Duo which runs hotter), and is lighter. The MacBook has a back-lit keyboard and a truly amazing display (Lenovo's display is matted which is good, but does not provide the same level of contrast).There are several things that Lenovo could have done better:1. 4:3, higher contrast screen2. back-lit keyboard3. a minimal install with no preloaded software (although this system is not as crapified as some Sony's or Dell's I have seen lately)Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it. My current configuration is very expensive and is comparable to a 15" MacBooPro's price, but I still prefer it. I have to mention that this is the first laptop I buying with my own money, if that makes my review more trustworthy. If Windows is not essential, get a Mac. For Windows, I doubt that there is a better highly portable system on the market as of today.I give it 4 stars, as there is still room for improvement. For a comparison, I would also rate a MacBook Pro at 4, and any other laptop I have found at Staples, BestBuy, Costco, etc. scores no higher than 3.::Stanislav Gatev "Stan Gatev"::4.0::July 19, 2011
R2ZRZF82D608S::Fast and light::This thin and light -- and fast -- Lenovo T420s laptop is at the top of its class. The Lenovo brand runs under the radar screen for many consumers, but builds top-technology laptops that last next-to-forever. The T420s is sick fast with a 14" screen, but only weighs 3.9 lb. You can find other lighter weight laptops, but only with dinky little 13" and 12" screens -- which is just too small to be productive and with toys for keyboards. You can look, but I don't think you'll find a better 14" laptop that is under 4 lb.The T420s also has space for three (yes three) hard drives -- the primary drive, the ultra-bay, and the mSATA slot. I bought an 80GB Intel 310 flash drive for the mSATA slot, and loaded Windows 7 on it to make it my boot drive. Then, I put all my applications on the flash drive, too, so that loading Windows and even the biggest app is lightening fast. I loaded all my docs and pictures and music on the primary drive, so I have plenty of room for more. I left the optical drive in the ultra-bay for now, but it has the option of being swapped out for a hard disk or flash drive, or a second battery. The system is whisper quite -- you can't hear the drive and the fan, when it's on, is only a faint background whirr.The best part, though, is the keyboard -- I never knew that I could type so fast. The words just seem to flow up on the screen with no effort and few mis-spellings. Crazy good. After pounding away on other keyboards for years, this one is a joy. Textured track pad works well, too, and maybe someday I'll start using the little-red joystick that others seem to like.This thing is durable, too. It was designed in the vein of the original clean-and-black ThinkPad by the legendary designer Richard Sapper. You can easily find cheaper laptops, but not ones that will last for years like this one.::Robert Hanson "BobH"::5.0::May 28, 2011
R7H4O5D1EQCRL::Best portable laptop of 2011::Have been using this for about a month.Purchased customized one (i7 2620 processor and dedicated nvidia graphic card) thru lenovo. This thing is fast!!Added OCZ vertex 3 SSD using ultra bay and it rocks! The ultrabay supports sata 3, FYI.Used ebay ultrabay adaptor with this SSD without a problem. The installation(hardware) was done within 5 mins and clean OS installation(win7) onto SSD took like 5 mins.Much cheaper than ordering SSD version from lenovo (I heard that the SSD from factory is intel's which uses sata 2 connection).You spend less money and get newer & better SSD.Had to give up DVD-rom but who cares!(I rarely use it). The overall weight slightly increased but still not a big deal.Applications like autocad, 3ds max, adobe suites load up instantly!Also, you don't need to order higher RAM from lenovo.Get aftermarket RAM and add it. It also saves your budget a lot.1600*900 display's awesome. Not being 16:10 screen? Not a problem for me.USB 3.0 blows with compatible flash drives and external harddrives.Light weight, 2nd generation processor, sandybridge chipset, high resolution screen, various expansion slots(mSATA, ultrabay), USB 3.0...what else do we expect for a laptop this year?1 star deducted due to relatively POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.Overall, despite this thing is quite expensive, I'm very satisfied with the performance. You get what you pay for! -]::nuts::4.0::August 10, 2011
R1EAZYJC2MIGVV::Great machine with a few misses::Custom configured T420s on lenovo website.  Wish I would have just bought it from Amazon and did a few upgrades myself.My machine:2.5 Ghz Core i58 GB Ram320 GB HDExterior:This machine is very nice looking, with a good design and solid feel.  It's incredibly light (3.9 lbs), such that I have to double check that I actually put it in my bag.  The build quality is excellent.  5*Screen:Love the 1600x900 display resolution and the matte screen.  Screen is beautiful and brilliant, as good as my MacBook Pro.  5*Software:Standard Win7 + all the Lenovo bloatware.  After 7 months still haven't figured it all out.  Thinkpad technologies seems like a waste especially when many of the functions are supported internally by Windows.  3*Battery Life:Here's the shocker.  It's 2011 and I have the same battery life as I did with my first Dell lappy in 2003.  Unacceptable.  I'm doing good to get 2 hrs from a full charge, and normally it's like 1.5.  I had to play with the setting to get it up this far.  ThinkPad software has lots of customizations but the computer was practically unusable for any real battery life.  Horrible.  1*Hard drive:The standard SATA 320GB 7200 RPM drive is a dog.  1*Lenovo issues:Computer has had video card, BIOS, and numerous update issues.  I was able to fix them all with a little research on the internet but a $1300 machine shouldn't have these issues that I never had with a $499 Dell.  1*Overall:3*.  A good notebook at the right price, which is $999.  Any more and it's just not worth it.  The quality and weight is good but I certainly don't get the warm and fuzzies I expected from the Lenovo brand.::Wes "Sunny Florida" D::3.0::December 11, 2011
RQMWOIO5J971P::Nice performance Terrible fan noise.::Nice performing laptop with Nvidia graphics and I5 processor. Solid state drive.Ordered DVD bay battery (good idea).The problem with this laptop is the noise emanating from the fan.My hearing isn't overly great and to me it is ridiculously loud.No notebook of this type should have such a shoddy design in that area with a fan sounding like a hair dryer 80% of the time.::DC::2.0::December 8, 2011
R2J04UK296XHSH::Very nice laptop, solid quality::Looked at many laptops to replace an old Lenovo Idepad that had the cover hinges fail after about 3 years. Had thought about other brands and even ordered an HP business class laptop to compare. But when it came down to the red navigation pointer (which are carried only on a few laptops and mosttly Lenovo's) and the one of a kind Thinkpad keyboard itself  ... we went with this model. Very nice screen, excellent build quality, minimum amount of bloatware. A good choice and the always excellent amazon service ... Fast shipping and the most liberal return policy in the business. This was a good purchase in the end at a very reasonable price.::Matt::4.0::December 25, 2011
R2BOACT4BC3BXW::Overpriced built quality::Good points:Slim, light, nice looking, works great. Nice feel of relief touchpad.The largest disappoint is the feel of soft laptop body. It has a solid frame but the plastic case around it makes the feel of something not well built and cheap. The housing bends when one presses near the ThinkPad shield at the right side and at the Windows 7 logo at the left, just a regular carrying case.They keyboard (one the main reasons to by the laptop in the world of other ugly flat keyboards) has some gaps near the Enter button and at the top where resides sound and power buttons. So when I touch keys in those areas the I feel the free space between the keyboard and a laptop body.The plastic around UltraBay also bends. When I take the laptop I till how it bends having about 1mm gap between dvd drive and the outer case plastic.The display part between hinges also is not tought. Taking the closed laptop I always thinking on how to take it carefully and not to break the display accidentally. I can't see I am able to break it that way, but it brings the uncomfortable feel of something fragile.Giving 2 start because of the case for the higher price and disappointment.::Mike S::2.0::November 30, 2011
R1LQZMT4FV7SV2::No longer a solid IBM product -- this is a cheaply built look-alike now::It has been several years since IBM sold its PC division to the Chinese manufacturer Lenovo, but after owning several ThinkPads over the years, I have unfortunately concluded that the ThinkPads of today are no comparison to the solidly built IBM products that earned ThinkPads their sterling reputation in the past.I have owned this T420s for a few months and have disliked it since the day I pulled it out of the box.  I don't hate it, but it's just not worthy of its price tag.  Two examples of how cheaply built it is: (1) The superb ThinkPad keyboard feel is gone, replaced by a cheap look-alike that isn't nearly as nice to type on and makes a distinctly annoying noise when you hit certain keys near the edge of the keyboard; (2) the on-screen volume indicator, which worked perfectly for years on my last ThinkPad, works only intermittently on this one.I wouldn't buy this computer.  Instead, you could spend far less and get more.UPDATE: MAY 7, 2012:After using this product for six months, this Think Pad died yesterday.  The screen shows a "disk error" message, and the only options it is offering are to (1) erase everything on the hard drive and start over; or (2) to shut down the system.What a horrible piece of junk.::AMG::2.0::November 27, 2011
RDUJ100KIC0RM::Great Hardware except Display::I've been using Macbook Pros and iMacs for the last several years.  But due to Microsoft's inability to write a stable and compatible version of Microsoft Office, I find myself needing Windows.  Windows 7, btw, is a very good operating system.Bought the T420s direct from Lenovo and added a MSATA SSD (80gb from Intel).  The laptop screams and is very stable.  I love it except...  in comparison to the amazing Apple displays built into the Macbook Pro and Air lines, the T420s display is horrible to use.  The display makes me think I am looking through mosquito netting.I am going back to Mac.::T. Schauer "hacker, photographer, designer"::3.0::October 30, 2011
R5JKVR80DS8N7::Expensive piece of top of the line garbage - I miss my T410s::Good computer but for one fundamental flaw: the VOIP experience is DISMAL. The microphone could not be any worse. I consistently get horrible rain in the background and strange noises coming in and out. Furthermore the T420s dims the sound of the keys when typing, instead of eliminating it like the T410s did. End result: the listener can hear you when you type, just like it happens on any cheap computer.Lenovo, what have you done? You have upgraded the T410s and made it as good as a regular laptop.I also experience pretty serious keyboard flex on the left side, and it should be mentioned that the new 16:9 format (supposed to be an upgrade from the 16:10 the T410s had) is a true pain.IF YOU HAVE A T410S DO NOT UPGRADEI rate it with one star because I hate having upgraded to this piece of garbage.Note: I am Windows computer savvy.::Alexis "Alexis"::1.0::November 26, 2011
R3UPSRDJGTYFRM::I LIKE  THIS LAPTOP . BUY IT IF DECENT KEYBOARD IS IMPORTANT TO YOU::I have been an owner of this laptop for  3 months so I cannot judge its long term reliability. I had purchased a cheaper HP model with windows 8 on it and touch screen. I returned it because  i did not like the feel of the keyboard and the mouse.I could not find a nice laptop with  decent keyboard in stores so I took a risk  and ordered thinkpad t420s.The good:I5 processor ( my model has 8 gb ram and both integrated and dedicated graphics)14'' inch screen, not too big and not too smalllightweight, feels less than 4 lbs ( not as heavy and bulky as thinkpad 420)nice and comfortable keyboard -not shallow( this is the last model before they introduced chiclet keyboard )silent fandoes not overheatdecent performancestrong hingesfeels solidthinkpad light is useful in low lightdvd drive very responsiveeasily upgradableUSB 3 portadditional keysspill resistant keyboardyou can close the lid of the laptopremovable batteryThe bad:the mouse - I do not like its texture and no ability to scroll they way I could on my old laptopthe speakers are ok but my old hp and newer hp laptops both have much louder speakers, about 30% loudermicrophone ok , could be betterno backlit keyboardno touchscreenthe screen could have better contrast.battery life is not very long,  2 hours on averageI recommend this computer if you need  comfortable keyboard , light weight and do not need the newest and the greatest. This computer feels more solid in my hands than the new computers in stores and I would choose it over Macbook computers as well. I hope my thinkpad t420s will work well for many years .::Barb::4.0::March 1, 2014
R17HM8AIXE9Y3::A great second-gen Core i5 machine::Intel's Core i5 processor is a terrific platform for any notebook, but I love what Lenovo has done with the second-gen Sandy Bridge i5 in the T420s. Even though this model has been discontinued by Lenovo (it was an early 2011 release), it's better in many ways than the follow-on T430s, with longer battery life (seven hours, realistically, with a drive-bay battery) and a much nicer keyboard. In fact, it's the nicest keyboard I've ever experienced in 30 years of IT work. I looked at a T430s, the replacement model, but decided on a T420s with a 120G SSD. The i5 really takes advantage of the SSD's speed!If you've used the T420, this new model is nothing like that older version. It's got a sleeker, tapered look, and feels much better, including in the keyboard. It's a pound lighter, and adds USB3 and DisplayPort.The T420s has got great specs for both Win7 and Win8: 8GB memory, fast NVidia 1GB VRAM graphics (optional, be sure to get it), multitouch trackpad, and 1600x900 screen rez. And you can open the screen flat-out horizontal, which I love for my desk stand. Built in 720p webcam, stereo mic, and stereo speakers are great for GoToMeeting. The super-thin LED screen is anti-glare, not gloss, and I like that. But the 300:1 contrast isn't remarkable. Movies look a little flat on it.But this is not a multimedia machine, it's a work platform. Text and graphics look stunning. The 14" high-rez widescreen has very sharp resolution. The notebook is not thin, either, but it's very light, with an extremely robust magnesium frame case. At an inch thick and four pounds, the thing is no problem for a briefcase. I wouldn't want to tote it in a sleeve, though.  I recommend third-party upgrading to 8GB of RAM, since you can get a whole 8GB kit for just fifty bucks these days. I run VMware Workstation on mine and use it as a virtualization platform, with an external SSD to hold VHDs (a sweet little Oyen USB3 port-powered speedster).Typical notebook networking: a GigE port, and built-in Intel Centrino 1x2bgn, which doesn't seem spectacular. But with two internal PCI slots, you could put in a real MIMO card if you needed it.Some innovative touches: the "ThinkLight" keyboard flood light (on the screen top middle), rather than back-lighted keys, so you get some terrific ambient illumination when working in the dark. I love that!  The keyboard is spill-resistant, and for a frequent air traveler that's important. It's got USB3, SD, and ExpressCard. ExpressCard is nice for adding additional ports such as Ethernet, serial, eSata, etc. Alas, it lacks HDMI, but it has a DisplayPort, so it can drive two external 27" monitors with some inexpensive adapters. It's got a modular bay design, so you can, for example, replace the DVD drive with an aux battery or second HD. All tool-less: click, slide, snap, you've completely reconfigured the machine! I put a second 500G HD in mine, and use an external SSD as well. I have lots of bits ;)I do wish it had an external mic or stereo line in, though. Without that, I'm stuck with USB audio for SDR, a hobby of mine. I'll have to get an ExpressCard for that.And after a year-long stint with a Dell, the Lenovo's compact, super-thin external power supply is a traveler's joy.With the new model out, the T420s are priced right, too.::Mel Beckman::5.0::August 17, 2012
R3MHAAM72RONH0::Best Thinkpad yet::I love the t420s; it's the best thinkpad I've owned to date.  I haven't had a thinkpad this thin since my t40, and that was a long while ago.  The keyboard remains solid, and the exterior is as nice as ever.  Sandy bridge is nice and powerful as advertised.  Battery is long enough, but as always longer would be nicer.Boots quick and the ThinkVantage software is still excellent.One big seller for me is the APS (Active Protection System).  This stops the moving hard drive when motion is detected to prevent data loss in the event of a dropped laptop or whatever.  To my knowledge, this feature is only available in Thinkpads and Macbooks.Another cool feature: one of the USB ports will charge devices when the computer is in sleep, and even some phones (for example, the iPhone) when powered completely off!  This is an awesome feature which can turn your laptop into a charging station (for example on a long flight, when you might care more about having your phone powered than laptop).Main complaint is the slim HDD bay which can only take special 7mm HDDs.  There are only 2 7200RPM HDDs which fit in that bay (the 320GB and a recently released 500GB).  With the falling prices of SSDs, this isn't a big problem.Bluetooth, Centrino Ultimate-N, 720p Webcam, USB3.0, DisplayPort.  These are great modern features.What an excellent machine this sturdy and thin T420S is!::Streetbeat "Russ"::5.0::June 25, 2012
R16ABUBR21VETS::Daily driver; can't go wrong with Thinkpad::You can't go wrong with a Thinkpad and this T model is your business workhorse circa a couple of years ago.  Which means it's still fine for today (5/2014).  I5 cpu is great.  Mine has 8 GB memory which makes it even faster.::Thomas Hundt::5.0::May 14, 2014
RQCD9QMF3FZSL::Bulletproof::I've been using this laptop for over two years.  So far it's been bulletproof.  It was very fast when I first got it.  It's slowing down a bit now, which means it's time for me to back up all my data and reinstall the OS.  All the junk I've installed on it over the years has slowed it down quite a bit.In my office I have two large Dell monitors.  This laptop powers the two displays just fine.  I can even add a third if I felt like leaving the lid open on the laptop, but I don't have enough room on my desk and I prefer to close the lid when it's docked.The keyboard is very comfortable and responsive.  The track pad is decent or I can use the little red button thingy as a pointer if I don't like track pads (I never really use that thing though).I use the built in camera and mic at least once a day for video calls.  I've never had a problem with either one of them.The 14" display is OK, but not great.  The quality of the image is fine and the screen stays pretty clean, but I prefer a larger display.  I work remotely quite a bit though and I get used to the small display pretty quickly.I've traveled a zillion miles with this thing and it has put up with a ton of abuse.  I try to take good care of it, but it's inevitable that it gets bumped and dinged quite a big going through security, etc.  I also take public transportation to work (a train and a bus).  Public transportation is a full contact sport.  My bag gets knocked all over the place.  This laptop has held up just fine though.I work this little machine pretty hard.  I document technical services for a living, so it's pretty common for me to have complicated applications running (the apps that I'm documenting) as well as the tools that I use to document them with (Photoshop, Visio, Dreamweaver, Word, etc.).  I usually have at least three of these tools running at the same time without too much of a performance hit.At the end of this year when it's time for IT to issue me another machine, I'll be happy if it's the latest & greatest version of this same line.  I have no complaints with this one.::Dave Edmiston::4.0::April 18, 2014
R1MZHKSAE8R37B::it's very stable::I saw some negative reviews about this laptop and decided to give my opinions. There are 16 of us were issued this laptop by the company and they all worked fine for the last two years. None of us ever had any problems with the it. the only cons is it's super slow to restart. I think that's because I don't restart the machine very often.::Chuan::4.0::March 26, 2014
R3K1AX90IUJ6SQ::Excellent computer!!::I have been using this laptop for almost 2 years and I absolutely love it. It's light and fast, if I had just one complaint it's that I need more memory but that isn't that big of a deal as I have a large external hard-drive to save excess photos and videos.I have no idea why some of these reviewers have had issues, maybe they did not have good virus protection/firewall setup. I am using ESET NOD32 virus protection and it never bothers me and I have never had a problem.I use this computer for designing marketing brochures and office management. Almost every day I have Outlook, Word, Excel, OneNote, InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop etc open simultaneously. I very rarely experience lags in opening documents.I searched for this computer just now because I was thinking about buying one for myself since this is my work computer. I am genuinely surprised at the bad reviews... I hate to say it but.. user error???::H. MCCARTHY "bunnynose"::5.0::December 10, 2013
R3QAUVIDWRA6QU::Disappointing and frustrating experience... but never again!::I am incredibly disatisfied with Lenovo AND the Thinkpad brand.The computer is absolutely beautiful, you will like it. it is small, thin and light... but if you expect good customer service, this is not the brand to go.Since you're purchasing online, if there is anything wrong with your computer, you will have to deal with the problem over the phone and THEY WILL JERK YOU AROUND. They will make you wait, transfer you, make you wait some more, transfer you again and in the end may not even solve the problem.My actual story? Bought a brand new Thinkpad and a month later motherboard dies! Lenovo refuses to replace the machine (or failing part) under warranty. I'd like to point out that I use my computer at a laboratory at my school so I didn't have any accidents with the computer nor was it directly exposed to the elements. In short, Lenovo sold me a $1000 defective unit, failed to own up to the problem and wasted my time and money... not cool.- Lenovo refused to repair the computer under warranty attempting to charge me $750 for the repair. I'm a poor college student who had already WASTED over a grand on a computer -- I can't afford that!- I called IBM 4 U and explained my problem. They sent me another box so I could send back my nonworking machine.- The EZ serv people once again could not fix the computer without me paying. This time they needed to replace the speakers as well... uhh, there was nothing wrong with the speakers.- Sent me the computer back without fixing it.- I have to add as well that Lenovo has absolutely no interest in following up on you experience. And, because it's such a pain to have to ship and receive the computer multiple times, it becomes an exhausting problem.Conclusion - Defects in computers are unavoidable and you might be the unlucky person to waste money and time in such an unfortunate way. However, you may avoid this problem by buying your machine from a physical store so you are not jerked around and left feeling powerless. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THINkPAD - But I learned my lesson... never again Lenovo.::Ed::1.0::March 21, 2012
R2TL4F6ZRT378F::Never Lenovo.....never again.....::I bought thinkpad t420s from Lenovo website directly and also purchased extended next business day on-site warranty for $300 more...what was I thinking....-  Only a few months after purchasing it started to crash/restart when I touch the keyboard.-  Technician over the phone said it must be a mother board problem and told me he'll send a new MB with a technician next day-  Next day technician called and said he can't make it today.... but he can come tomorrow-  Next day technician arrived and replaced motherboard with a used/refurbished MB ...but issue remained...New diagnosis key board needs replacement- Next WEEK he came back with a used/refurbished keyboard.... ...issue remained....New diagnosis..  It MAY be the housing/case let's send it to depot to check out....- 2 days later Lenovo sends me a box to ship it... I dropped it at ups on same day and lenovo received it 2 days later...-  2 more days later there came an e-mail saying they replaced the mother board again and the case and attached excel with diagnosis report saying everything working.-  I got it back 2 days later and tried to switch on and it gave me a "Fan error"..... and wi wont go beyond bios screen....not cool to send a fake diagnosis report saying everything working.- 2 days later technician came to my home, replace the fan and left ...now the machine working...-  Same day I tried to connect it to the wireless...hmmm Now the wireless not working ....- called Lenovo and they told me to send it back to depot check...I told no way....I paid for onsite next business day support and I want that service ...and then they told me to call back next day between 8am-6pm and ask for issue escalation department- called back earlier today I was told there's no escalation department in Lenovo support..wtf??- Now 3 weeks later after the first issue I'm still waiting for the technician to come and replace wireless card or whatever wrong in there....This is my experience with Lenovo for paying $1500 for a laptop and 300 for onsite next business day support... so will I buy a Lenovo again??? Never.......not even in a dream...If you want to pay premium price for a crappy product with crappy support go for Lenovo....i will update in fewdays to give the latest update..::NSS::1.0::October 24, 2012

RPLCMW84L9ESW::Speed Demon::I've owned a Lenovo T43, T60p, X61T, X200T and now the X220.  Lenovo makes excellent machines.Pros:  Thinkpad Build Quality, Keyboard, HD IPS display, Battery life, Docking station, All day battery sliceCons:  Price for a tricked out modelI purchased the i7 model and then added an after market Intel OEM 300 GB SSD.  This thing flys.  Windows Experience Index is a 6 due to graphics but processor, memory and hard disk (SSD) all score in the mid-7's.  I had heard great things about the IPS display and without a doubt, this is the best computer screen I have ever had.  The resolution could be higher but with my vision it is certainly acceptable.  The viewing angles are fantastic and the screen is bright.As the previous reviewer mentioned, the X220 has a 7 mm drive rather than the standard 9.5 mm.  Intel's 320 series SSD's with models ending in 301 are 7 mm high and come in sizes up to 600 GB.  I used Acronis to clone the hard disk to the SSD, swapped the drives and was up and running in about 2 hours, 1.95 hours of that for the cloning process.I was torn between buying this, a MacBook Air or the Lenovo X1.  The other two may look better but in terms of pure performance, tremendous battery life and the IPS Display the X220 wins out IMO.  Build quality is fantastic.  It may look like the X200 or X201 that came before it but it is a proven succesful design with plenty of power under the hood.  I have absolutely no regrets with this purchase, the X220 is a great machine.::K. Young "PC, OS X, iOS and Chrome User"::5.0::July 29, 2011
R34LD576ANTMTJ::Hard Drive Size Issue!!!::I purchased my X220 from an individual locally.I think it is necessary to post this as a warning.I really like this laptop. The performace is amazing.BIG ISSUE:The hard drive slot height is 7mm. The standard is 9.5mm.Do not expect to buy a standard 2.5" laptop drive (spindle or SSD) and expect it to fit. I usually research before purchasing anything. My bad, didn't even think it would have this height issue.I think Toshiba makes an HG3 series SSD (7mm height) that might just work. Does anyone know of where this can be purchased?Please be aware of this.::DFWScout::5.0::June 10, 2011
R4IXD7SQYFAAO::Better touchpad would give it 5 stars::I like this notebook. It is really well built and a great business notebook with docking and performance. The power to weight ratio is really there and it is a breeze to travel with especially since it has great battery life. However I really do not like the touch pad. No matter how much I try I am not friends with it and it really baffles me that Lenovo put it on there. To me it takes so much value out of the laptop as I make erroneous clicks, scroll by mistake etc.::Magnus Gille::4.0::November 13, 2011
R2RKRWHZBBO22K::Fastest Small Laptop on the Market::I had a Samsung Netbook with the Atom processor that was driving me nuts how slow it was. A good computer for $350, but too slow for my needs doing mostly internet browsing, the processor was always maxed out. This Thinkpad is so fast, much faster then my other 3 computers including a Dell, another older Thinkpad 400 and a HP desktop.For example, to load CNN.com on my old Samsung, it took about 7 seconds, this takes about 1 second. I have Comcast wireless with 50Mbps speed and I get 45Mbps download on this. The dual core processor is very fast for all tasks. The Thinkpad came loaded with Windows 7 Professional, since Im a new to Windows 7 (use Xp on other 3 computers) it has been a learning curve, but I am starting to like it. I found many ways to make it look and feel more like my XP so I am getting more comfortable.Back to the Thinkpad, there are some that criticize the trackpad. I found I had to customize it to stretch out the edge that it uses for detecting movement, that helped a lot as otherwise, I was finding errant selections to happen. It took me an hour or so to play around with the choices, but now it works great and is as good as any laptops pad. The keyboard is amazing also. I really like the light that you can turn on that illuminates the keyboard for working at night in low lights.As for battery, it probably does get about 7-9 hours, but I have the backlit contrast turned all the way up which reduces mine to about 6 hours, anything better then 4 I consider good anyways. As for the screen, it is amazing, so much better then my old netbook. The sound could be better, but I like the volume and on-off buttons on the keyboard that are dedicated to the sound. My old Netbook was a bit lighter, but this is still a notebook weight, but with a full laptop speed (minus a DVD drive), and more, believe me this is a screaming fast machine, amazaing is all I can say.I had some issues with my Symantec Internet Security not fully working, found out that I had to run Internet Explorer 9 in 32 bit mode, not 64, not an issue at all and a call to Symantec took me 2 minutes to change that. The PG UP and PG DN are at the top right, I like them on the lower right of the keyboard so I remapped two keys that are at the lower bottom to move forward and back on web pages, to now be the Pg UP and PG DN keys, it was a freeware program and I love now. The delete key is also in the upper right, but it is a double sized key so I like it now that I am used to it. When I am working and want to put it in sleep mode, I just press the on-off button and it goes right into sleep mode, pressing it again later, it comes back on within 5 seconds, then about 10 seconds more to reconnect to my wireless, very nice.If you want a Netbook sized and weight computer that is more powerful then most laptops and desktops, this is the computer. I did a ton of research and even though this is much more expensive, consider you are getting a full computer with a dual core processor. I ended up getting the 4Gb model and bought another 4Gb (8 total) from Crucial that took me less then 3 minutes to install. If you can afford the higher price, buy this, you won't be sorry as I am extatic about this little lightening fast computer.::M. Dana::5.0::September 10, 2011
R1T0RMH8OMVXGJ::Great machine if it works -- AWFUL Customer SUPPORT::I did my research and decided this was the machine for me -- really attracted to the 8 hour battery life, light weight, keyboard and mid button cursor. Out of the box it did not work -- sent back to Lenovo -- it took me exactly 3 months to the day and escalated it to one level below VP of Customer service for customer service to actually get a new one -- totally outrageous!!! Here's a really joke -- the Executive that I dealt with said that he would send me an internal optical drive for my problems -- they sent it -- guess what -- it doesn't fit an internal drive!!!If you buy the machine get it locally where you can return it and if you notice ANY problems send it back!::Paul L.

R3OOECIGFJTLX6::DO NOT BUY FROM OCEAN REEF ELECTRONICS::While I believe the Lenovo to be a reliable laptop, I am SO angry at being duped by Ocean Reef Electronics. I had a minor problem easily resolved, by Lenovo support, but when I casually asked them to confirm my three-year warranty beginning in April 2012 when I purchased the laptop, their answer astonished and enraged me. Ocean Reef Electronics is not a Lenovo Business Partner so Lenovo will not honor the warranty - at all. When I confronted Ocean Reef Electronics about this problem, here's what they responded. And, since I found out only now, four months after buying the laptop, that Lenovo won't honor the warranty, I can't even buy one from Square Deal because you have to buy it within 90 days of purchasing the laptop. I am SOL. Shame on Amazon for allowing these folks to market on their site.Let this be a warning to everyone - be sure to check warranty info before buying a computer from a third party!From: Ocean Reef Electronics - Amazon Marketplace [mailto:3fjnphl74tw6gvp@marketplace.amazon.com]Sent: Wednesday, August 15, 2012 4:05 PMTo:Subject: Re: RE: USB portDear Valued Customer,Thank you for contacting us.All orders have a 30 day return policy.

R23W5CW8OVFOLO::Touch Pad is garbage...::Overall I like this laptop. This is well build, feels robust, fast and very light.However, I am very disappointed by the mouse pad. I was eager to play with the multi-touch. My girl friend has a MacBook Pro and her touch pad is just amazing with the multi-touch.Unfortunately, the multi-touch on the Lenovo is just garbage... For example with the 2 fingers scrolling, it is not responsive, doesn't do anything when I move slowly or scroll directly to the top/bottom of the page when I move just a little too fast. This is just unusable to me... This just amazes me to see Lenovo putting such an unfinished feature on the market... Thankfully I do not mind using the track point but I am very disappointed... I took 2 stars off because of the poor experience.That might very well be my last Thinkpad...::Paco::3.0::March 1, 2012
R1HE97YC7NDBTV::great portable laptop::I wanted something that would be better for air travel and travel in general while still having great functionality. This is an amazing little laptop, so much power is so little space. If you like a big screen you'll hate it but I've had it for 6 months and while I mostly use it on trips I have no complaints. I bought the extended battery for really long trips in additional to having the standard battery for the shorter times away from the house. While many people complained about the touch pad and even I worried about it in the beginning I've gotten used to it and now adore it. Some of my pros and cons will depend on what specs you purchase but they will include my favorites even if they don't apply to your purchase.pros (there are too many to name...)- a usb 3.0 port- always on power usb capabilities- plenty of ports- textured touch pad- many different options for using the touch pad- thumb print reader- integrated mic and camera- plenty of space for wrists and curved/small form factor allows for comfortable resting space on whatever surface underneath- even though it's a small laptop the keyboard is still very manageable, granted I have small hands, I don't think someone with large hands could use it but I don't have any trouble- like all ThinkPads it's very sturdy, I actually dropped the thing not long after I got it (even though I've never once dropped a laptop) and while I did get a tiny split in the corner no internal damage was done- the little over screen light is convenient when you need to plug something in or see something while you are on a plane and trying not to disturb those around youcons- as all Lenovos are...the FN key is where the ctrl key should be, grr, I've gotten used to it but it's different from almost every keyboard in the world- it does have a very small screen but if you shell out the money for the nicer display it's worth it- should have gone all out and bought the SSD, I've heard it's completely amazing with this laptop; I'm more than happy with the hard drive in it but it would have been cool- some of my capabilities like the powered usb port was not enabled when I bought it, I figured all that would be on by default but I had to go into the bios and turn it on, no big deal just confused me- if you purchase the extended battery it doubles the weight of the little laptop- honestly...I know it's in the logo but why not option out the touch stick?So as you can tell, my cons are pretty silly and either opinionated or preference. It's a great little laptop and easily the best purchase I've made in a laptop at any given time.::jex "- - jex"::5.0::December 23, 2011
R1IU574X1RBWZ0::Lenovo thinkpad x220::I LOVE my new lenovo laptop!! It is super lightweight and portable. I had a dell with a 14" screen before this and so I was a little worried about the difference in screen sizes. But this has been a perfect replacement! My favorite thing about this laptop is the battery life. On the high performance setting this computer lasts about 6 hours!! The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a dvd-rom drive. I did not know this when I purchased it and thought about returning it. But before I could send it back I fell in love with it, and I have been loving it ever since! Would definitely recommend this laptop!!::Amber::4.0::October 28, 2011
R2TTYGLEGRE2DK::Acer Netbook - prolems!!!::I have not contacted Ocean reef electronics directly yet.  The laptop came with an UNCHARGED battery and no Wifi connectivity (had to charge and load myself).  Additionally, after having made proper sensitivity adjustments the cursor is STILL jumping BACK into the body of whatever I am typing WHILE I am typing (ANNOYING!). It happens on sticky notes, gmail and and word starter. I have owned a previous ACER, same model, so it's NOT 'operator error'. I am told I MAY need a new mouse driver loaded AND/OR an entire new cursor (cost is HUGE because you have to replace the entire BASE of the ACER). I am well within 30day return, but JUST want a functional unit. Worried about other negative reviews. What up, Amazon and OCEAN REEF??::CarrieK::1.0::October 12, 2013
RP14GD4S7TNHK::Great Tablet ... Unless It's a Gorilla::I just got this tablet after 4 1/2 years with a x61s touchscreen capable tablet. I LOVED that machine, ready for something faster. I ordered my x220 direct from lenovo after being told the outdoor, gorilla glass screen is multi-touch -- two-finger instead of the five-finger alternate display. GORILLA GLASS ON THIS TABLET SUCKS. I've already tendered my return and have another with the standard display coming. Not only is the gorilla glass screen NOT touch-enabled (yes, this is a tablet! odd since the sales guy was so specific about the two vs. five finger thing) but the pen is extremely slick and very difficult to use -- you can't select anything long enough to drag, move, right click or, often, select. The damn pen tip keeps moving! I compared the pen "feel"  to my old x61 with the standard (touch) screen ... no problems with the pen, tracks and holds well. Finger is the bomb, selects anything.  Thumbs up for the x220 tablet (if you have the i7, anyway, this is the only tablet with it as far as I know), but not with the glass display.::Prime4Me::4.0::December 12, 2011
R1NA7TV1Z4XAYN::good looking laptop, DP (not HDMI) is real issue::First the Good: this is a well made, good looking laptop. battery life is pretty good.Now the Bad: Touchpad is not good at all. Display port to HDMI conversion is not fully functional. You may get video but audio is not. Have tried 3 different adapters. None of them worked.Finally the Ugly: Tech support. Took over 4 hrs, but couldn't resolve this issue and advised me to go to best-buy to get it fixed or just return the laptop.::Mukesh Nyati::3.0::December 9, 2011
R2TG0SZJ2ZIM08::Good laptop, bad fan, poor customer service::I bought this laptop straight from lenovo and was quite happy with everything except for the fact that the fan makes a high pitched whine when doing normal activities such as browsing the internet. I called Lenovo and they sent me a box to ship the laptop back to them for repairs. It has now been three weeks and I still don't have my laptop back.The laptop is a nice piece of work. Looks nice, awesome battery, awesome IPS screen.The trackpad isn't as great as the trackpad I have on my T410 and it is a little small, but this is understandable because of the limited room available. I use the red nub for the most part anyways.I'm reviewing this purchase as 2 out of 5 stars because of a pretty widespread fan issue that other x220 owners have also experienced and the experience I have had with Lenovo customer service. Lenovo was quick to send me a repair box, but this repair time is ridiculous. If they have a shortage of parts they should of just sent me a new laptop.My Specs:i5-2410m12.5'' ips screenbluetoothfingerprint reader9 cell batterycamera320gb hd2gb ram::skimmilk::2.0::August 6, 2011
R33KV9CBM92PT3::Great Design, Poor Performance::I really, really wanted to like this computer. I've owned over a dozen Thinkpads over the years. I use a T420 as my work machine, and this was going to be a game/movie/kid-safe machine. It has exactly the same CPU, memory and graphics as my T420, and the exact same keyboard and controls, which I really liked.However, this is the little machine that couldn't. I noticed right away that the screen was significantly dimmer than my T420, even with all the power settings maxed out. If I put the X220 on maximum brightness (15), it is the same as the T420 on level 11 or 12, in other words much dimmer and washed out. Same for the volume. Max volume (50) on the X220 is the same as around 30 on the T420. To be fair, the T420 has much larger speakers.But the real problem is the graphics. The X220, even with the second-generation I5 Core chip, just can't handle HD graphics. I tried it with Netflix, YouTube, and even Quicktime, and it stutters and chokes on all three. Even worse, when I play a child's game (nothing fancy), the four CPU's go to 90%, the fan shoots to high, and *really* hot air comes flying out of the vent.In short, this puppy really needs a graphics card. I had hoped that the Intel 3000 would be an improvement over the old 2000, but apparently not.Again, I really hated to send this guy back, but for almost $1000, I expected a machine that could zip through a Spongebob video without breaking a sweat. This isn't that machine. Sorry!::Brian Battuello::2.0::April 11, 2012

R1SDN0V4GYR1C0::Great, Solid Machine::Pretty great laptop. Had no issue whatsoever with the screen like another reviewer said, worked great since day 1 for half a year now. Also installed linux ubuntu 11.10 on it, works like a charm - the multitouch on the touchpad in ubuntu also runs great (there's a debian package for that). It's strong, powerful, and despite its tank-like build it's not as heavy as you'd expect. A friend has an older model of the series and 5 years later and a cup of coffee on the keyboard and it still works great.::Alexandru B. Georgescu::5.0::December 24, 2011
R3JR8V9ON1DI57::Decent, but with limitations::I'm working on a degree in Computer Science and needed a laptop with good processing capability.  After doing some research on the processors out there (I wanted at least an Intel I5), this laptop looked like a good choice for my price-point criteria.  It does have good number crunching capabilities, but when I set up a mysql database on it and ran a database intensive program it maxed out the disk drive access (this is easy to monitor in Ubuntu).  When I checked the programs running the database queries, I found they were using only small percentage of available CPU power.  In other words, this laptop seems to have some IO limitations that keep it from making full use of the CPU (in some applications).Outside of the IO bottleneck the laptop does fine.  The bezel is a bit wide, making the effective screen space smaller, but the screen resolution is decent.  As long as my eyes can make out the smaller fonts it is workable.  The built in webcam and microphone work well.  I tried training the speech recognition software in Windows 7 using the built in mics and it did OK.  Perhaps I can use that later to dictate my dissertation...All in all, I am fairly pleased with the laptop.  I spent some time optimizing the database to see if that will help relieving the disk access limitations.  We'll see how that works.::Jeff::3.0::March 19, 2012

Everything arrived as described but almost a week early. ( it was a good thing because my wife was still angry that I didn't pay extra to get "her" computer expedited.)The seller communicated excellent.The product was in better condition than described.The processing was better than I could have imaginedI never write reviews especially for a purchase that just would be average, but this seller earned 5 stars and I'm keeping an eye on the offerings as I will purchase from them again::Jeff Brown::5.0::April 16, 2014
R5RETDVMNJVT8::Business first::Been using this laptop for over a year now, and it has been rock solid. Great battery life and no hard drive issues. It runs applications quickly whether in Ubuntu 12.x, Windows 7, or even Windows 8. All have run great and without problems. I appreciate the simplicity of the system since it is primarily for business - Office applications, browsing, and email. But there is still plenty of power to work in Photoshop, Lightroom, or other photo/video editing software. Gaming is limited by the built-in graphics card, but I'm sure you could find a few goodies to play on it. The primary downside of the system is the screen resolution - 1366x768. So be sure to get the HD+ which permits 1600x900.It also runs a bit hot, but remains silent even when the fans are working hard.Overall, an aging, but still solid, choice for your business needs and/or limited media work.::Xina143::4.0::March 25, 2013
R15ICUHI68CR3P::Garbage at a high price::Once again, Dell forsakes quality for .... nothing.Immediately on receiving the machine, I had problems with:1. the screen not working properly;2. fingerprint reader not working and no drivers installed;3. headphone jack not working in stereo.After a total of five hours on the line to the incompetent, nonchalant, rude people (who could not understand English) at the call centre, they eventually sent someone round to fix it.  The person who arrived had never looked in their database of solutions and appeared not to know much more than me.  After three visits and replacement of parts (some twice) Dell eventually agreed to replace the machine, but would not help me move my data across.Despite Dell's not having a clue about the screen problem, a simple Google search revealed this has been a known issue for more than 5 years! So much for Dell's service database.As a business-level machine, this Latitude E6420 was not cheap, yet the entire experience was cheap. Dell has chosen to compete using the worst quality parts, cheapest labour and lowest standards of service. Garbage in, garbage out.The fortunate thing about this experience was that I was testing the machine for a corporate purchase to move all our machines from ThinkPads. We now have a corporate policy that no Dell equipment will be permitted in our office.I wrote two reviews on Dell's website. Neither was published. Dell is censoring their website to prevent you knowing how bad their products are.Don't get caught. Avoid Dell's garbage. Buy something else.::Floccinaucinihilipilification::1.0::August 26, 2011
R1KD2GTQDDXDQO::The fatal flaws are right under your nose...::This computer is what it says it is and so far it does what it claims it will do HOWEVER...1. It doesn't have a built in camera, so no skype video.  Never even thought to look.  I assumed wrongly that such things were standard these days.2. It doesn't have any system for lighting the keyboard.  Again, most computers don't brag about it but they have some method of lighting the keyboard in the dark.Most people will either have a social life and want skype or will be stuck home at night and want a lit keyboard.  In the event you don't need either there is one final flaw that for me tips this computer over the edge into the "fatally flawed category".3. This mouse track-pad is truly awful.  Usually you can adjust your hands slightly and get used to it.  Maybe I'm getting old, but I simply can't.  OH - that's the final kick in the teeth with this machine.  Apparently there is no way of disabling the track-pad.  It features both the IBM-button in the middle of the key board and the track-pad and no way to disable either as far as I can tell.  In theory, if you are hacker you can rewrite some code in the bios-sphere somewhere - or if you prefer hardware you can open the machine and physically unplug it.  Probably, programmers and hackers would already know enough to avoid this machine.::Ball Point "Jason"::2.0::June 13, 2013
R2NQ9V3VKDD1JU::great computer !!!::my wife purchased this computer at wal-mart a week ago. i have to say i'm real surprised, first at the price at second at what a great buy it was. it was on sale for $358.00. the setup was easy and the computer is really a pleasant surprise. it is very fast and has a lot of options i like in a computer. we decided on an acer after she bought me an acer notebook for my birthday last year. it too is a really great computer. this laptop was only $59.00 more than my notebook. i'm by no means an expert on computers, but for what we will need it for, it will be great. i highly recommend this to anyone who really knows their way around a computer. i'm not one for doing really precise and long reviews, but take my word for it, you would love this computer. i'm sure many morereviews will come up on this computer than will go into greater detail than i have, but from my own experience with it, I LOVE IT !!!!!::Laura S.

RI2A1741GO678::Great Machine::Had a few reservations about the slow cpu speed - but it had all the other things i needed - HDMI was the most important.  I was very pleasantly suprised - after loading office and a lot of other software - the machine didn't seem all that much slower than my 1,700$ corporate laptop.  And it ran a LOT cooler - matter of fact it is downright cool.  This replaces a 399 Black Friday laptop that the cat loved - it kept her quite warm.Perfect for a personal travel laptop - and something to surf the web and email from the couch in the LivingRoom.::Syd Kahn "Elder Geek"::5.0::April 25, 2011
RY5CQIG0QFKWV::Pretty good.::I got it at Walmart on sale in early April. My main purpose was getting a faster computer with more hard drive (had a 4 year old Toshiba laptop with half a gigabyte RAM and 80GB hard drive) and hopefully playing Sims 3. It plays Sims 3 great unfortunately it doesn't seem to play Sims Medieval. I can be on it for hours (and hours and hours) and it barely even feels warm no cooling pad required.Update: The DVD Drive stoped working about a month ago. A little over a year after getting it of course.::Karissa "music"::4.0::June 1, 2011
R1YSZO77PIDT2T::Great value::I'm very pleased with this computer, especially considering its price (I got it for $300 at Walmart in April). It's not the fastest or most powerful, but it does what I need it to do. It has a nice wide screen, plenty of hard drive space, and a decent amount of RAM. It is not great for PlayOn video service if that matters to you. The HDMI out is great.Cons: You will probably need an external speaker, as the internal ones are weak.All the port connections; USB, HDMI, power, are on the sides. I'd prefer them them on the back.Not much power.Touch pad is awkward, at least for me. Only one button which is difficult to locate and press. I use an external mouse.Poor audio speakers.Pros: Excellent price.Large hard drive.Nice screen.Runs cool.Decent battery life.Nice keyboard, which includes number keypad.Summary: If you can live with its weaknesses, it is a good value and I'm glad I bought it.::Teri::4.0::August 10, 2011

Last night, I received a HDD/SMART failure message,Its game over for your HDD once that happens, it can not be repaired, the only option is to buy a new HDD.  I decided against that, and purchased a new laptop (not a Toshiba) because quite frankly, I am not impressed with this crap computer.

R211H4VE6R543N::Would Rate Negative if I Could::This is my last and final toshiba. It has been nothing but trouble. Turning it on to Windows usually results in going directly to BIOS. Then play around to find out what I need to do to open Windows. cannot shutdown or restart without receiving fatal errors. I am now running out to buy an external hard drive because Windows cannot back-up and I now have a warning that my internal harddrive is about to crash and I need to back-up to an external drive. I have done all the fixes Toshiba has put out. Toshiba shows a healthy hard drive....wrong. I have an alert that says:Your HDD has the SMART Predict Failure function which monitors the HDD operating status. Your HDD is experiencing a problem and SMART monitoring software predicts that the HDD will fail. Toshiba strongly recommends you create a back-up for your HDD data. Then contact an authorized service provider in order to check your drive and purchase a new replacement drive if necessary. Apparently a lot of the machines have this problem from the updates or fixes I have been sent. Piece of crap!!!!!!!!!The crackling/stuttering sound is almost constant. BBuy should be shamed for recommending this when it first came out. I HATE IT.My tech guy said I'd have to call Toshiba and send it to them for repairs. For a teacher, this is a disaster.UPDATE:10/21/2011 Sent it back to Toshiba. Had problem taking delivery because Toshiba wanted a signature. The hours of delivery were during my work week. I wasn't going to drive 50 miles round trip to the nearset pick-up facility. Fortunately FEDEX was willing to deliver at night. The computer is working well, but the sound is starting to screech again. Having to download my Microsoft Office, Nuance, iTunes and all the other programs again was a hassle. Now I have to pick thru my files to restore them.::SJohnson "SJ"::1.0::September 18, 2011
R8WN0F62O10GQ::Overheating problems::Hello I have had this computer for about three years now and I have noticed several irritating things about this laptop. This can include the annoying overheating and the loss of function in certain keys at random. This has a two star rating because of the ok (but not great processing power and ability to run games). I would recommend not buying this product. Please listen to this review.::Joseph Santoro::2.0::June 16, 2013
R367WGCKJ0SED4::Is there a negative star rating? That's what it needs.::CRAP CRAP CRAP. *laptop was purchased at Best Buy in early February 2011*Listen up, folks. If you're having the same issues I've been having with this PC (Piece of Crap), go to Toshiba like I did. If they don't respond (like how it happened to me), give them notice that if they don't take steps to solve the matter, you will contact the Better Business Bureau in your area to kick start a settlement (like I did).If they contact you after you file your formal BBB complaint and you still have not reached a proper settlement (complete refund for the lemon and all its costly repairs) select the option to file another complaint.Then, contact your retailer (Best Buy). Let them know what's up. Send them screen shots and the link to this forum so they can see for themselves what a hunk of junk this laptop actually is.Look up your state Lemon Law and how it pertains to electronics. Contact your area representative telling them every step you've taken thus far and that you need to bring attention to Toshiba's crappy service. And a proper settlement.Regardless if you're out of warranty, if you've pursued the matter since it began in 2011, that issue becomes irrelevant.We need our voices to be heard on this company's faulty product and lack of customer service! Don't just think it's your tiny little voice versus an entire company!As part of the recognized one percent, we deserve proper customer service from a globally involved company. Not some lame excuse saying to take it back to the store and pay for repairs that shouldn't be needed.I encourage you to take this review and put it to good use! My fight has been months in the making, and being a student, I need a reliable laptop! I will NOT stop until the issue is resolved in a way I see fit!::Kiersten::1.0::August 8, 2013
R1BTMV2NO1MZQA::Where do I start?::The first one I bought crashed after not even having it for a month and I had to send it to Toshiba for it be given a new hard drive. Now.. it just shuts off by itself.  The power cord doesn't work and the battery is bad. I've had this computer less than three years and it is CRAP! Worse spend money ever.::Carla Goff::1.0::March 2, 2013
R1PTTQP4YPTENE::TOSHIBA SATELLITE A665-S5170::I too bought my A665-S5170 in February of 2011- my laptop is now 44 days out of warranty- I got it from BestBuy which of course they just wash there hands of the whole Hard Drive crashing- my issues also started in December as well- I took it to an independant repair shop- for about $200.00 I'm having a new hard drive installed :(I will never buy another Toshiba again !!! Ever! Not to mention their customer service must be off shore, can't understand any of them. I currently have a case open, but of course they aren't open on weekends-How convenient :(When I purchase another laptop, I will go back to Gateway... great customer service, even if you are out of warranty...It's pretty sad when a $700.00 laptop doesn't last over 12 months before having issues-And the star "1" is more than what they deserve.::Nance In AZ::1.0::April 7, 2012
R2MW91DCPEO7ZN::Problems::This item is no longer being sold new online (at least on Amazon) so I'm writing this review for people who may be able to purchase this in-store. I recommend you do NOT buy it.I bought this laptop from Best Buy in February 2011, just like another reviewer did. Now it's December and this thing is failing. It started shutting off at random times. It wouldn't start up Windows once and when I finally was able to log in, I had to reinstall some programs/updates. Now a popup says that Windows has detected a problem with the hard disk and I should backup the computer with an external hard drive or flash drive in order to not lose anything. So basically, I have to spend over seventy dollars in order to buy something with enough GB to backup my entire system and if this things fails (which it probably will any day now) I'll still have to buy another new hard drive (over eighty bucks) and then reupload the backup while reinstalling a bunch of software (which may cost more money). I'm tempted just to buy a new laptop and that shouldn't happen at all within a year. I've lost a bit of faith in Toshiba. This thing looks beast and has a decent webcam and is pretty fast but within 10 - 11 months, it started dying. I could lose all of my data within the next few days. I contacted Best Buy and am waiting to see what they can do.But really if this thing crashes before I can buy something to back it up (and/or if Best Buy does nothing), my music, pictures, videos, Word documents, just everything will be lost. Toshiba never should have put out a product that would destroy stored up memories and files that had to be purchased. This was just a waste of money really. I spent over seven hundred dollars and before the year ended, I was left with an unreliable piece of metal that could go out any day. I keep this thing on for days on end now since if I shut it down, it'll take forever (or possibly never) turn on again and I will have lost it all.So I'm done with my little anti - Toshiba rant but won't diss the brand completely. Just be wary. I'm giving this thing one star on account of the fact that this product can end up completely useless/unreliable within the first 12 months of purchase. I'm going to look at Sony Vaios now...My mother's lasted over 3 years...::Noah::1.0::December 21, 2011
R1KDNWK8QW7P1R::Would also give this negative stars if possible::Purchased this Toshiba in February from BB.  After a week had to take it back for a new one as the volume button was stuck on a constant beeping sound and would not stop unless you hit mute.New laptop ran well for a month then immediately became bogged down.  The Toshiba proprietary support software is an albatross - clicking on the update request or message balloons hung the computer up constantly.  Much like the previous reviewer I started getting the HDD failure notices.  Eventually the laptop had to go back to Toshiba's repair depot and now they are missing a part and my service is delayed so I've been without a working computer for over a month now.Would not recommend Toshiba computer products to anyone...::RL Jr "RLL"::1.0::December 1, 2011
R2U136CWWZMN7C::HDD Problems::It's been a good three years with this computer, but recently I was given the warning that my HDD was failing. I've personally never dropped my computer in the 3 years that I've had it so this was quite the surprise to me.Pros: It worked wonders over the three years that I used it. It's crazy fast despite the fact that I had several games downloaded on it (WoW, LoL, Rift, etc.). I keep good care of it and luckily have never ran into any viruses. The Harman/Kardon speakers work fantastic and the keyboard is very well put together. It even has a number pad if you're looking for that sort of thing. I've never had a problem with my connection and more often than not, I am amazed at the power exhibited from this machine. Once it's up and running, it's performance is truly incredible. Most likely, that's all thanks to the powerful processor inside. It's a 640 GB computer with about 582 GB free. Surprisingly, despite all of the huge MMO files I've kept on it over the years, memory has never been an issue. You could literally keep anything on this computer and memory will never cross your mind.Cons: Overheating is a huge issue for me in the summer. My work space can sometimes reach up to 90 degrees. I realize that asking a computer to work properly in such a hot room seems like a bit much, but I know of plenty of other computers that would work perfectly fine in the situation. It's also pretty heavy (10 pounds), but considering the dimensions, I can't imagine portability is your goal if you plan on buying this computer. The plastic exterior is not all too appealing or reassuring if you are afraid that you might drop it. When I put it in my bag it often clicks around because it does not have any lock-shut technology when you put the screen down.The biggest problem of all though is with the HDD. I have no clue how or why I received my HDD/SMART failure message, but after two years and six months, my lap top had finally had it. It took me about 30 minutes to power on my computer after I began to receive this message. After messing around with my BIOS, deleting a majority of programs on my computer changing start up programs that ran, deleting my wallpaper, and defragmenting it I've finally reduced my start up time to about 7 minutes 30 seconds. It used to be only a few seconds. The best way to get around this problem is to just never turn it off and only put it into sleep mode. I assume that buying a new HDD may be a solution to this issue, but I can't be sure. I don't think I will ever buy another computer with HDD again. SSD seems like the way to go if you fear this problem ever happening to you.Despite the long start up time it is still an unbelievably strong computer. I would recommend it in every other field. If I never had this HDD problem, then despite the massive size, I would give this computer a 5/5. It has treated me well over the years, and ran quickly on ever online game I've played and downloaded on it. It's reliable in every other field. I never had any other problems, and if a new HDD can fix it, I greatly recommend you buy one so that you can replace it.::Julian Ward::3.0::December 24, 2013
R1GU8SVVZ7P1Z3::Pretty decent for a casual pc experience::got this computer in February also, from Best Buy... it did crash four months after I got it, but I'm really starting to believe its what Best Buy did when they up load software ,( that way Geek squad is always bring in the dough! Lol)on it such as my Microsoft Office suite. I don't think that's a coincidence we all got our laptops from Best Buy around the same time and had the same problem. it was still under warranty so it was fixed return pretty fast and was fine ever since. this is my fifth laptop and I have no real complaints. however I'm bored with it now and I want to upgrade, see it's not good with Windows 8.::lilc::4.0::January 18, 2013
RXYOQ3F799RLS::Terrible Keyboard::I haven't had any problems others' have been writing about. The laptop has never had a system failure or any software problems. However, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this model unless you don't mind using a different keyboard, but to me that defeats the purpose of a laptop. I've had issues with the R button, then it started to work again on its own and the the N button went. I have to push down on it just to get the key to register.::kyraxamber::1.0::December 28, 2011
R28GE6RRJO4BUM::Terriffic::Before I bought the laptop I read many reviews.. none of which were good ones. But despite the many bad reviews I bought it anyway.. and it didn't disappoint. I love it. Had it for over a month now and I still haven't had a problem.. very nice laptop. Do not listen to the bad reviews this thing is awesome.::scheuvront1993::5.0::May 8, 2012
RISQ7KAVDTSWT::don't stick with the windows version::i was given this laptop as a gift when i turned 15 i am almost 17(less than a week) now. afew months after i got the laptop it crashed completely so i thought itwas a pos but i then installed ubuntu 13.04 a yr after. i then heard of the ubuntu program downloaded it on to my usb and after a few hours of running between pc's to get the files correct (i suggest to burn the iso NOT the usb way) i finally got the laptop up and running like new, If you buy this pc i highly suggest putting ubuntu or some linux program on it then download wine off of winehq by opening terminal then typesudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa type your password to your laptop after it is done type sudo apt-get update wait for it to install then lastly install wine by typing sudo apt-get install wine1.5 after that is done you can run almost any windows program/game if there is any questions post a comment or drop me a email at underwood103a@gmail.com::Underwood103::4.0::July 14, 2013
R386KX8VRPDIOL::Hard Drive Crash::This computer hard drive died 20days before the warranty ran out..thank God.  We used it lightly and it doesn't seem like it should have crashed at all!  can't believe they make such fragile lap top computers....if it was a desk top, I could understand.  Lap tops should be able to be moved without an issue!  What a bunch of junk.  My gateway lasted for 5 years with rough wear and tear.Never buy Toshiba.::M. Gibson::2.0::September 18, 2012
R315W2I70I1JQS::Toshiba Satellite A665-S5170::I like this model, its worth for the price. I bought one from bestbuy and it is working very good. only the thing is weight, it is 6.5 lbs. other than that I recommend this product to anyone want to use for daily life.::zion::5.0::October 18, 2011
R16ELAS84XQZTP::Great!::I got this laptop from a friend that came to me from his workplace, I have upgraded to 8GB of RAM and a 240GB Intel SATA III SSD. After that this laptop became magic. I render fractals in Apophysis, songs in Fruity Loops Studio, and videos in Microsoft Movie Maker and can multitask between rendering fractals and a song OR a video and running flash and other processes. I don't have any hiccups in performance and I leave almost everything open. I use two browsers with multiple tabs open. This laptop's processor kicks butt!!!! It doesn't even overheat on a hot day while using it with load.I had to buy a brick for this one, because it was missing. It wasn't the original laptop's brick I bought, but a generic one from the local store. It supports 85Ws. It uses quite a bit under that and this usage and the awesomeness of the processor plus the upgrades makes it desirable over a desktop computer, because of it's size and low wattage usage. I'm really surprised!The downside is the graphics, I can not play Morrowind TES III more than with just bare minimum graphics. I had to wait for minecraft to update in order to play it with medium graphics.I had an issue with the drivers for my wireless and wired. I can not use my wired at all! When my wireless adapter knocked loose, I could use my wired again, but as soon as I put it back in, the wired stops working.I also wish it had SDHC support!Overall, the processor, the wattage usage, and in addition to the upgrades, this laptop is great for everything necessary to compute other than gaming. I use my laptop on a TV table and an office chair, but when I have more space in my room, I'm going to hook up my TV to it which I did before and enjoy having a second screen.Enjoy!::Amber Killion::4.0::May 6, 2013
RCL6R8IZAVQWE::Can't upgrade to Windows 8::I had been previously satisfied with the Satellite A665-S5170 until Windows 8 was released. Tried to upgrade it and it kept on failing. Called Microsoft and they said I needed a bios update from Toshiba, called Toshiba and was told that this model can't be upgraded to windows 8. The laptop is only slightly over a year old and running windows 7. Was told that there is now Bios update that will allow this machine to be upgraded to windows 8. Really sucks!!!!!!!!::Norman L.

I received the pc on 6/24/11 and so far it's shut down at least once a day, even when I only use it for casual personal use.  Yesterday it shut down 3 times.  If it wasn't for this issue I would be happy with the pc, but these shutdowns are a deal breaker.  DO NOT BUY::Silver Spring Customer::1.0::July 2, 2011
RKJ8VUYT32CR::HP 630 CONSTANT THERMAL SHUTDOWNS::Beware of HP 630I have experienced THERMAL SHUTDOWNS constantly when using this notebook.The matte screen is the most appealing thing about it.The screen corrupts and then the fan gets really loud suddenly.It can't be overheating. I have no clue what is wrong with these notebooks, but they all seem to have the same problem.I don't think you can trust HP notebooks. They do not have quality designs. They always have problems.STAY AWAY FROM HP NOTEBOOKS.::Austin Outland::1.0::June 30, 2011
R2NZTXZWARDPHY::The worst product ever!::I deliberately took my time before coming up with this review just so I'd have time to know the type of product I was dealing with. Here's my well-analyzed review of this laptop: This product, by far, is the WORST computer that anyone can ever use!!! And I say this with substantial fact.First of all, the inferior hardware is evident. It's made of low quality plastic material that gives it a fake toy appearance. The keyboard is a write-off! Just like the rest of the other parts, it's made of cheap plastic that looks very oily on touch, even if your hands are dry and ashy. In addition to this, the letters and symbols on the keys look just like an amateur's messy painting. That's for the keyboard.Now, on to the USB. The USB ports are the worst ever! The first time you insert any USB plug into it, it will feel like putting a square peg in a round hole. You'll practically wrestle with it just to get the USB cable in. Now, this is one of my true experiences with this inferior-quality product. Pulling the USB out, after successfully wrestling with the USB port on entry, is just as hard as pushing it in. The very first time I pushed my wireless mouse key into one of the USBs (this was the very first time I used this port), it got stuck. I tried every maneuver I could think of to get it out, but all my efforts were futile. Finally, I called hp customer care and they provided me with a repairs center address where I took the computer to for the USB to be freed. Although they succeeded in removing the wireless mouse key, I lost the key. To free the key, they had to break it off. So, the repair cost me my wireless key and consequently resulted in me spending more money to replace the mouse.Let's move on to the CAP lock key. The CAP Lock key has a tiny indicator light on it that shows the mode (Upper case or Lower case) in use. This light comes on when it feels like it. In other words, it has a mind of its own. Therefore, it makes it frustrating to toggle between both modes. Imagine where you have to enter passwords several times because the Cap Lock malfunctions. Re-booting doesn't even fix this issue.Finally, the in-built mouse is badly designed. The buttons are flush with the edge of the computer, which results in accidental button punch. Most computers, are designed with these two buttons positioned at lease one inch from the edge of the computer. The solution to this is locking the mouse before use, and attaching an external mouse. But, does one have to buy a mouse? I think the owner should be allowed the freedom to use what he/she desires; this bad design imposes the use of an external mouse on the user, which I perceive as terrible.The long and short of my review and warning is for you to change your mind right this moment if you're planning on buying this dismal toy!! Don't waste your time and money. Just don't buy it!!!::Felix C. Eneh "Galaxy"::1.0::November 27, 2011
RT9HGWYO78JXV::piece of garbage::Ordered the HP630 notebook.  After 3 months, while in the middle of watching a movie, I got a random screen display.  I tried to reboot it but couldn't get it to shut down at all.  I even took out the battery but still it wouldn't truly shut down.  Called HP and they said send it back.  got a call today that I had an internal pressure crack on the LCD!  Price to repair $300+ for a $400 computer!Customer service said it was my fault.::Robert A.

R3VX4HUMZX45U::HP 630 Shutdowns::I am having the same problem, first screen corruption, then the fan goes full blast, then shutdown.  Reboot says shutdown due to thermal conditions.  The last thing I need is another computer with a problem.7/5/11 UPDATE - It seems that this computer is very sensitive to the type of memory added to it.  I pulled the extra memory that I added and the computer has been rock stable.  I am sending the extra memory back to the supplier as I believe it is the wrong speed.  Just FYI for anybody having problems with shutdown, check the memory.::Skip::5.0::July 1, 2011

R2KYERLRPY1XAT::Thermal Shutdown never ends::Laptop is elevated, has a cooling system underneath and no dust clogging anything. I've even used another program to clock the temperature and the laptop keeps giving me a scrambled screen then does a shutdown. It's amazing the number of complaints I've seen online about this model, but HP still refuses to admit there's a problem. I've been using their HP Assistant to download all the new drivers and bios updates, nothing helps.::Hjug::1.0::December 25, 2011
R25QDG309Q0WH2::Never been more disappointed::Take your money and run. The thermal shutdowns happen at least once a day. Average is about 2 or 3 times and I've had days where it would shut down 10 times. It even shuts down when I am at the LOGIN SCREEN for Windows. Please, do yourself a big favor and save your (or your family's) hard earned cash. Go buy another laptop. Buy new clothes. Take your family out to eat at a fancy restaurant. Buy your girlfriend that necklace or whatever. JUST DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I found out about the thermal shutdowns after I bought it and had played around with it. I thought I was going to be fine since I could just restart the laptop. WRONG. Try doing that seven times in one hour while writing a paper. Unbelievable!!!::Imsoazn::1.0::January 22, 2013
R3CM6TJ2SXZS20::Very BAD ****::This is simply the WORST laptop that I have ever purchased!  Of at least a dozen units, this is the ONE computer with the MOST problems.  Now, the LEFT button on the Touch Pad has failed - the electronics, not just the plastic cover.  There is little to cure this, so the 630 is headed for the scrap heap and HP is doomed to never enter my home again.  This is horrible, unreliable, slow, poorly built!  Get it?  Don't buy it... ever!::Amazon Customer::1.0::November 24, 2012

R1VNL2A3ZCMG8R::Beware of Thermal Shutdowns::Like a moron, I decided to press my luck when purchasing this machine. I got in for less than $300 on July 8, 2011 and it was ok. My thermal shutdowns occur at least three times a day. At first, I just saved my work often so I didn't lose anything. It has become unbearable over time. I think I'll have to get another laptop before I go crazy with this one. It's a great product when it works. The problem, of course, is that it doesn't work as well as it should. HP doesn't seem to be on top of the issue, either. You really have to search high and low to find a remedy. I'm sure that based on the other reviews I read (and, sadly, ignored), many are having problems with the 630.Do not buy this product. The aggravation is not worth the saving you get on any great deal.::Tapper65::2.0::November 3, 2011
R3E421UPJ1WM18::Not Happy::We looked into just what we wanted for a computer and then asked the advise of a (our) computer repairman (who is very good) on just what we needed and he gave us three computers (laptops) to pick from. I guess we picked the wrong one, because we are having the same heat shut down as all the other reviews. Like others, it is less than four months old and we are working with or Service Person on just how to deal with this problem. We have yet to hear anything from HP on this problem.::Onset::1.0::October 5, 2011

Upon restarting I get the thermal shutdown message. I updated the bios and made sure to keep laptop elevated off desk as to allow good airflow but it still shuts down. I will be contacting hp but reading reviews on the internet,,it seems they don't want to admit there is a problem with this model. That is probably why they sold it at such a cheap price.::A.

R3AG85U5IK6FW8::Powerful Laptop. Tech has come a loooong way... :D::I bought this laptop directly from HP with slightly different specs. I only got 1gb of ram for the GPU, the steel case, and a 1080p screen. My 750gig hard drive is a 7200rpm. I wonder what the one in this laptop is because they don't feel like specifying... :PBloatware wasn't that bad, the speed of this laptop made going through that process reaaally fast. I'm a DJ/Producer and this laptop handles Traktor and Ableton without a hitch. Its just amazing. :DI work at a computer repair shop and I find it ironic that I bought a dv6 even after I've seen 30+ dv6000s from 3-4 years ago with bad motherboards. :D I just hope that trend doesn't carry over with complete redesigns... :DThis is a relevantly new laptop, so no one can speak on longevity, but with tech progressing like it is, life expectancy should only go up. :) If your looking for a high end PC for a little over a grand, this is a great place to start.Amazon might decide to edit my comment for me saying this, but consider buy directly from HP, you WILL wait at least 2 weeks for your laptop to arrive, but for me its worth it. :D You get exactly what you want. For me I really wanted the 1080p screen. :P::Anthony Gomulka "Tony"::5.0::September 15, 2011
RNYD3HL84BZX0::Great purchase::This computer has an excellent overall performance. I owned a HP Pavilion DV5 before this one with a Core 2 Duo and there is a big difference between them. The 15,6" display is great too and the aluminium case is well finished (although a little bit cold in winter and finger prints get easily marked on it). Memory size and HD are also significant pros in this laptop. I have only two minor issues: the battery charger is quite large, even bigger than the one my previous HP had, thus it's not very nice for travelling. The second issue is a simple but quite annoying thing: the num lock key has no "on" indicator (very strange considering the caps lock key does).Above that, the laptop provides an excellent user experience, with a much better boot up speed and delivering a noticeable processing power.I must point out that this laptop didn't came with Bluray player. There must be some mistake in the description.::Eduk79::5.0::June 7, 2011
R6913T2IP4KIY::Great Laptop for the Poweruser::I just got this laptop recently and I love it. Definitely a slick deal if you can ever get it for under 1000 dollars and the same specs. I'll make a list to keep it short and sweet.Pros:-Switchable Graphics are awesome. Just use Catalyst Control Center to switch between high powered gaming graphics and battery saving integrated graphics.-Super powerful! the i7 quad core is fast. Really fast. Especially for me, who upgraded from a single cored desktop.-Design is great. Everything looks really sleek. Aluminum finish is nice, but can get fingerprinty.-Keyboard is awesome. I can type really fast on it. Chicklet, comparable to Macbook's. The numpad/tenkey can be annoying for some, but I like being able to type:'-Fingerprint reader is actually pretty useful. I thought it was just a gimmick, but it works really well.-Amazing battery life if you can get the 9cell battery. I've gotten around 5-7 hours with light internet browsing. Maybe 3 hours with heavy [sc2] gaming.-Runs games well.-2 USB 3.0 slots.-A lot of other hp goodies, like coolsense and that one harddrive protection thing.Cons:-Keyboard is not backlit-touchpad's multitouch gestures (2 finger scroll and pinch to zoom) are kind of faulty-Screen resolution could be better, but for the gamers, remember that lower resolution will help games run better.Would definitely buy for any:GamerCollege StudentWindows enthusiastAnyone in need of a powerful windows computer.::Kevin::5.0::June 5, 2011
R1QSE541VH1VFY::Great features but broken graphics::I purchased this configuration (except with 1GB graphics) but this holds for both 1GB and 2GB cards:AMD/HP have enabled dynamic switchable graphics in this laptop.  This means you can on-the-fly choose which applications you would like to be high performance or low performance... but it doesn't guarantee which card the application will run on.  The driver does this, taking your suggestion into account.  Unfortunately, by design the driver never switches OpenGL graphics to the dedicated graphics card.  This means if you use any OpenGL applications regularly you will only use the integrated Intel graphics card, which is better than previous generations but by no means powerful.  Classic example: this is a laptop that can't run Minecraft, one of the most basic games.  It also won't accelerate any content applications like Photoshop, etc. that have optional OpenGL acceleration.If you don't use OpenGL ever, this is an amazing laptop.  Unfortunately it's advertised as fully supporting OpenGL, which in my mind makes this a product broken by design hence the score.EDIT: I'd like re-iterate out that this laptop isn't defective, by design OpenGL doesn't work.  HP is unable/unwilling to fix the problem and AMD has been completely silent about it.::Christopher J. Ashton::2.0::June 22, 2011

R2SGRHXPSK6D9H::So near, yet so far::I'm going to ship this back after two days of use. The main problem, other that its an underwhelming product in total, is design oriented. The laptop has an aluminum band around the edge. When you rest your palms on the plastic top while typing, the plastic sinks a little... just ennough for the sharp edge of the aluminum to dig into your wrists.A disastrous design error.::Allan Levene::2.0::June 2, 2011
R3FCKYIEG2K4AR::Could've been a great machine except for poorly placed touch pad::I've still got an old Dell Inspiron 8200 that I have been happy with for many years.  But, it's been feeling slow and it really can't keep up with some of the new software as well as having USB 1.0 ports that are painfully slow compared to USB 2.0.  So I wanted to get a new machine.  My main requirement was that the screen needed be be a high resolution one.  That limits choices.  I found a great deal on the HP.  So I took the plunge.The HP arrived on schedule and I started to use it right away.  Man this machine felt fast.  The screen was great.  The speed was great.  Sound was good.  No matter what they want you to believe, there is no way tiny laptop speakers will sound anything better than good.  They will not replace anyone's dedicated home stereo, unless it is really, really bad.  I was really happy with the computer at first.I was a happy camper until I started doing some typing.  I noticed that when I did a remote desktop connection to another computer the cursor would unexpectedly jump around.  This was annoying.  I thought that maybe I had a wireless router issue and tried reconnecting.  The problem kept recurring.  Then I noticed that the problem also occurred when I was using other software.  I then paid a closer attention and figured out the problem.  The touch pad on the computer is not centered with the keyboard.  It is offset to the right about 1/4".  I have no idea why they did that.  But that 1/4" offset means that when I type my right hand kept hitting the touch pad and making the cursor jump.  I don't have large hands, so I'm sure others would have the same problem.  I can't believe they would release a product with such a major problem.So less than three weeks after I got it and spent many hours setting it up and loading software I had to return the laptop.  When I called to get an RMA I was offered a discount, they didn't say how much, but I declined it without a second thought.Since then I have gone to a few stores to test out various laptops and I have no issues with other non-HP laptops.  Right now I am probably going to end up with a Dell, Sony or possibly an ASUS.It's really too bad as with the exception of the mis-placed touch pad I really liked the computer.::Alex "average joe"::2.0::June 30, 2011

R2LK3ODNOMEDT4::Slow but decent, especially at a massively discounted price::I bought this laptop on the auction website that starts with the letter "e."  Installing an antivirus program (Avast) killed the laptop, bringing the working speed to a crawl, until I uninstalled it. Microsoft Office 2000 installed and worked flawlessly.The D510 I bought came with only a CD-ROM drive, but then again, I paid less than $30 for it, and that included the cost of Priority Mail shipping. I seriously wouldn't pay more than $50. I bought it as a gift for a person who had no computer at all, and she is very happy with the laptop.The gift receiver has been diagnosed with an extremely rare and incurable illness, and she told me recently that she feels empowered having the ability to access information she needs online at the snap of her fingers. So even a laptop which seems to be outdated and useless to some people, is a gift of life to someone else.::Sam I Am::4.0::February 28, 2014

RFDQK7AP6008Q::A great piece of hardware, with some major flaws::I've had this computer for about 3 days, and my feelings on it went from wanting to defenestrate it, to pure love.  For starters, I ordered a separate 256GB corsair solid state drive so I can have fast boot and load times for the OS and apps.  Now, installing an additional hard drive in most laptops requires mostly just removing the bottom plate, but not for this laptop.  With this laptop, I had to remove the keyboard by prying it out and then carefully unlatching the connectors from the computer.  Then, I had to remove the the piece with the touch pad and unscrew a set of screws that are holding the bottom plate in.  Then, I'm finally able to remove the hard drive cover underneath the laptop after the last bit.  Why did Asus have to make such a trivial thing so complicated?Anyways, after I finally got to the hard drive bay I found out that the second empty bay has no bracket to hold a hard drive in.  I looked online and nobody was selling them.  Yes, that's right: this computer IS ADVERTISED as having the capability of storing an additional hard drive, but the company is not including or even selling any bracket to allow me to do it!  I couldn't find them anywhere!  So luckily, my drive was a solid state, with no moving parts.  What I ended up doing is taping some business cards underneath the solid state drive and letting it rest evenly on those, and then folding one of them between the space that the drive and the bay would occupy so that it doesn't wiggle around.  No issues so far, I'm pretty furious that I'm being put in this situation, and I'm definitely giving Asus a call and demanding that they ship or sell an extra bracket to me.  There is absolutely no reason at all why I have to do this.Lastly, once I got everything in place I decided to use the recovery cd's that I created in the beginning to reformate/unpartitian the primary drive and install windows 7 on the solid state drive... but guess what?  The recovery cd's do not have the capability of reformatting.  What I had to do was hunt down an .iso of windows and burn that to a disk, then use it as my windows install... because the recovery cd is not a 'true' windows.  I don't understand why Asus doesn't include a generic windows dvd since, you know, I PAID for the licence and it costs them next to nothing.  They did include a driver CD, which is generous.So that's all the bad stuff out of the way.  Once I got everything up and running and with the right setup, things got much better.  For starters, the performance on this thing is top-notch.  With a solid state drive as the main OS, this laptop boots up in 20 seconds.  It handles everything I throw at it with ease.  I have the laptop outputting to a second 24 inch monitor as an expanded desktop and it runs starcraft at full resolution and mostly high settings at around 40-60 fps.  Best of all, it doesn't 'downclock' to cool down like most of the laptops out there do.  The reason for this is an extremely efficient cooling system in the back that blows air out one vent and sucks in air at the other.  This keeps things relatively stable, and quiet.  I'm not waking up my GF while I game on starcraft after she goes to sleep, and in comparison the Envy 17 I had and returned before this (which cost a beefy 2300) sounded like a jet engine.This is a top-notch gaming rig, and I'm very happy with it so far.  Would I recommend to anyone else?  Well, it depends.  If you're going to be happy with the measly 500GB of storage, then yes.  However, if you want to do what I did or install a larger capacity hard drive, then I recommend you tread lightly or have a certified technician do it for you.::_Aurel_::4.0::May 23, 2011
R266HT43UJ8HVO::Greate laptop for small money::Excellent laptop, people who want to play games, but don't like to spend 1000$ + It was problems with magnetic proximity switch it (is remain magnetized, so when you push start button nothing happened). Basicly it think's that Lid is still closed and preventing laptop from starting (this is Asus safety measures). For people who are not advanced in PC hardware it can be a real chalenge. Cause they can think that laptop is not working and try to return it. Don't do it please... The laptop is ok, there are no any hardware problem.This is my solution (I am assembling PC's since 1996):  you just simply need to demagnetize the Sensore/switch:- Keep the system off, lid should be open and the battery in. It doesn't matter if the power cord is plugged in or not but its better if it is plugged in;-  Ok now take a paper and put it on the palm-rest to the lower right side from the touch pad. To give you an idea, this is a 2 inch x 2 inch spot under the small sticker that says "New Revision Certified Design" and lies between the touch pad and the large sticker that shows system specs and features. Furthermore this is the very spot where the magnet in the LCD lid (located to the right side of the camera) comes in contact/proximity when the lid is closed;- Now take a light magnet with medium intensity, shouldn't be too strong or big and rub it in circles on that 2 x 2 inch square spot where you have placed the paper(The paper is only optional but it is recommended as it would save the palm-rest from scratches if any). Do this for a minute or two.- Press the power button and voilà! You are done.Happy New Year and Kind Regards::Simonius::5.0::December 29, 2011
R3NU073TJG40UK::Best laptop I've ever owned::For me the laptop came and is working flawless.  No power button issues or any problems for that matter.  I can play Skyrim on high settings, and I'm blown away by the screen.  1080p on a 15inch looks very very nice.  I don't normally write reviews but I had to on this item since it seems to be getting bashed pretty badly.  I noticed the negative reviews before my purchase but took my chances based on the fact that all Asus motherboards I've bought were always top notch products.  Needless to say at $900 you really can't get a better or a more powerful laptop.  You have the assurance of buying from Amazon so if you got a faulty one, you can always return or exchange.  Asus also comes with a one year accidental warranty which I thought was a nice touch since my last laptop from hp was ruined when my wife's friend spilled wine all over the keyboard..For anyone who's on the fence about this laptop, I would say go for it.  Chances are there are many who's bought this laptop and has a had no problems like me.  The laptop is cool to the touch and the construction is very sturdy.  The back cooling system looks great and works even better.  I'm at lvl35 with my bow/thief in skyrim, and it's always so amazing to me that such a small little machine can run it so smoothly.::B.

R2WDZKLMARQUFK::FIX POWER BUTTON YOURSELF!! Great Computer::We all know this is an incredible buy for the price, except for the reviews.  I looked into this machine long and hard before I purchased it.  Many from many vendors haved arrived "doa" and also had issues with the power button.  Well believe it or not you can fix it yourself in about 5 seconds, all you have to do is swipe a magnet over the palmrest area (I go from right to left across the bottom) and wham your laptop WILL turn on.  I recieved this yesterday as many had, it would not power on, let it charge for a bit, and tried the button some more, still didnt work, then tried the magnet trick and it has been working great ever since.  There is a video on youtube of someone doing this as well if you need further assistance.  Further what is actually happening is a sensor that is supposed to sense the lid closing is too strong (it is magnetic) it can over time while sitting build up a "magnetic charge" and thinks the lid is closed when it is not, by using a magnet you are resetting the switch.  Should you have to do this? No, but at the price I dont find it to be an issue (mine has been working fine since the initial swipe of the magnet, ie the power button has been working, and if it stops in the future I know to keep a magnet handy).::Gibbs::5.0::December 23, 2011
RNB7VBOF34CRO::A Mixed, Mixed Bag::Times like this, I wish that the Amazon rating system was out of 10 rather than out of 5.  I feel this is more of a 3.5/5 than anything else, but that being said, I'd like to provide a bit of insight, having owned this computer for about a month-and-a-half now.The first thing anyone will probably notice about the notebook is its design.  It's a sleek, matte black, arguably minimalist and perhaps even understated.  Yes, I've had people compare it to a stealth fighter, but I personally enjoy the low profile, so to speak.  It's no where near as flashy as Dell's Alienware, but it's not supposed to be.  On the other hand, yes, it is large, about the size of a typical 17-inch laptop.  It's probably a tight squeeze with most 17" cases--as a note, I managed to squeeze it into Targus's 15" case, but I have yet to ascertain how.  Be aware that it is substantially thicker in the rear where the vents are located than in the front.Concerning hardware, the laptop is top-of-the-line, with a Sandy Bridge i7 Quad-Core processor, 6 GB of RAM (or 8 GB in some models), a 7200 RPM 500 GB hard drive, and a GTX 460M, plus a 1080p screen, all of which is denoted in the description.  A few notes on this: there are four RAM slots, two of which will be filled (with either 3 GB or 4 GB modules), so you can take advantage of the incredibly low RAM prices and add up to (presumably) 24 GB of RAM.  Be advised though, the BIOS is notoriously finicky, so your mile WILL vary.  On the plus side, the laptop can accommodate a second hard drive (mine came with a second hard drive mount pre-installed into the second hard drive bay; apparently some others have not).  Apart from that, the monitor is acceptable, though I had to toy with the settings a little to get the colors right.If benchmarks mean anything to you, you can comment and I'll respond to you personally; I don't feel like cluttering this review up with dozens of numbers.  Suffice to say, the processor is *almost* on par with the first-gen desktop i7 920, and it'll tackle most any calculation you throw at it, including sophisticated systems modeling with MATLAB.  The GPU is excellent, if an energy hog, and it is very good for gaming, even at 1080p resolution; you should be able to play on "high settings" with easy, and reasonable anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, etc.  It also accelerates all variety of media processing, whether conversion, decoding, and editing.  I've found it to be acceptable for rendering, but not optimal; however, it can be overclocked by around 20-25% with no stability issues, quite the feat.  RAM and hard drive, well, that's up to what you do, but I've found them both adequate.The chiclet keyboard takes some getting used to, and it may feel crammed if you have big hands/fingers, but the backlighting is nice.  I found the lack of dedicated volume controls problematic, but not a deal-breaker.  In other news, there's a single ethernet port, a VGA and HDMI output, three USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0, a mic and headphone jack, and a card reader.  Again, minimalist, but I haven't found myself desiring more.  The webcam is surprisingly high-quality, on par with Logitech's mid-range models.  The speakers are tinny and a bit of a disappointment.  Sure, laptops aren't renowned for their audio quality, but it feels as if Asus's engineers didn't even make an attempt.  You may also feel that the track-pad buttons are stiff, but it is not difficult to get used to.  On the plus side, I'm actually amazed at how cool this stays, even when running the CPU and GPU at near 100% load.Battery life is around three hours if the computer is kept to a minimal state (for typing or limited productivity work).  It is around two hours if a number of intensive applications are running at once, and around one hour if gaming.This alone, the laptop should easily qualify for four stars, perhaps even five.  There are two significant barriers in the way:1. The bloatware this laptop comes with could capsize an SSD, much less and HDD.  It slows the computer down substantially if not removed, a process which takes at least an hour, if not more. And the restoration disks they ask you to burn still include the bloatware, not to mention taking up a half-dozen DVDs.  I highly advise a fresh installation before doing anything else with the laptop, using the Windows install key found underneath the laptop.  With just removing the bloatware, the underlying system is inherently unstable afterwards--a month-and-a-half in, I've experienced significant slow-downs, and am now running off of a second hard drive I installed, with a clean Windows installation.  Which gets me to the next point:2. Accessing any hardware on this laptop actually requires a teardown.  Why, Asus?  Every other laptop I've owned has an easily accessible hard drive and RAM; just flip over the laptop, undo one or two screws, and voila, you can swap the hard drive or change the RAM.  For this one, you have to remove the keyboard and the panel with the trackpad, undo three ribbons and about a dozen screws, than finally prob open the back panel to get to the guts of the laptop.  It may sound simple, but it's a cautious, time-consuming process, and absolutely should not have been designed so absurdly.  Just to add a RAM stick, you would risk rendering your keyboard and trackpad inoperable, and possibly damage the motherboard.So that's about it.  I haven't experienced the power button or the power jack issues others have described, but despite its great value, the Asus G53SW is a purchase which demands caution.::Informer3X::3.0::January 7, 2012
R13KPSX1Z10B5Q::Excellent price/performance ratio...::Purchased 5/27, I've had adequate time to use the laptop.Be prepared for the usual gimmicks: Useless OS and bloatware.Out of the box, the laptop is blazing fast... for a while.Give it a couple hours, maybe run a DX11 benchmark or some 1080p video, it'll lock up (I know this to be true of the 17" and one other 15" model) and you'll fight the urge to break it in half with every muscle in your body.  Remember however, it's NEW and like all NEW electronics, the brilliant vendor has loaded the machine with their best of show gadgets, promotions, etc...Once you wipe the HDD of the factory screw-ups and load your own OS, you'll be pleasantly surprised.Currently dual booting Ubuntu 11.4 x64 and Windows 7 Ultimate x64.Boot time in either OS is always <15 seconds.Pros:-Very Clear Display (I've yet to see a screen this nice).-Reasonable battery life, 3-4 hours is common.-Runs very cool (seldom above room temp) and VERY VERY quiet (Also have a Dell XPS 17 w/ i7 and HP Envy 15 w/ i5 - both of which run VERY warm).-Keyboard is nice, REAL NICE.-Very rugged design.Cons:-HEAVY, but that is to be expected of any hardware this caliber-Giant power supply, again to be expected, but somehow DELL is manufacturing tiny power supplies for i7's, so it IS possible.-Attracts finger prints without even touching it.-ASUS Bloatware/ATK app is a bit laggy.The prospect of solid state HDD and additional RAM, keep me excited.::Linux6Root::4.0::June 20, 2011
R18KV0Y9JHYVDQ::Quality, Performance, Budget & Build - Awesome !::Lets start with the specs: Well as the description of the laptop given, amazon delivered the same product as advertised with prompt delivery and works perfectly.Some review states power button issues. To be honest I have not had any hardware problems so far. The other featured buttons may stop working when wondows 7 updates itself due to some driver conflict or something but that is no big deal, since all you have to do is downlaod the 'ATK drivers' from the website and the the buttons work perfectly again. (ASUS shouldnt be blamed for this to be honest, Windows should be !! )SCREEN: is not 3D but a really brilliant 1080p full HD screen.KEYBOARD: Backlit, comfortable and good quality. I find it softer than my previously owned HP. Tha back light has 3 illumintaion levels not a major feature but still comes in handy when working at night.CAMERA: Standard 2mp works a charm for its class.AUDIO: Much better than others I have heard. Good clarity and no jarring. Of course cant expect a surround sound or deep bass output its not made for your home theatre, if you are a audiophile invest in good external speakers (no brainer)!CD/DVD DRIVE: standard dvd drive for writing and reading which most laptops have. Unfortunately no blueray, but for me I never use BRdvds.GRAPHICS CARD: It has been handling everything from C.O.D to CRYSIS 2 amd most FPS games on high settings. Reviews say elsewise but it works perfectly for me. Still lot of games to play, so far so good. Not tried its 3D capability since if you really want 3D invest in a 3D system rather.There is a lot the 3D market has to develop still so dont bother much about it. AS far as I have heard the 3D capabilites are pretty decent. (Can't have everything for peanuts can you ! ;)PROCESSING: The i7-2630QM works a charm. I use a lot of photo softwares and does pretty well when the application is demanding. It is not as smooth as butter but performs well not to worry. It cut my editting time to half than my HP which was T9300 Core 2 duo 2.6GHZ with 4GB RAM and 256mb dedicated nvidia gfx card. In addition the ASUS has 8GB 1333Ghx RAM so thats a plus point. you can add upto 16GB.OS: Everything works fine as usual. The suprise is that it boots really quick than the Alienware or anyother laptops with similar configs!!! Tried and tested :)SOFTWARES: ASUS has put some extras in already which I think are annoying so I removed many of them which have no real functionality but its all upto you according to your way of working.ACCESSSORIES: NO bag or mouse included.Charger is more like an SMPS (LOL!) but it doesnt really matter to me since the charger is not my key feature I am investing in.If your wondering what can you fit this laptop in try 17" laptop bags coz they have enough room for this beast. I have just ordered a Lowepro Compuday (Slate) which can hold my DSLR and my laptop not yet seen if it fits since hasnt arrived yet but its worht a shot if you can preview it before you buy. Even alienwares ORION backpack accomodates without issues. I am sure there are many other out there just make sure its about 17" backpacks to save you the trouble.Overall this laptop has been reliable, very good build quality, really good price according to all the research I have been doing for months, this laptop has the best configuration for its afforadable price. Period.P.S: ALienware was my first option but seems they just over price you for the same configuration plus alienware looks much plasticy than this one. So if you want an alienware and no money for the fancy thing this laptop gives u the same for half the price and to my opinion better in quality and design.::Amazon Customer::5.0::August 18, 2011
R2OP59J0B5GHTK::Had trouble in the beginning, but i'm loving it now!::At first, the asus live update kinda threw me off, because it kept getting rid of my ATK driver. ATK driver is for hotkeys such as fn button i believe. I had to re-install ATK driver from the asus support site and now it works fine. After that i just got rid of the asus live update, since most people told me it causes many problems. I'm not a intense gamer, however, this baby does run all the games i throw at him at max settings. The computer itself does not overheat, and it is not even loud at all. Keyboard is really nice to type on and it doesn't flex much. Overall, i am really shocked how well built this thing is.::Fred::5.0::May 28, 2011
R28NY0EFDP0P1O::Power Button Issues? There's a fix.::I received the Asus G53SW-XA1 as a gift for christmas/birthday. This gaming laptop is a beast and runs all of my games perfectly, I would highly recommend buying it if you're an avid gamer!There is a slight drawback though - there are two minor flaws that can be easily fixed/avoided.1) Power Button won't work: Rub a medium strength magnet on the bottom right area of the touchpad.2) Power Pin is fragile: Buy an "L" connector for the power supply pin.An interesting fact: the video card of this older series (G53SW/G73SW) is actually faster/stronger than the newer series (G53SX/G74SX).G53SX/G74SX Video Card: GTX 560M, 128bit busG53SW/G73SW Video Card: GTX 460M, 192bit bus::E.

RMBK79HTA05RV::Value through the roof.::I'm a college student who likes to game. So basically I have a limited budget, require a computer I can take from my house to class, and it needs to be powerful so I can game. After doing my research, I arrived at this computer. On paper...just wow. The processor, RAM, video card and display combo that this laptop features is simply fantastic, and I couldn't find it with any other computer for anything less then about $1300. At the time, this laptop was going for $900. Then I saw all the problems this laptop has had. Took a chance, figured I could return it if it was dead on arrival. After using this computer for two weeks I'd say this is by far the most pleased with a computer purchase I have ever been. This computer is lightning quick, and I can play games like Shogun 2 and Civ 5. On a $900 laptop. I challenge anyone to find a computer with more under the hood for the same price.On feature notes, having a wireless N-band card is great, I'm no longer as tethered to my router as I used to be. The backlit keyboard is great, as well as having a numpad. The trackpad is also good, though the click is maybe a little too firm for my tastes. Whatever, use an external anyway. Battery life has been about 1-2 hours, which is fine with me. The internal camera is also pretty sweet, good resolution. I was looking for a computer I can pick up and move to somewhere else, not a laptop I can use while traveling, so weight/size is fine with me.Too long, didn't read summary:Buy this computer. You won't find better value anywhere else.::Jon W::5.0::January 15, 2012
R8E0F3XBX2FME::asus fails its promise::After readingg mediocre reviews I still decided to purchase this laptop.  At the 899 price who wouldn't?  I was hoping that asus would have fixed the power issue by now, but I was completely wrong.  From theminute I arrived the laptop wouldn't power on.  I let the laptop charge overnight,and yes, the green indicator light on the charging cable was lit and so was the orange light below the touchpad.  IT JUST WON'T TURN ON!  I called asus support this morning and filed for a RMA since I'm NOT dealing with a faulty product costing $899.  The troubling part for me was that the service Rep, after having me attempt a hard start, sad he has never heard of the issue with the lid/magnet.  At this point I became extremely upset and told him that I needed to speak to a manager. LONG STORY MADE SHORT, I was told the would conduct a review of the reviews left on this and other sites. I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY COULD TELL BY THE # OF RMA'S  After getting off the phone with my rma I did attempt the magnet trick and it did work, but the minute I closed the lid the problem happened again on the next start-up attempt.  I did not spend money to carry around a mangnet.I am writing a letter to asus corporate offices (Asus Computer International,  800 Corporate Way, Fremont,CA 94539) I suggest everyone else do the same.::nb medic student::1.0::December 29, 2011
RPK7EXGZBL4YA::I wanted to love it.::I've had this laptop for about a year and a half now...  on and off.  I bought it when it just came out (read $1500 with tax) and it worked like a dream for the first three months.Then the screen started to go.  It would bleed colors like no tomorrow and eventually the screen ceased to work at all.  I tried sending an inquiry to tech support online.  Nothing.  After calling tech support they gave me a RMA and I shipped it back.  The servicing was done in a few days and shipped back.  All in all about two weeks of no laptop.  Online tech support emailed me when the laptop was on its way back to me to ask if my screen was still giving problems and if it was they would give me a RMA number and I could send it in for repairs.  There is obviously a disconnect between the two tech support branches.About 9 months later the metal pin in the female power receptacle broke off in the power cord.  No idea how that happened.  Once again the phone tech support was the only way to go.  I sent the laptop in to service once again. Between the diagnostics and waiting for a part the repair and shipping another month of no laptop.When I got my laptop back it had been lobotomized.  My $1500 powerhouse was crashing, freezing and randomly turning itself off when under load.  Oh and don't forget the blue screen message  " Driver Power State Failure" popping up for flavor every once and a while.  I'm back on the line once again with tech support.  I updated every  driver I could, I reset the  bios settings to factory, I finally reloaded windows to very little avail.I don't live in the US so every time I have to send my laptop back for repairs I have to wait till I, or someone I know, is traveling up there to mail it off.  Which could be months at times.  I chose Asus for their innovative design supposed reliability.  I chose a gaming rig because I travel for a living.  I chose wrong.The laptop was sent back to Asus AGAIN for repairs on the 16th of August.  It is now the 17th of Sept and not only is it not repaired but the RMA inquiry online states that it's awaiting technical support from Asus.  WTF?  Calling does no good as the phone technicians seem to consult the same website as I do for their information.At this point I don't even want it back.  I'd accept a partial refund or a replacement for a more reliable model.  Asus has had my laptop for almost 15% of the time I've owned it and that's not even counting the time I've waited for a chance to ship it back.::MileHighGuy::2.0::September 17, 2012
R2ZBA6UJ0WHFUJ::Verdict is still out::I was really excited to get this laptop, I am in the Technology field and work with it all day every day. It is heavy but I knew that going into it. It is a processing beast. Great Screen , many power options. The one thing that has been bugging me is the sensor in the lid that lets the laptop know the ids closed I should go to sleep. Going to sleep isn't a problem, Opening the lid and hitting the power button is. the laptop will not return from sleep mode when you hit the power button. I did some research and found that the magnetic sensor in the chasis is to blame. It is a strong magnet that keeps its charge even after you have opened the lid it thinks its still closed. I have to use a fridge magnet slid across the mouse pad to reduce the magnetic charge so when I hit the power button it will bring the laptop out of sleep mode. Other than this very annoying caveat I like this laptop. I keep thinking that eventually the magnet will get broken in but I'm not sure that will ever happen.::Chad::3.0::January 16, 2012
R1Z3SW4IIFF290::Despite rocky start-up, fantastic product.::I got this earlier today in unscathed packaging. Un-boxed it, inserted the battery, plugged it in and pressed the power button.....did not turn on. I was ready with a refrigerator magnet in hand; I swiped it back and forth along the lower edge of the laptop, right under the trackpad. Pressed the power button again and I was on my way.Construction: Very hefty-I would hate to drop this on my foot--and very solid..I liken the build to a tank. The keyboard is pretty nice--the keys are cushy, but not so sensitive that accidental presses happen. The trackpad is lacking a bit, due to a noticeable friction and the buttons require a bit too much force for my taste--but really, who uses a trackpad for gaming? I plugged in a mouse immediately. The three buttons on the top left are a nice touch (left toggles the backlit keyboard's brightness levels, middle adjusts laptop performance, for those who do not want to use OCing software and the right switches screen presets) and still keep with the aesthetic of simplicity. The arrow buttons are about two-thirds the size of normal keys--it may be a gripe for some, but not a huge deal to me. On the sides of the laptop are plenty of connections which I'm not going into detail here--check out Amazon's spec page for that. The AC cable is an issue, though. It is RIGHT where a right-handed mouse would be--big oversight on Asus's part. Also, the AC connector is not L-shaped--do NOT bump that or you'll muff up the inside connection. I thought I'd mention how HUGE the AC brick is--roughly around the size of two PSPs stacked on top of each other.Software: Okay, seriously, this thing comes pre-loaded with A LOT of bloatware--my favorite was the Blu-ray software for a laptop without it. Clean out that junk and you'll notice a nice speed increase. Let me say that it doesn't approach Alienware's level of bloat, but for Asus, it's a bit out of the ordinary. I don't see a reason to dock a star because of this--it's something to expect and is unrelated to the product.Hardware: To start this out, this is NOT a top of the line gaming laptop--for a lot of you, this is a deal-breaker. But, with that out of the way, I am very satisfied with the performance. The combination of 8 gigs RAM, I7 and 7200RPM hard drive keeps things snappy. If you're looking for something faster, throw in an SSD. The 460M is great--doesn't max out BF3, but it'll still deliver smooth gameplay with graphics that top current consoles. If you want an EXTRA boost, install ThrottleStop (google it), click on options, tick the "Unlock Bi-Directional PROCHOT" checkbox, click ok, then click "Turn on." You'll notice a nice frame-rate boost and also less dips in the frame-rate. It'll raise the GPU's temperature slightly, but the fans on this laptop are quite the showstoppers. Always around room temperature under any load--very quiet, too. I have nothing to say about the DVD drive--it's basic and does what it's supposed to.Battery: About 2 hours for me with everything on high performance. Short, but nice, for a quick session without the AC cable in the way.Overall: Fantastic product by Asus--the fourth one I've used--their quality just keeps getting better. I'll stick with them for a while.P.S. Shortly after I bought this, the price increased by $400. I'm recommending this product at its sale price ($900) not at its current price. Get the G74SX for just a little more.::Ryan F.::5.0::January 5, 2012
R2KROJ4VF83LSQ::Amazing Machine!::After dealing with a series of defective Alienware M14x laptops I decided to give Asus a try. Their motherboards are pretty much the best you can buy and I have never had a single problem with any Asus motherboard I've owned. The G53SW comes with the GTX 460 which is actually more powerful than the GTX 560 in the G53SX. This particular model came with 6GB of 1333 Mhz DD3 memory, a 7200 RPM Seagate hard drive, the GTX 460 GPU, I7-2630 CPU, and the full HD screen. What really sold me on this was the option to install dual hard drives. I would have been happier if it came with a hardware RAID controller but it can be done with software as well. The main benefit to having dual hard drives is performance: you can install a SSD or set it up in Raid 0 and get a pretty decent performance boost. Another huge selling point for me is the 4 RAM slots which gives the option to upgrade to 16GB of total memory. The memory installed is only 1333Mhz instead of the 1600 but that's not a huge deal as memory is very cheap.PROS:When I got it (quickly I might add) the first thing I noticed was how nice the screen looked. It has a good contrast ratio, good viewing angle, and is the perfect size. I can run all of the newer games at high to ultra at 1080 with a minimum of 35 - 40 FPS including Battlefield 3, Dues ex, Star Trek Online, Bioshock 2, Everquest 2, and Starcraft 2. It has plenty of USB ports including a USB 3.0 which I'm sure will be neat when there are more USB 3.0 devices. The keyboard is back lit which is neat even though the only color option is white (there are mods for other colors). The accidental warranty coverage is nice for peace of mind but keep in mind it only covers one incident of accidental damage.CONS:The keyboard is one of my least favorite things about this computer. It is not very responsive and is annoying to type on because it misses keystrokes quite often. I am also not happy with the position of the power cord. It is towards the center on the right hand side which is right where I keep my mouse. I frequently bump into the cord when playing games which is annoying. If it was further back it would be much more convenient. The speakers are not very loud and are mediocre at best.Other notes:I haven't used the touchpad much at all so I have no opinion. The computer is also quite heavy (close to 8lbs) but is still very portable.Overall:Excellent computer, definitely worth the price. I purchased an upgraded wireless card (to connect to 802.11a) and the 3 year square trade warranty with accidental damage and still paid less than I did for the Alienware.::HabaneroHotShot::5.0::December 30, 2011
RPDUDUJI7MTGQ::Just what I thought it would be.::So, I saw some negative reviews because of hardware defects.  Took a chance.HARDWARE IS PERFECT.  Two weeks in and no problems.Runs everything.  I can run Battlefield 3 on near Ultra (gotta turn down a couple settings like AA) at 1080.  Skyrim runs perfect.Pros:Runs everything great.Great bang for your buck.RAM upgradeableNICE screen.Cons:I don't like the placement of the cooling outlets.  They are right where my legs are and can get hot if you place your laptop directly on your legs.::J Williamson::5.0::November 15, 2011
RJ2ZQGFJAX2T::Amazing piece of PC. With an annoying USB 3.0 bug.::One thing to mention: the 1080P on a 15-inch screen is UNPRECEDENTED. I simply cannot use any other laptop now after using this screen.Everything else is just fine, CPU and graphics and all being top-notch, system still freezes when under heavy duty. The problem is the HDD, other parts are much faster than the hard drive.It's got a very annoying USB 3.0 bug,,, if you plug in a device and leave the PC somehow to shut down or sleep, you won't be able to get anything connected at the 3.0 for a certain time... even if you restart. but mystically it recovers from the problem over time...In a word, worth buying, best choice for your only PC - if you don't have a desktop. There's no need to get a super portable notebook... you'll have a tablet!::Hans::5.0::September 8, 2011
R2F1ZUTPF9WPY2::DC Power Connector weak::While this laptop has exceptional performance, when it works, there is a fatal flaw in this entire series.ASUS uses a sub-par power connector... the central pin in the DC power jack has broken twice in the last 6 months on my machine. They repaired it the first time (a process that required sending the machine to Milpitas, CA twice, because on the first repair they forgot to reattach the antenna for the wireless), at a time without my laptop of about 1 month. Now, after three months, it has happened again (and I have been very careful with it this time).It is inconceivable to me that they would scrimp on a $2 part for a $1300 performance laptop, but they have. You would have thought that the industry would have learned from Apple!The other issue I have had (which is minor in comparison) is that it is larger than most 17" laptops, making it difficult to find a bag that fits it.So, my suggestion is to not buy this laptop... instead by an Alienware or a Dell (yes, I know alienware is owned by Dell).::Jack Brown "silbeg"::1.0::July 5, 2011
R2UZ2EJ1KB7FCN::Two defects in a row::I ordered this laptop for my grandson to play games and do virtual school work.  Amazon.com was fantastic!  VERY courteous, easy to work with, and very prompt delivery.  The laptop was packaged very well even though loosely placed in a 2nd box.  No visable damage to the packaging or the product.Upon powering up the laptop it became obvious that there was internal screen damage.  About half of the screen was pixelated with color strips running top to bottom.  Four restarts and exactly the same issue.  I also noticed that the laptop had a plasma screen.  I immediately notified Amazon.  Customer support was superb.  I work in the contact center environment and I must say that Amazon has the BEST and most CUSTOMER ORIENTED support team I have ever worked with.  A return was processed and a replacement unit recieved the very next day.The replacement unit was also defective, however it appeared to have an LED screen.  Exact same model as the first, which I confirmed on the label.  This one would not power up at all.  I notified Amazon and they asked very nicely if I would talk to ASUS support.  I did.  ASUS determined the laptop to be defective and recommended its return.At this point I processed a 2nd return with the exceptional Amazon customer service team.  This time I selected a different model but still elected to stay with the ASUS brand.  I feel ASUS to be a very good manufacturer but am dissapointed at this particular model.  It has caused me to question their Quality Assurance methods.At this point I am waiting for the next replacement.PROS:  Amazon.com's excellent customer service.  They truly impressed me.CONS:  Two defects in a row on this ASUS model.  I would definitely not buy this model again.::Cookieman::1.0::October 15, 2011

R3P83F14EQ416C::Bunk laptop from my experience.::So I picked up this bad boy in September hoping to get deep into PC gaming with a laptop powerhouse that could run almost any game I wanted on medium-high settings. Here's what happened:Out of the box, the first laptop was a dud. It would turn on, but the screen was just dead. Keyboard lit up, it made noise, but no screen. No luck with HDMI cable to a TV either. I sent it into ASUS for repairs (should have sent it back to Amazon for an exchange!) but I had my working laptop back in my possession a week or so later. 2 months pass, this beauty is ran Skyrim on high settings flawlessly. All of the sudden, the same problem starts happening again. So I contact ASUS who says I can send it in for repairs again (is that some sort of joke? You didn't fix it, guys) or contact the retailer. So I contact Amazon.After a few attempts, my case gets sent to a supervisor and he express ships me a new laptop. ~Two days later it comes in the mail. This one is just dead. Won't boot, nothing. I tried using my other battery, only AC plugged in, nothing at all.I think ASUS just messed up a bit on this model. DO NOT BUY IT. Many other people have had my same experience, this model is a DUD.::vic::2.0::January 13, 2012

R13LTRKEV7FGAZ::Great notebook, but have several design flaws and crappy support::I bough this notebook, it is really great for gaming, runs most of modern games on maximum. It is quite heavy specially with the charger that is of the size of a construction brick, but I was expecting that.What I was not expecting is the VGA cooling fan start making this really loud rattling noise. It is so annoying... I called ASUS support about the warranty and explained them that I work with this notebooks, I run simulations and a single day without it would cost more than repairing it by myself. They said the couldn't help me in absolutely any way besides me sending the notebook to them, which could take weeks to get back. I would be happy even if they just told me what fan is that so I could buy one and replace it by myself, but not even that the support could do.So.. don't count on the support nor the durability of parts. Still a great notebook considering its price.Update aug 2012:Now the keyboard and the headset plug are failing, this notebook is a huge waste of money. ASUS support is basically nonexistent.Update sep 2012:Now the DVD reader stopped working, makes a weird noise and shows no dvd. Crappiest notebook I ever bough...::Tiago::1.0::June 14, 2012

R30F2TONMQ81E2::Substandard parts, Substandard Support, Non-existant Warranty Repairs!!::I have had this laptop since October 2011 and the power plug just broke off in my adapter this morning.  This is the only problem I have had with this laptop since I purchased it, but come on, this is a major part of a notebook/laptop that gets used daily!  It should be made from quality material so that it won't break under normal use!!!!I will update this after I see how ASUS support handles the repair.  I have an RMA and the laptop gets shipped to CA today for repair.4-23-2012The laptop has been at the ASUS CA repair depot for over three weeks now and they say they are waiting on parts to complete the repair!  A repair depot that doesn't stock repair parts...you have got to be kidding me!This power connector issue seems to be more of a problem than I noticed in the reviews when I purchased the laptop.  This is a very frequently used part that is of inferior quality and ASUS doesn't even stock the part that they know is inferior....OMG!Update after I receive the laptop back....hopefully soon...yeah right...5-7-2012 UpdateMy notebook is still at the depot awaiting parts.  They have "escalated" the RMA twice and I still haven't received any phone call that I was promised would happen.  This has turned into a joke.  The ASUS support website has become totally unusable.  They are obviously making changes, but the changes are preventing accessing any pertinent information on the status of the RMA at all!  I have spoken with numerous "help desk" personnel that obviously have no clue as to what is happening with my notebook.  They are reading a screen and that is all they are good for....not much at all!I am actually speaking with a "Romaine" today that says that there are numerous people with the same issue and due to this, the parts are high in demand and hard to keep in stock.  Oh boy, doesn't that sound like an excuse for substandard parts?  It sure does to me!If I could rate this below a "1" I would!!!!::James Spencer::1.0::April 3, 2012
R2PBQ4OBW0NZWI::Don't buy refurbished::just bought this from warehouse deals refurbished for 869 dollars and got it yesterday, and after 5 hours of playing around with it, this is the worst expierence i've ever had with a laptop and i will never buy anything refurbished or from asus again. when i turned it on and did the initial setup the screen froze at least four times and i had to keep rebooting it. when i finally got past the setup and started playing around on the laptop, it was veeery slow. for something with an i-7 anyways. my dv6 booted and ran faster than this. internet explorer kept crashing constantly, and there is something wrong with the network adapter on my computer, as it will disconnect me from the internet every few minutes, and this never happens on my other laptop or my desktop. worst of all though, the computer will shut off at random times. mabye this is a problem with the battery or something but its super annoying. in fact it shut off while i was typing this review so i had to reboot and retype what i had so far. for the price i paid, it would have been an awesome computer for the price with the specs, but i guess the saying you get what you pay for applies here, as the refurbished model was 200 dollars cheaper at the time i bought it. very dissapointed with amazon, this computer shouldn't have passed inspection and been classified as refurbished since its very defective. i'm getting a refund and taking my buisness elsewhere.::mike::1.0::January 7, 2012

And I have to return it for refund. Never never buy this computer. You will regret that.::hawkon::1.0::November 26, 2011
R3UXO0JI7BND9U::Asus should be ashamed::It seems I'm not the only one have power issues with this one.I've actually gone through 2 of these laptops. I ordered the first laptop from New Egg, but it came broken out of the box. The thing would just not turn on. After I returned it to New Egg (New Egg could not offer a replacement since they were out of stock), against my better judgement I ordered the same model on Amazon - except Amazon's model has 2 more gigs of ram.The model that came worked for a few days. But you'd have to press the power button a few times before you got anything. The laptop is big so it's not really meant to be carried. SO when I actually did take it somewhere, it slipped out of my bag pack. One small bump, and it's now out of commission permanently. The issue seems to be power, because I actually was able to revive it at some point, but have not been able to since.Now, I get the pleasure of wrestling with ASUS's Accidental Damage Protection - 2 weeks, and several phone calls later, and I finally have an address to send the thing. The website that shows "status" of a repair was perpetually stuck at "Awaiting Confirmation" for a week, before it then moved to "Complete." Why have several stages of repair status, if you only use two, the first and last?  This resulted in numerous phone calls with ASUS representatives who could not tell me WHY it was halted at the "Awaiting Confirmation" stage, and who would assure me I would be getting a phone call from them in one or two days. No phone calls ever came, prompting me to call in again - and only to get the same reply. Either no one there knows what's going on or they just don't care.The Accidental Damage Protection works once over the course of the year. One month in, and I've used it up. Basically means I'm SOLed when it breaks the 2nd time. Save your money folks.::Quon::1.0::June 27, 2011
R3EF2NY4XY1KLJ::Will not power on!::This is a wonderful and great value for a laptop... when it actually works! The first one sent to me did not power on at all and was sent back. Amazon was awesome and shipped me another the next day. The new one also had the exact same issue where it would not power on. After some research I managed to get it to power on with the "magnet trick". This basically involves passing a magnet over the touchpad in order to get it to think the lid is NOT closed (the magnet sensor in the touchpad is prone to not working properly). This worked a few times but now it does not power on at all again.Don't cheap out with this laptop, get something better.::Alex::1.0::January 5, 2012
RMYN17NKMTFH5::Do not purchase ASUS products::Update - Took ASUS to Small Claims Court here in California and won.  Got the refund check on December 30, 2011.  State & Federal lemon laws apply to computers but you must follow process & procedure with ASUS and the court system in order to prove your case.IMPORTANT.  Document every interaction with ASUS.  Of course, I'm only stating what I would do.Do not buy from ASUS.  Terrible customer service and warranty support.  Purchased G53SW laptop in March 2011.  Headed to small claims court.  NOTE: Federal and CA state lemon laws cover computers.  Problems begin in late April with ingame lag then progressed to system freeze, keyboard/mouse not responding, forced to perform hard reboot.  1st call to tech support performed recovery, no resolution. 2nd call dropped it off at official repair center, Bizcom, replaced fan.  3rd call Biscom replaced hard drive, graphics & WiFi card.  4th call still waiting on results (at Bizcom again).  Customer service experience mirrors what others have reported: 1. As of today, 25-Jul ASUS reports the unit wasn't received at Bizcom.  I personally dropped it off on 19-Jul.  2. Calls to customer support line have a 25% chance of disconnecting when placed on hold either in queue or agent activated.  3. Three times told supervisor would call within 24 hours.  Still waiting.::Jabbertalkie "thx1138"::1.0::July 25, 2011

R37259W2QILM41::Dell 1012 Inspiron Mini 10::I was very happy with the service from the seller, this is only a review on the laptop.My husband and I are in the process of upgrading our home computer: I purchased the mini for my own private use, mostly for Microsoft Word and web surfing (limited - mostly Facebook, email, etc.), so I could go back to using my Nook HD+ as an e-reader and not as a tablet. It really is a nice netbook for this purpose. I think the  main drawback is the netbook I purchased has Windows 7 Starter.  I am going to have an upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium (and the ram also) - which I will have taken care of by a local computer store since it is an OEM OS installed and I want to play it safe.  As of right now, the only flaws I found with the Dell Inspiron Mini: Windows 7 Starter (waste of an OS); little slow with the 1G; and the screen resolution is low, not as vivid as I would like. I will update this review after the upgrades are completed next week. Windows 7 Starter is very disappointing.::Amazon Customer::4.0::December 27, 2013
RW0D2KF0KJV1V::Very Solid Laptop::Now i was really skeptical about buying this laptop because it looked a little too good to be true, but wow am i glad i did. If your looking for a gaming or hightech laptop, this is not for you. This laptop would best suit a business proffesional. I've only had it for 2 weeks but its already exceeded my expectations. Im very happy with my purchase. The only con that i could truly say bothers me is that the battery only lasts about 40 minutes off the charger so im gonna have to go and purchase a new battery, but for the price of a 2.4 ghz duo core, 160hd, 4gbs of ram, theres not much complaining here.::adam a::5.0::December 30, 2011

Seller was apologetic and has offered to provide full refund and pay for return shipping. I ended up keeping the computer.

Budden "Sci Fi Guy"::5.0::January 27, 2012
R10R2Y40X8DM9D::Could it be any worse?::I work at a computer shop and got one of these to chuck due to the damaged power jack.  After destroying the drive and beginning to tear the machine down for recyling, I figured I'd attempt a repair and perhaps see what it's capable of.  So I repaired the jack, threw in 4GB RAM, and reloaded Windows on a new hard drive.  At first, it seemed pretty decent.  I didn't have very high expectations but having a Atom N270 based netbook I use frequently, I had some expectations for the single core processor.  Oh was I wrong...Generally speaking, it wasn't too bad.  I'm sure the 4GB of RAM, no paging file, and a clean install of Windows really helped out.  However, this system gets bogged down entirely too easily.  The latest drivers all around, latest flash, etc...  flash video playback was practically nonexistent.  Local HD video playback was equally poor.  And even simple multitasking would cause the system to shutter and freeze momentarily until it had time to catch up.Now, I know this isn't meant to be a powerhouse.  It's basically a netbook in a 15.6" case.  However, let me bring my previous netbook back.  I have a Dell Mini 9 running Windows 7, 2GB RAM, and a generic 16GB SSD.  While this lil system will get bogged down frequently, it seems to play back most flash-based videos tremendously more smoothly than the much newer E-240/HD 6310.  This completely baffles me and honestly sickens me that even the latest low-end processors from AMD are essentially the same performance as Intels Atom's from a couple generations back.OK, well I got a bit off topic there regarding the CPU.  A bit more with regards to the laptop itself.  All in all, the case and materials aren't too bad.  Plastics do have a cheaper feel to them, but I find many current Toshiba's share the same plastics...  Over-all build quality isn't bad though.  Everything seems to fit together nicely.  Being such a simple laptop, there's not a whole lot to creek or be wrong.Audio and video are fine.  The screen is your standard 15.6" as most any laptop shares now of days (it's already been removed and placed in a Dell N5030 :P)  Speakers are fine too.  Not your high-end harman kardon you find on some previous models, but decent sounding for what they are.  However, there is NO WEBCAM...  Here I thought all laptops had webcams today!  HAH!Battery life is quite good.  Being a netbook underneath, expect similar battery life.  I've gotten 4 hours quite easily out of this laptop under basic usage (casual surfing, occasional video, lots of chatting online).  Also remember this laptop was used before I got my hands on it!And finally, heat.  I find this quite disappointing.  The fan runs constantly.  While the laptop itself doesn't heat up too much (to the touch) the CPU runs way too hot in my books.  Everything I see points it runs at about 55*C to 75*C depending on what's being done.  Max temp for the chip is 90*C.  I confirmed the fan was fine, no obstructions/dust, even repasted the heatsink (which helped a little)...  But still, much hotter than I should be running and I suspect it'll be the death of these.So in short, stay away from this laptop.  Spend a little more and at least get the duel core model.  Or heck, as much as I discourage used computers, a nice used laptop would be substantially better for the price!::D. Adams::2.0::August 5, 2012
R35YV9Y8HMARYB::died within a month, bad hard drive::In all fairness this was not bought on amazon but the exact laptop was bought at walmart.com. We even got the 2yr drop break spill warranty from them. The laptop was wonderful for the first few weeks. When we tried to use the webcam we noticed it was very dark. In about another week the laptop began to get very slow, next it would jamb up and you would have to restart it. Finally in another week the blue screen of death appeared with error message. We were told we had to contact TOSHIBA as it was still under warranty. (Just over a month had we had it by now) Toshiba tried to do some stuff over the phone and then the tech said that it was a bad hard drive, that it happened alot if there was a bvad batch and it would have to be replaced. He said he would e-mail me the info. Well it turns out that it is going to cost us 25.00 to mail this computer back to them. You know I would not complain if the laptop was out of warrenty or older but we hadn't had it for just over a month. No idea if it will work when it comes back or for how long.::E.

R3PCZMB1URXXI2::Worked great for a few weeks then it died::I ordered this laptop to replace an older Dell Inspiron I had that worked very well and I had a good experience with.  As stated in the title at first it was great; fast, it ran Star Trek Online and Fallout: New Vegas on medium settings with no problems. After completing some Windows updates it wouldn't wake up from hibernation. I reset the computer and it never rebooted, it would stop at the Windows loading screen every time.I sent it to Dell to see if they could fix it, they did......sort of. After taking out of the box fresh back from the Dell repair shop, it booted very fast like the first time and then thirty minutes later the touch pad died. Just died. Luckily, I had wireless mouse on hand and after looking around on the system for awhile I found that the computer no longer recognized that the touch pad existed at all. I went to the Dell support home page and found the drivers for the touch pad, they wouldn't take. I installed them and nothing the touch pad is still dead.Dell wanted me to send it back to them so they could fix it again, no thanks I said. Amazon however agreed to give me a full refund after talking to them for about 20 minutes. Great customer support. So now I'm waiting for the refund and will be buying a new laptop from a different company.::Zachary Palmer::1.0::October 27, 2011
RILQXTANJKM2R::solid machine spoiled by functional problems::When I first unpacked this and set it up I was very excited - the machine itself is solid and functional, screen is great, keyboard quite good for a laptop.  However, two sets of issues have presented sufficient frustration that I don't think I will ever again buy a Dell product.The first to appear is the huge amount of preloaded software, some of which is very difficult to get rid of.  Central in annoyance is the row of huge tiles across the center of the screen for quick access to all the stuff I will never ever use, totally blocks the screen until you find the little "x" to get rid of it until next time. I probably spent 3 hours figuring out how to make it go away permanently.I don't know if it's Dell or the new version of windows, but it is all but impossible to get rid of those silly useless little logo tiles - and again it took several hours even to figure out how to control them.  Documentation is seriously crappy, and there is no support.I use a wireless transmitter so I can listen to Pandora, as well as to the music I have stored on my hard drive and play them on my stereo in the other room.  Almost every time I want to use the transmitter for Pandora, I have to configure the machine to send the signal out through the wireless instead of to the built in speakers (which are tinny, good for nothing beyond talking on Skype).  Again - documentation is crappy; the little pictures on the devices menu say it is hooked up and running, and it takes an hour or longer to figure out how to get it to work.  Often I have to play something through RealPlayer (which for some reason does go to the transmitter) - then I turn off RealPlayer and, like magic, Pandora comes out of the living room speakers.  But next time I turn it on, it's through the tinny little built-ins again and I have to go through the whole routine all over again.I bought a wireless printer with the package.  Same problem - the cute little pictures say it is "ready" but when I print the job goes to a file, not to the printer.  Every time I want to print something, it takes an hour or longer to figure out how to get the printer to work - I often have to go through the entire setup again.I've had this machine for over a month, have wasted probably 20 hours trying to iron out the bugs, and it still isn't working right, and Dell offers absolutely no support.The menu of little pictures they have in place of the former detailed system menu is worthless.  Very few options, almost none of what you need in order to get rid of the cutesy crap and clutter or make the peripherals work.Great engineering, terrible software and interfaces, almost no documentation, help menu worthless, and far too much pre-loaded junk. This is the 4th Dell machine I've bought - and the last.::Tyge::2.0::October 26, 2011
R1AI8TQSW9GJJI::DO NOT BUY THIS HEADACHE!!::If Amazon would permit a post with ZERO stars, that is the rating I would give.This machine has now eaten up four (4) months of my office time and $$ in computer restoration. Dell has had me return it 3 times in the past 4 months, commencing in month 6 of my ownership (brand new from Costco). It does not work, at all, the hard drive and motherboard have been replaced; the techs verbally assured us memory had been replaced although this doesn't show in Dell's internal records. It doeds not finish booting up, it turns itself off (except the power button remains lit up in white, and the internal "guts" keep whirring, so it cannot be turned off except by removing the electric plug as well as the battery.The Dell floor supervisor in Tech support just informed me that since I've "Owned" it almost a year now they cannot replace it. WTF? I've "owned" it 6 months, and it's been in Dell's hands during the last 4 months while Dell keeps NOT repairing it. I've owned laptops, and this baby is nothing but a very expensive paperweight. DO NOT PURCHASE IT!! You have been warned. I will NEVER again purchase any DELL product; in each call for support we are tossed around through at least 3 departments. Just today, whilst typing this, I am now on the phone 56 minutes, awaiting department #3. Now a second "floor supervisor" who "just wants to help me" is sending me "up two levels" to another department via "escalation", saying that "Corporate Team" may be able to replace my machine.Wait time, and this is the shortest Dell call to date these past 4 months, is now officially over an hour.Think Dell looked at my location and realized that shipping me another substandard "refurbished" machine would be cheaper than sending a tech to fix a laptop which obviously is not capable of being repaired.......at least not at the hands of its manufacturer. What a bad, bad, bad joke.::Nancy K. Yankow "nky"::1.0::June 14, 2012
R2E5W9D2RU5JP3::Not so great::I've always bought Dell computers because they seem to have a better support system and reliability history than most other brands. I was right about that part--Dell tech support have been very good lately about responding to calls and emails and fixing whatever is wrong. Despite that, I only bought this laptop 7 months ago, and I wasn't expecting to have any type of problem with it for a few years.So what do I like about it?-The keys are very responsive to touch.-It isn't too heavy to lug around.-The size of screen is just about right for the writing work I do.-It has plenty of memory for my docs.-It's fast.-It's starts up and restarts quickly.-The battery lasts a few hours so I can leave the house and expect it to work for a while.What's not to like?-After a few months it started to not come on at all. I was instructed to take the battery out and put it back in, sort of like those pathetic calls you make to your phone company and they tell you to do things that will not fix the long-term problem. Wisdom prevailed, though, and a guy came to the house and fixed it.-Occasionally every single window I have open will start spazzing out on me, flashing up and down before my eyes, sort of like when you open the wrong URL and all the pop-up windows start to display content you never want to see again and you can't close them all fast enough. It won't let me close each window; I have to shut down the computer with all the windows open and start over.-Sometimes the sound and display settings will show up on the screen and won't go away so you have to have a Skype session with the setting box to the side.-The sound system is terrible. I didn't care about the sound to begin with because I never really listen to music on this, but the speakers are underneath so it comes out sounding far less than clear.-The keys are so sensitive that you could tip one accidentally and it will move your tracker to some other place on your document, so you go back to typing and don't realize you're typing two paragraphs up. This is a very persistent problem and drives me crazy.Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this particular model.::Sally "Sally"::2.0::February 15, 2012
R3TRIMQSOE2ATC::TERRIBLE COMPUTER!::Don't ever buy a computer from Dell, ever!  After less than one year, my computer stopped charging.  It was still under warranty (for a few days) and Dell "fixed it" free of charge.  After working for a short period of time, the same issue occurred.  This time, you would have to buy a warranty for $170 to get them to "fix it".  What a scam.  I will never buy a Dell computer again.  Terrible quality, terrible customer service, and a complete rip off.::Bill::1.0::December 7, 2011
R18V554EV3G6ZI::Excellent Computer::I got mine over 20 days ago and so far it has totally met my expectations.I bought this one as replacement for my almost 6 year old Dell Inspiron m6400. I don't understand why people keep bashing Dell like if their computers were meant just to break down, all computers break down regardless of the brand so it is just a matter of giving them the proper care and treatment. However, I must admit I didn't treat my m6400 fairly across time since I banged up the audio port and dropped it a couple of times... and yet it survived and managed to get done almost everything I put in it.Now, for the new baby the things that I've tested/experienced so far:-The wireless performance is great and very easy to setup, although I've not tested it for its max range.-HDMI sync up is way too easy to do.-HDD has not been a problem. I don't see any lockup nor any sign of it been "too slow to respond" like other people have reported. I've used about 50-60 GBs of space so far and have been moving large files back and forth with 2 external drives I have without problem.-Webcam software is a bit tricky to get it to stop loading after you enable video support for Skype or MSN, but besides that the video quality is excellent, at least for my standard.-The Dell quick access toolbar is a bit annoying but it is nothing really to get mad about.-Bloatware is OBVIOUSLY present but it only takes about 10 mins of your time to disable most of the notifications.-CPU performance has been excellent so far, no complaints whatsoever.-LCD screen quality is awesome, I'm not necessarily thrilled with the max resolution but I can't really ask for much when running integrated video.-I've only "burned" 2 DVDs for the recovery software so far. The wizard to get them done was quite user friendly I must say.-The built-in speakers have a very decent quality. You can't expect too much from them but I can say that I've had a couple of Skype calls and didn't have to bother on getting a set of headphones at all.-The material of the computer is quite sturdy and the finish at the bottom is actually something I liked given the fact that I know this tend to capture any residues on the surfaces where the computer may rest upon. Some people have complained about it been "cheap" plastic but I can personally tell you that I've seen more expensive computers with crappier quality and finish so this will not be a concern for me.-The keyboard is a full size with the little trick that the space bar is a smaller than the normal ones but it isn't really a problem.-The design problem of how the FN key works...it is something I'm really used to already so again it is not a problem for me.I'll try to post some pics later on so future buyers, or at least people interested, will have a better chance to look at it than me. I'm from Costa Rica so I really didn't have the option of checking the computer at store before ordering but I did take quite some time researching in different websites for reviews and prices. The best advice I can give to everyone is read, check reviews and ask your tech buddies for advice before buying.There are several "reviews" here just whining about problems with the computer but I can say they are not necessarily accurate since the problems reported are problems that occur to all computer users. If you don't believe, take the time to read customer reviews of any computer brand here in Amazon and you'll see similar reports.::Erick A::5.0::November 7, 2011

My last computer (a Dell) worked GREAT until it fell victim to some kind of horrible virus (well, it was 6 years old) and I had been using my husband's cast-off Toshiba in the interim(I HATE that computer-- see the review) and an older Dell Inspiron which has had so many trips to Rockwall, TX that it should have enough frequent flier miles to orbit the globe (fan issues which constantly cause overheating. And melting.).Anyhow, this new Dell is so much faster and lighter it just blew me away. The set-up was nice and easy and I was able to transfer my (hideously expensive) Microsoft package onto the computer with ease and link up to our 4 printers so quickly I couldn't believe it.  I'm not crazy about how things seem to be organized on my toolbar, but that is probably a function of software rather than the computer. That said, Dell is definitely in the pocket of Microsoft and whoever owns the highly annoying MacAfee security. In order to get my computer connected to the internet I had to accept software options with these programs I would have preferred to leave to a later date. But there was no signing online until I hit the "accept" button. Seriously. NO INTERNET UNTIL YOU MAKE THE DEAL!!If this review makes me sound like a computer idiot, well, that's because I am. To all you other idiots out there who are considering a new computer let me just say that this seems like a nice computer. I realize I will have to send it back to Dell before the warranty expires so they can fix the pixel issue. Just one pixel-- is that a big deal? I don't know. I picture it as some kind of contagion spreading from pixel to pixel to pixel.... (to all of you who feel like you need to educate me on computer hardware, don't waste your precious time. It won't stick, anyhow.)The computer is light, quick and doesn't over heat. Aside from the software extortion routine upon boot up and the blown pixel, I'm happy.::S. G. "s.g."::4.0::October 7, 2011
R1MX8XKEM7763::DONT BUY DELL::I will never buy dell again!  I bought this crap for 600 dollars and the hard drive stopped within 5 months.  But if you dont spend the extra on warranty then they will only repair it.  I think they should stand behind there crap but who am I.  The tech from dell came out to fix it and I heard it fall on the floor while he was working on it.  I called dell right after they left but if the computer doesnt have damage you can see they said we are stuck with this dell crap.  So if you have to have their awful customer service in your house watch to make sure they don't drop it.  I hope people read this and don't buy dell.  There is a reason people love iphones and dell surely doesn't come close to the iphone and how silly is that 600 dollars doesn't compare to a 50 dollar at&t; phone.  When we had no house computer all weekend, my apple phone had no proplem with the extra time we spent on it.  So please if you read this buy some other name computer let this company go belly up so no one else has to have a 600 dollar caluculator.  By the way the computer is still a slow computer, since I bought this it has dragged its feet and it is still slow.::Tina::1.0::October 11, 2011
R17H1SEMC56FIM::Dell inspiron::I just bought my Dell, and I'm using it right now. I have always been a fan of Dell computers, and I still am. The Dell is user friendly, easy to adjust to from previous computers. It's fast...I don't know what else to say other than I love it.::joyfulbowden::5.0::September 27, 2011
R1RGSR2IY8BLOG::Great Price for a DELL::Ordered this laptop for my wife it is a great deal have owned Dell desktops with great reliability so I gave the laptop a shot . It is awesome no problems so far as with all computers some issues will arise but fingers crossed that they are not big ones. The computer arrived in great shape and on time. Amazon stands behind the items they sell and has always been there for me. This laptop is cheaper here then ordering from Dell.com also purchased the red switch cover for it and still beat Dells price. I will update this review if any problems do arise.::P.

RWQIN6OVABCSA::bad screen!!::this is the worst screen i ever seen in my life. I thought that maybe its just my luck and i got a bad laptop. but then i went to Best Buy and saw same exact laptop and the screen looked just as bad in Best Buy.Performance is very good in this laptopbut thats because of new intel chip, if it was not for the bad screen, this would have been a good laptopI was surprised that i was able to play hight quality HD 60fps video without any problemsmy 4 years old macbook cannot play that video without jerking***Update***The reason I thought the screen is bad is because i can see grid lines on the screen.I never seen that before, but there was visible lines running vertically and horizontally that formed a gird. I saw that in the laptop i purchased from amazon as well as in the Best Buy's display unit.I would have returned the laptop if this was for myself, but i bought it as a gift and I had no time to return it.::Ben::2.0::September 11, 2011
RMN6YEN0H582J::Easy to use, good price, a bit slow::The good:-Mine has no screen problems. By the way, my screen is bright and clear at a wide angle of vision.-Still no hard drive problems or any other problems for that matter. I have it for a month.-Easy to use, windows 7 is a good update from my previous windows xp computer.-The price is ok.The not so good:-Comes with a lot of preinstalled stuff. I would prefer to start with a clean install and build from there myself.-Feels slow, in spite of the quad core processor. Actual processing tasks inside the programs (sketchup rendering, for example) are ok,but program loading and boot seem slow.I have a hunch the 5400 rpm hard drive is to blame for that.-Replacing the hard drive with an SSD seems to be insanely difficult and involves disassembling your whole computer ([...])::D.

R18XCG6IVGBCDL::I would no recommend this computer::I currently own this computer and I've had it for a few year now and I wouldn't recommend this computer to anyone. In the beginning it worked lawlessly and then after a couple of months it started messing up and slowing down. Then a month or so later the computer crashed for the first time. After taking it to get fixed and being assured it would never happened again. So when I left for college the following fall I didn't expect to have these issues this fall alone my computer has crashed 3 times and has had countless other issues which resulted in spending hundreds of dollars in anticipation of another crash. The longevity of this project is terrible and is most efficient in the first 6 months of use past that expect serious problems and potentially needing to replace it. This is my second dell computer and I would never purchase one again.::Ashley::1.0::January 2, 2014

I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS EXCEPT THAT ONE OR TWO OF THE LETTERS ON THE KEYS ARE STARTING TO WEAR OFF. I NEVER HAD TO CALL DELL FOR ANY PROBLEMS DESCRIBED HERE BY OTHERS. BOUGHT A WIRELESS MOUSE TO AVOID USING THE BUILT IN ONE THOUGH. NOTICED BATTERY LIFE HAS SHORTENED A LITTLE OVER TIME, BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED. OVERALL, I AM SATISFIED.::GREG BRADY::4.0::December 22, 2013
R38Y2VBH1CMUBP::Buy This Computer? -  Buy Used? - Yes, So Far::Two aspects to this review, this computer, and this computer used.Computer: Dell Inspiron 15R i15RN5110-7223DBK 15.6-Inch Laptop  (Intel Core i3-2310M 2.1Ghz, 6GB DDR3 Memory, 640GB Hard drive, Wifi-N, BlueTooth, USB 3.0, Windows 7 Home Premium) Diamond Black My experience with this unit, while short, has been very positive.  Brilliant display, well constructed, super fast.  Obviously, there are newer/more featured available, but for more money.  This is a second/backup computer for us, and has the ideal price and capabilities for that, plus featured enough to be the first computer if the other one goes out.  Lot of experience with and very happy with Dell computers in general.Used: Have never bought used, decided the gamble was worth the worry.  There was a problem initially with wi-fi that I probably caused, but the vendor was very helpful (see my review for Byte-Sized Solutions).  It feels and looks almost new, all capabilities work as they should, but for a much lower price, so I am very happy with my choice so far.::Boiler::5.0::September 22, 2013
R2I09N1577S1G1::Good enough for me!::Dell Laptops continue to carry the grace that they always have. This system wasn't what i was searching for, it however was good enough to make my customer smile and even pay an additional $70 just for my delivery.::crystal g owonubi::5.0::June 19, 2013

RB2VDO3JK2DM5::my new office::I suffered from "cultural lag" until I got this lap top; I never knew how much better a lap top was than a desktop; it is portable, more efficient, and much faster too. I mainly use it for school. It is very fast. I got a Dell sound system for it for music and now I have stereo sound that is comparable to the top of the line stereo systems! Coupled with unparallelled customer service from Dell this was another wise investment.::L. Khan::5.0::October 29, 2012
R17HKE5TI2KJMG::Dead within a year - last Dell I'll ever buy..::I bought directly from Dell...Less than a year old, but when it was delivered the keyboard was a bit warped. It performed well for months, then [of course] the keyboard problems started. It would mistype in a wonderful variety of ways. The touchpad stopped working a week ago. At that time, the wireless connectivity now to be relinked every other day. I moved my files off to an external the day before the internal drive crashed.I opened the unit up [obviously voiding the warranty - but I'm not buying a Dell again] and the keyboard to circuit board ribbon latch had no secure closure tabs on it! There were a couple of odd bits of masking tape holding this thing to that thing to the other thing. I attempted to reconnect the keyboard to the circuit board with electrical tape but no go. Perhaps I should have used Chinese masking tape. Hard drive was still FUBAR so off to the closet alongside a 2005 Toshiba Satellite that lasted 6 years until the screen blew.Mine will go to an electronics recycler that I'm sure will send all the sh!t back to China to be remade into more laptop components. My wife has 2 similar Dells with no major problems - but I'll reward Dell's product inconsistency by taking my purchases to another manufacturer.::count210::1.0::August 26, 2012

R3NMBKUX15QDEB::Stay away for this or any other Dell computer::I have had this computer for about a year. During that time I had problems with it restarting on it own with out doing any up dates or just shutting down. The screen would become jumbbled and I would have to restart the computer. About a month ago the power supply would no longer the computer I sent in for repair it just came back yesterday. On the repair sheet I told Dell not to replace the hard drive for any reason well they did and i lost some of my data that I could not back up because the battery ran out. Dell really dropped the ball on this one and does not care.  This computer runs really hot even with a cooling pad it hard to type and rest your wrist on the lower left side becasue of the heat.  I used to think Dell was a good compnay and stood behind there systems but I have learned that no longer the case their tech support is very poor and they cant or wont do what you ask and it takes far to long to get a system repaired and when it is reaplaired you can count on having to spend many hours getting all the programs and files reinstalled since they will replace your hard drive even if it does not need it.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS OR ANY OTHER DELL COMPUTER::D. Maloney "Pepaw"::1.0::June 27, 2012
R3NMUGQ1PBLUJE::Dell...the BMW of the laptop industry::I must say that I was nearly discouraged to not buy this laptop based on the myriad of negative reviews I read on it. I took a leap of faith, however, and landed on a cloaked rope bridge between a valley of brown.First, I commend the seller for punctual delivery. I pride myself as a computer expert, and in a quarter of an hour I can tell what is good and what is bad about software or hardware; and I must say this, the ONLY (permit the tone) thing not right about this baby, the 15R, is that it doesn't have an LED indicator I can easily find which tells me when the battery charger is plugged in. And that's it! I can't ask better of a laptop at this price range: 6 gig RAM, 600 gig hard drive...and a 2.4 Ghz chip powering the drivetrain.I have studied Dell for many years, particularly its laptops. They started like early BMWs: sturdy and mechanical. After 1999, the Bimmers started becoming beacons of technology, especially with the intro of iDrive and sequential manual gearboxes. Many were sceptical, but others gradually accepted the new BMW. Its the same with Dell. The 15R is the new BMW M3: cheesy, but it maintains the tradition. Brilliantly. Next time you want to buy a laptop, ask an EXPERT (again excuse the tone)...::Tarachi, Benjamin::4.0::June 14, 2012
R2HUBNH93PBK1I::Computer failed after 2 weeks.::Exactly on the 14th day of owning this laptop the motherboard failed on me. Dell would do nothing about it. Said i only had 10 days test it out after that they will not touch anything! I dont understand, i gave you my hard earned money and you treat me like crap. Two weeks Dell! thats all your motherboard lasted! it was not  my fault and I will never buy from them again. Thanks Amazon for returning it for me i love you guys.::Nickslife89::2.0::April 15, 2012
R1OA2IBHQW0PXV::Dell never again::I had a Dell laptop for at least 8 years. It was a great machine that never gave me problems. I was the buyer for my company and we were very loyal to Dell. With the increasing need for speed and memory I got a new one. This cannot be the same company as my old Dell. The laptop seems very hardy but is full of bugs. It comes with so much crap software including MCfee anti virus and its impossible to take out completely. I have spent more hours trying to fix bugs in this machine than actually using it. Dell no more,,,::Miguel Angel Garcia Garcia::1.0::March 28, 2012
R3I7F5LATVCAYR::Feels cheap and rattles::This has to be the worst laptop ever made as far as durability. The battery is loose and rattles, the DVD drive is loose and rattles, and the lower left corner of the laptop, (when the laptop is open) is "mushy" and creaks when you rest your arm on it to type.Dell, why even bother? Just like everything else in this country, prices go up and quality goes down.::Ibuy2manybooks::2.0::February 25, 2012
RQPEFOGTYN138::Recommended; but not for FPS games::[Note:  I've edited my review on 10/17/2011.  The problem is that this laptop is no longer offered directly by Amazon.  The price varies and shipping isn't always free.  Therefore, it's up to you to make sure you're getting a good deal.]This listing is for the 2011 model Inspiron 17R, while most of the other listings are for last year's product.  I purchased a Dell Inspiron 17R similar to this one for my sister during May 2011.  It's quite impressive as compared to my Asus laptop from less than three years ago.  I would definitely recommend one these to a friend.CASE:  The 17R is surprisingly thin considering that it isn't advertised as a thin laptop.  The Diamond Black finish is very attractive.  [Note: the listings that mention the Mars Black finish are for last year's model.]  The hinge operates smoothly and appears to be durable.LCD:  The quality of a laptop's screen is particularly important to me.  This one is better than most.  It's somewhat glossy but, fortunately, not nearly as glossy as was common a couple of years ago.  Text is a lot easier to read than it was on the ultra-glossy screens.  There appears to be some anti-reflective treatment but it is not overdone.  Viewing angles are quite good horizontally, and are adequate vertically.  You won't need to clamp your head in a vise to use this laptop.  Vertical resolution is 900 pixels, which is as good as it gets without spending twice as much.  Movies and photographs look very good on this widescreen display.SPEAKERS:  Typical mediocre laptop speakers.  They are perfectly intelligible, but you'll want to use headphones for movies or music.WIRELESS:  There is some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that Bluetooth is included, so you won't need any wireless dongles to use a wireless mouse or keyboard.  Also, this current model Inspiron 17R supports the new version of Intel Wireless Display technology [WiDi], allowing you to display your desktop wirelessly to your television at full 1920x1080 resolution.  Of course, you have to buy a second-generation (1080p) WiDi adapter for your television before you can use WiDi.  Suitable second-generation WiDi adapters are available from Belkin and Netgear.  [Note: last year's Inspiron 17R with the Mars Black finish is permanently limited to the first-generation, 720P version of WiDi.  There are some credible reports that even second-generation, 1080i WiDi technology is not quite ready for prime time due to problems with playing DRM protected content.  You need to investigate this for yourself.]The bad news in the wireless category is that there is no support whatsoever for the 5GHz wireless band!  Look up the Wireless-N 1030 adapter on Intel's web site.  Bummer if you live in a crowded neighborhood!PORTS:  This current 17R includes a combo eSATA + USB 2.0 port, plus two USB 3.0 ports and an HDMI 1.4 port.  That's a good reason not to buy the last year's 17R without at least a one-third discount.  The last year's 17r is limited to HDMI 1.3 (translation: will never play a 3-D blu-ray disk in 3-D over HDMI) and doesn't have any of the new, ultra-fast USB 3.0 ports.BATTERY LIFE:  Too soon to tell, but there appears to be at least 3.5 hours available for basic web surfing and watching movies over Netflix.  Battery life could be better than that, but I don't know the limits yet.  In any event, battery life will be significantly better than it was on last year's 17R due to the second-generation i5 CPU.  More on the CPU later in this review.RAM:  Six gigabytes of RAM are included, a nice upgrade from the usual four GB.  It's unlikely that you'll need to bother to upgrade the memory during the laptop's lifetime.VALUE:  There's always a deal at Dell, but the deal changes faster than you can follow.  Dell is throwing in a free Blu-ray combo disk with this particular version of the Inspiron 17R.  My sister's 17R did not include Blu-ray, but it did come with a full copy of Microsoft Office for free, while this 17R only includes the crummy starter edition.  Deals at Dell are a lot like the weather here in New England: if you don't like it, wait a minute.Conversely, I would suggest you jump on this model if the Blu-ray upgrade is what works for you.  It's easy to buy and install a full copy of Microsoft Office at a later date, whereas upgrading the optical drive in a laptop is too expensive and too difficult for the average consumer.CPU:  In case you haven't heard, Intel made a major overhaul of its processor architecture for this Spring.  The new CPUs are code named Sandy Bridge.  For the i3, i5 and i7 lines, Sandy Bridge CPUs are identified by having four digit model numbers versus three digits for discontinued CPUs.This Inspiron 17R uses an Intel i5-2410m processor, identifying it as a new Sandy Bridge CPU.  There are lots of other 17 inch Inspirons available here on Amazon that use last year's models, such as the i5-580m.  Personally, I would not recommend buying a laptop with a discontinued Intel CPU unless there is a discount of at least one-third.  The Sandy Bridge CPUs are significantly more powerful (for an equal GHz rating) while consuming significantly less battery power than their predecessors.In case you were wondering why I said that last year's 17R with the Mars Black finish was limited to the original 720p version of WiDi, now you have your answer: second-generation WiDi only works on computers with Sandy Bridge processors.  Remember, any i3, i5 or i7 processor with a three digit model number is NOT a Sandy Bridge CPU.The i5-2410m is sold only to manufacturers, so a little less information is available than for Intel's retail CPUs.  Retail i5 processors have four physical cores without hyperthreading, but the i5-2410m has only two physical cores with hyperthreading, making it more like an i3.  Calling this CPU an i5 is a bit deceiving.  However, unlike the comparable i3 CPU, turboboost technology is included, allowing the i5-2410m to throttle up to 2.9 GHz when operating on only one physical core.  VT-x virtualization support is included but VT-d is not.  If none of this means anything to you, the bottom line is that the i5-2410m is as good as you need it to be.CONCLUSION:  I probably should have taken one star off for the lack of support for the 5GHz wireless band.  That was a very odd choice by Dell, in my opinion.  Otherwise, this is a very nice laptop that I would recommend to anyone who isn't preoccupied with first person shooter ["FPS"] games.  Game players should read my own comment to this review, regarding AMD's next-generation processor ["Llano"] that will be reaching the marketplace soon.::The Irish Patient::5.0::June 16, 2011
R8EKVTVB4NGC4::Dell Inspiron Laptop::I've had the Dell Inspiron laptop for about a month now, and I'm wondering how I could possibly have lived "BDI" (Before Dell Inspiron). The 17" screen has amazing color and resolution and seems as large as a football field, I'm in the "I'LL Never Have Another Desktop" crowd. I am still discovering all of the bells and whistles, it's lightning fast(I have high speed DSL), more memory than an elephant, and has a built-in web cam. I also purchased the Microsoft Office software and it loaded flawlessly. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. I took advantage of the 6 months no interest offer, which is a great bonus. Shipping was quick and safe. Get one and be happy!::Richard L. Finegan::5.0::August 2, 2011
R1GE6T4ONB5QVR::do not like its touchpad::First of all, 17" is too big to carry around, but I mostly use it at home. I like the keyboard but I hate the touchpad. The touchpad is so big and so sensitive. When I type with keyboard, the touchpad often move cursor to another place. Very annoying.Other thoughts, There is no way to open the bottom so it wont let you update memory or hard drive in the future. do not like this.The battery, I saw some information saying the battery can last 2 hours. It can only last 1 hour. I did charge the battery for more than 12 hours before I turn on laptop.::ETH::4.0::July 23, 2011
R3QEN84L3WRLG4::kick @55!::I love this laptop! its perfect for everything, even gaming. Windows 7 is better than any of its predecessors. the 17" screen is perfect for writing essays and doing other school work, and watching HD movies. the price is right and dell is a great computer company... unlike HP or Apple. It keeps its charge and is the perfect laptop for any purpose. id recommend this laptop to anyone. and the free xbox 360 was great too! (end of summer deal)::Max::5.0::September 22, 2011
R2RUISI3TA5NJI::My first Lap Top::This is my first laptop so not a lot to compare it to, but here goes,  I love the clarity of the display, it is a little slow on the start up but is very fast once it is booted up. The thing I am most disappointed in is the battery life, I may get 2 hours if I'm lucky. Overall it is a good machine and I haven't had any problems at all.::Janine Peace::4.0::September 29, 2011
R17BZBY4SC3PJD::Dell Inspiron::It's a Dell, what else can I say.  I've had Dells before and I am never disappointed. It is fast, clean and easy to handle and the price was right.  Amazon was quick and efficient.::Geoge::5.0::December 16, 2011
R22ZZ19AJCIO6D::Outstanding laptop!::This model of Inspiron is user friendly,powerfull,and responsive! Many extras and Blu-Ray too make this a great value for the money spent. This is the second laptop I've owned and it is,by far, superior to my previous laptop. I would recommend this laptop for multipurpose use and for turbo speed performance!::Douglasmagee "Sarge"::5.0::October 30, 2011
R2RZX8VIMUHZYO::Very uncomfortable::This would be an excellent computer if you were using it with an external keyboard and mouse, but the front edge is sharp and hurts the palms of my hands after a short time.  There is a lip on the front that protrudes and will leave an indention in your palms when using the touch pad, causing discomfort.  This can be quite painful after extended use.  Most laptops have a rounded front edge, not so much with this one.  This type of discomfort could be isolated to those of us with large hands.The other CONS for me are the keyboard layout and touch pad.  I thought I would like the keys being farther apart from one another, but I didn't care for this feature.  I found that I had to look down at the keys while typing, more so than I would have with a typical keyboard.  Maybe with time this can be overcome.  The touch pad swipe features are cool when they work.  If you don't touch the sweet spot just right you'll find yourself frustrated after a bit.  I messed with the sensitivity and all other touch pad settings and it still was not as responsive as I would like.  I also had issues with the pointer jumping all over the screen.  This was not due to the touch pad being inadvertently grazed by my hand.  This was not a constant problem, but it did happen daily.The touch pad left and right buttons "are not" the quiet type.  I don't like the loud click type buttons and I wish that this would have been listed in the description.  If you or others around you are the type to be bothered by this, look elsewhere.The speed of the computer is good, the large display is GREAT and the BRD player was a nice feature, but for someone who likes to use their laptop in their lap at home on the couch or in bed, this may not be the most comfortable laptop for you.I called Amazon and spoke with a Customer Service Rep and was told they don't handle 3rd party returns or exchanges.  I thought I would have received more help than that.  I wasn't happy with this so I went to the Amazon returns page and started the return process there.  Low and behold I had a response from the 3rd party seller in less than an hour with return instruction.***UPDATE*** 5 Feb 2014I decided to keep the laptop and I've been using it daily for over 2 years now.  It is a great multi-purpose computer and I would recommend it.PROS: Awesome display, love the keyboard now, movies, games, word processing, graphic design all perform very well.  No performance complaints at all.CONS: I still hate the front lip as it is very uncomfortable. The hinges are not as smooth and have begun to get very stiff and making a cracking noise.  The upper left screen bezel has cracked (no rough handling, just normal opening and closing of the lid) I'll be replacing the hinges and bezel soon. It takes several minutes to connect wirelessly to the internet. The left/right touch pad buttons are noisy. Battery life has been reduced to about 1.5 hours during constant use (fairly normal battery issue).::Nick F.::3.0::November 8, 2011
RWCXZB3P59U1W::Do not get this laptop::Ok, maybe now almost a year later it might have had the bugs fixed. I will tell you I have had NOTHING but trouble with this laptop. I'm using my old Inspiron 15 from about what, 10 year or so?First, the cursor had the hopping issue so you couldn't even type an email much less do any work on Word. Then, after a fix was published NOT by Dell but by someone who was experiencing the same issue.Then, can't load VPN from work, will NOT allow me to download the most important fix SP 7 I think...Basically, when I have time to watch an extremely old video I log on to this account at Amazon and watch a movie.p.s. the issue is I don't have time to stay on hold forever and try to maneuver the whole "help" thing (tried four times) but always give up and go back to the oldie moldy.When I truly have time and money I will just take it to a computer store and PAY to have it fixed. Did I tell you it cost me over $2,000 dollars? Buyers beware.::No Hidden Agenda::1.0::September 14, 2012
R2FI27W5CCSCUL::Dell Inspiron 17" Laptop::I have had this laptop for less than one-year and have had MAJOR problems with it. The hard drive is about to crash & I will need to replace the hard drive if I plan to keep this piece of junk.  The battery (which never held a charge for more than 90 minutes) no longer charges at all (needs a new battery).  As the saying goes: "You get what you pay for".  I had a Dell laptop 7 years ago which crashed in less than 2 years.  I thought in the last 7 years maybe Dell improved.  I had an Apple MacBook Pro for YEARS and the only reason I bought another laptop was due to the keyboard beginning to fall apart on the Apple.  I should have just bought another MacBook.  So:  Customer Beware!!!!::Peggy Stepro::1.0::September 2, 2012
R3CUKN2HTEFQFB::Adorable computer, if only it worked::I bought this computer because it was a small and tablet and it had decent specs for a netbook. When it works it's great. It runs windows 7 wonderfully for web browsing and document editing. It is lacking in reliability.I had to send it back to Dell 1 month after I purchased it because it wouldn't turn on. Dell replaced the motherboard. Around 5 months after the first repair I had to send it back in to have the palm rest(touch pad) repaired. Now, 2 months after the second repair and 8 months after purchase it won't turn on again and is going to be sent back.I don't know about the rest of the world but I don't expect to have a computer fail 3 times in less than 9 months. I have had 2 other Dell laptops which have had no problem this model is poor quality and not up to dell's normal standards, or they have lowered their standards::Kindle Customer "Shaina"::1.0::October 20, 2011
R2RAVULQWQZQ5D::The DOCK Makes It::The duo itself makes a fine small (10.1") computer and is quite capable even though it is a tad slow but it's not a powerhouse desktop either.  When the Duo is added to the Dock it makes a fine pair.  Sound from the stand alone Duo is minimal and barely a strength; however, when the Dock is added it makes a significant difference but, again, it is not a large set of stereo speakers either.  I usually turn mine on in the morning and let it run most of the time just to hear the background, music or internet radio.  I use an 8Gig flash drive to hold music and pictures; however, when I pair it with the desktop it will take several thousand Picasa pictures and show pictures all day.  This is not a tablet but a netbook computer and well worth it.  When it's time to go to the doctor and wait for what seems like forever I have my handy laptop and can use it for about 3 hours since my docs office has wireless.::John N.

R1IAURUQBJML02::Fabulously Fun, but itsy-bitty battery charge::I have been waiting to get this.  I love the multiplicity of it, but the battery charge is barely usable!  I had an HP mini with a battery usage ability of NINE (9) hours!  I knew this wasn't going to be THAT good, but didn't expect to have to charge it repeatedly in ONE (1) day!!  I'm a full-time college student as well s a homeschooling mom of 6, I do NOT like to be tied to a plug!  If there were anything else wrong with this, I would send it back ASAP!  However, I will learn to make do.  Just wanted to share this tidbit for anyone else that needed that little piece of 411!::Amazon Customer::4.0::September 14, 2011
RS2GWHPBPPEWJ::Awesome::Love this netbook. The flip screen makes it even more fun. Not bulky in the tablet mode. Down fall is battery life.::Artz::4.0::July 17, 2011
R1PYLMREYY36RJ::Great small PC::I replaced a 1 year old Toshiba Netbook with the Duo. There is no comparsion.  Even ignoring the difference in HD size.  The Dell just works wonderfully.  I have no issues with battery power, it lasts close to 4 hours, which is plenty. The screen is beautifly clear and the switch to a tablet works well. I bought directly from Dell however since they are now using a higher performance processor (also more energy efficient) that what is listed on Amazon. Also, I didn't want black. The keyboard is great and the mouse pad works better than anyone elses version that I have found.  I love the docking station. I also added Android apps which I find very usefull.  Dell's pricing was better than any sellers on Amazon as well. But, check around, that can change.I cannot explain the few bad reviews, I am very happy with the device and it's perfomance. I have been in the industry for many years, so I know how to evaluate performance properly. We have 6 dell PC's in the house and have never had a issue with any.  Maybe some do not know what to expect or how to understand what PC specs mean.::Mud Ducky "semi Cheesehead"::4.0::December 9, 2011
R372FLZI4DIOO3::Don' bother.......Unless you are an IT pro wanting to work on it constantly!::I bought this a little over a week ago from a different retailer and have spent about as much time dealing with idiots at Dell who can only read a script as using it. It ran VERY slow from day one. I did all updates and everything I could think of to speed it up. All I wanted it for was basics like surfing the web, email and video watching. Well it did none of those well. Web pages moved slow and kerky when you tried to scroll them, same with videos both on the web and on the machine and I gave up on email since I was too busy trying to get it working.Of course the award winning Dell support in India had nice little scripts to read me to help. When you understood them over the cracking phone lines and accents it was OK as long as it followed their script. First thing was to try and run the tests, no problem except the tests which are part of the BIOS failed to launch. That should have been the first big flag on it! When that failed, they had me restore it to factory condition. Ok, easy enough and not like 15 years in IT would give me a few clues on this. I managed to do the restore no problems but then you have to run all those updates yet again. In between updates I did some of the basics like installing Office, seeing if it ran faster on videos and web and etc and it never did any better at those items.Then it suddenly started failing to boot on a restart with no screen at all showing. Several hard power downs and it finally booted to the BIOS to say it couldn't find an operating system!?!? Ok, hard boot down yet again to try and it manages to come up fine. At this point BIG red flags are wavign and alarm bells all over the place! Then it starts to update the recoverey partition from Dell and it did a blue screen of death near the end after the program had given a lot of warnings about not to power down or etc or it would risk damaging the system and etc.Ok, call that award winning service in India yet again. Oh, we need to run the diagnostics that they already knew it was not able to get in to and I told them when I explained the reason for my call. Well, we need to repair th operating system, the one it said it couldn't find at one point and you get after the BIOS boots that I pointed out it was showing major issues with. Also after I had been very careful to point out that the BIOS was showing serious problems and repairing things like this is what I do so may have a clue on the issue. Well maybe they would send me the OS disks to reinstall the OS that way? Yeah, the OS that won't load frequently because the BIOS doesn't load to be installed on a laptop from the disks when the laptop has no CD or DVD in it? Nope, not my job to fix this machine unless they wanted to pay me the $55 an hour standard rate for me to do my WORK on it.Yeah, one week old and this junk is going back to the retailer who DO have 24 hour support in the USA who can do more than read a script, understand the difference between an operating system and BIOS and don't expect me to repair a brand new laptop I just paid them hundreds of dollars for or to mess around with it until past the return date has past. I'll stick with HP who I can actually get people who know english, the difference between the BIOS and OS and have always been able to get me a higher level of tech support on request without me having to spend days on the phone begging while Tier 1 guys read me a script. They also are able to look in their database and see my name and info without as much cross referencing info as well as that I am an IT pro who deal with them at work too. Dell is too busy employing people in India with scripts for me to EVER touch their stuff again. Maybe if it works they are great but if that is their version of award winning service and support, I will stick to those who DO the job instead of buying awards to brag about!::Quentin0352::1.0::November 26, 2011
RBMVFWPUNZHG7::Better than I expected::From the reviews, I expected my new Duo to be slow. It's not. It's much faster than other netbooks I've used. I didn't get it expecting lightning speed, but I haven't noticed it being much slower than my 17" laptop that has twice the RAM and a faster processor. I also haven't tried doing anything I knew it can't handle. I originally intended to put in a SSD to speed it up, but I don't think it's necessary now.I've heard bad things about the Dell Stage (what happens when you switch to tablet mode). Mine updated right away, so maybe that's why it doesn't lag. The only thing I had to remove right away was McAfee, to install my preferred anti-virus. Windows has been updating a lot, of course. I hope it isn't one of the updates that slows it down. Service Pack 1 hasn't.It's also a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that isn't a bad thing. It isn't the same size as an HP Mini, which is about the size I anticipated. Not sure why, but I just pictured it smaller. I feel much better about the price after seeing how huge this thing is.One last thing. The dock is really great. The sound is much better than the Duo's speakers. It's nice to be able to put the netbook into the dock at night and just let it charge. I don't trust the power cord for the Duo itself. My last Dell went through several of those cords because of the weight-like thing that goes right by the power jack, and the jack itself ended up separating from the motherboard because of the weight. Netflix is good on the dock, too. The only thing I'd like to do that I haven't found a way to do is change the background for the dock clock thing.::Encyclops::5.0::October 4, 2011
R2DIIMY5KS2UIA::Super slow and Terrible Customer service from DELL!!!::I purchased this for my husband as a father's day gift and order it early so it would be there by father's day! Received it and has been nothing but a nightmare.*Don't buy from Dell directly, terrible customer service and terrible return policy on their items.  The computer arrived late and from the moment we turned it on the nightmares began.*The start up speed is so slow, I can basically turn it on and take a bubble bath and it will still be trying to get to the desktop.*The web speed is horrible.  We have super speedy internet connection and even with that the computer took forever just to go from one page to another.*When I tried to contact Dell and return it for something else, they told me from the minute you place the order your days to return it count!  Only 21 days to use and check out your computer to see if you like it.  They delivered it to me on the 11th day!  I fought hard to explain to them that 10 days is not enough time to use such an item and especially if you don't use it everyday.No way did I win on that.Now we are stuck with this super slow laptop/tablet wanna be, which keeps breaking down on us and it's only been 2 months! I suggest if you purchase a Dell product make sure you know your return days and check the date from purchase to the date of delivery.  Also, Costco has a much better policy and warranty for all their products, even Dell items.Now we are without a laptop, since it's out for repairs!::icrews23 "icrews"::1.0::September 16, 2011
R3UVBQ7CQ5ETMN::Better than most reviews claim.::Recently I found out that for college I needed to have a tablet for the Adobe Suite. Since drawing tablets are fairly expensive I figured I would just buy a tablet pc (since the price range is so close) so that instead of just a touch pad, I'd be able to Photoshop on the screen. So far this netbook is AMAZING!!!! I downloaded Photoshop and was dreading that it'd be all laggy or something based on so many of the comments I had read, but to my amazement it worked. There is absolutely NO lag when I am drawing on the screen (although I did have to tweak the tablet and pen settings). Honestly, I can't find anything bad about it. It is very well built and sturdy. It is a little heavier than say an ipad, but this netbook has all the capabilities of any computer and doesn't run just straight apps like most tablets tend to do. I am not sure how there are so many bad reviews with lag. I mean if I downloaded photoshop, and that program uses tons of ram and resources and works with no lag, then why are so many people having this problem? For graphic design and animation I cannot afford lag as it will slow down my work process, but I found the make of it, the speed, and the hard drive space superb! Also, the docking station works really well. It is great for viewing as well as editing with sound. The speakers are very crisp. Overall, this laptop exceeded my expectations and for half the price, could probably compare to a higher end graphic arts tablet pc. I do suggest that if you WANT it for drawing and art, get two different pen styluses, one with a larger tip and one with a ballpoint tip, for broader strokes (shading) and really fine strokes (lineart).::Brittany::5.0::February 13, 2012
R8T1ZOLQN9FAM::Love It::I bought this about 8 months ago with the docking station and love it. It does run a little bit slower (not that bad) compared to some other laptops but this laptop is made to be portable. It is powerful enough to run Photoshop and play some games online. The sound on the docking station is good quality. The only down fall is the battery power. I get 2-3 hours depending on what I am doing. About an hour if using something like Photoshop.::Roxie::5.0::November 21, 2011
R3T5PWKDBMI46U::Please do not buy this model::This model is the worst.  There is an inherent flaw in the design that cannot process static properly (forgive me as I don't know exactly what happens), so without warning the screen will turn fuzzy, like a TV channel with no reception.  I have been working with Dell for almost 2 months to correct this problem.  They "fixed" my initial computer twice and it still is doing it.  Then they sent me a replacement unit which also does it.  I am now awaiting a new unit model replacement.  There is a forum on Dell's website where there are HUNDREDS of units doing this.  Please, please, please do not buy this model!::Lisa Burke::2.0::February 22, 2012

It had never been dropped  and sat on my bed on a laptop table. it has been a nightmare I have had two other dells that I loved a inspiron 1501 and dell inspiron 1520 so I was happy to purchase another from dell but from now on i plan to purchase older laptops that were before dell started making there laptops so light and cheap.::suzanna::1.0::March 5, 2014
R1C6FI5T85CDOA::Very Poor Customer Support::Wow!  So frustrating!  Just spent 48 minutes on my now 4th call to Dell "Custormer Care", who doesn't seem to care (or have the ability to care), at all! Dell Driver Download Manager updated the software for the fingerprint reader on my Vostros 3550 laptop, and now it doesn't work. I called Dell to see if I could get the previous version of the software, but Tech Support's owner registration info doesn't match what Customer Care has. I registerd the laptop in my name when I purchased it new from BestBuy (BestBuy bought it from Buy.com. I have no idea who they buy from...)  Now Customer Care is telling me to contact  "them" to see if I can find out who purchased the computer! I PURCHASED THE COMPUTER AND REGISTERED THE COMPUTER THE DAY I BOUGHT IT! I HAVE THE RECEIPT'S AND MASTER PACKING SLIP FROM BUY.COM, but according to Dell, I don't own it!  Customer Care won't tell me who "they" are (the people I'm supposed to contact that it is supposedly registered to), but expects me to contact "them" to straighten out the registration. Also told me that my warranty is invalid until I get Dell's error straightened out!  Dell's records concerning the registration of my computer are in error, but they expect me to correct it by contacting an unknown entitiy.

Argenton::3.0::March 15, 2014
R27ZPF24ZAN8R8::Pretty good, but can be better.::I got the latest XPS 17 aka L702x last month to replace an HP Pavilion dv6. The specifications are,CPU: i7-2630QMDRAM: 6GB DDR3-1333Screen: 17.3in FHD 3DGPU: GeForce GT555M 1GBHard Drive: 640GBOptical Drive: Blu-ray burnerBattery: 9-cellOS: Windows 7 Home Premium.My first impression is that the XPS is huge compared to the HP, even though the screen is just 1 inch bigger. The weight is also substantially greater. The 9-cell battery protrudes from the bottom, making it even harder to fit into tight space. Although the 9-cell is supposed to extend the battery life, I get just under 3 hours in mixed usage. So, the XPS is a desk-top replacement through and through. If mobility is an important consideration, the XPS 15 can be had with the same CPU and screen resolution, and will be a much better choice.In terms of computing power, the XPS does not disappoint. The i7-2630QM is capable of 8 threads simultaneously, and I have not experienced any slow-down so far due to CPU overload. The GT555M can run all the latest 3D games if the graphics is set to low quality, but it gets really hot and loud, not to mention the quick battery drain. For gaming, a good desk-top remains the best option. The XPS comes with a pair of 3D glass, but I have not had the urge to try it out either for movie, because of the lack of interesting media, or for games, due to the heat and noise the GPU generates. I intend to use the computer for numerical work, and the CPU, the memory system and the hard drives are the key components.6GB of memory and a 5400-rpm drive do not match well with the high-performing 2630QM, and I had planned to upgrade them right after the purchase. Once the machine arrives and gets its belly opened up, however, I am shocked to find just 2 SODIMM slots. Dell is advertising "up to 16GB RAM" in 4GBx4 configuration, and this is clearly not the case. After some exhaustive research, I finally find the explanation in an obscure Dell customer forum. It turns out that, to save literally a few pennies, Dell has used two different motherboards in the same model: one with 4 SODIMM slots and 3GB of GDDR RAM, the other with 2 SODIMM slots and 1GB of GDDR RAM. I had noticed and got puzzled by the $170 price difference when one stepped up from the GT555M 1GB to the GT555M 3GB. This kind of explains Dell's thought process in the pricing hierarchy. Still, I am upset that Dell fails to explain any of this on its website because there are customers like myself who do not care about the graphic RAM but do want to have the potential to upgrade to 16GB of system memory. I had paid $300 extra compared to HP dv7 for Dell exactly because XPS was supposed to be a premium brand without too much corner-cutting, but I under-estimated Dell's capacity for taking advantage of their customers. In the end, I can only replace the 2GB SODIMM with a 4GB module. The swap costs me $30 after the old SODIMM is sold on ebay, still much less than what Dell would have charged me to upgrade to 8GB memory in the factory.Upgrading the hard drives, on the other hand, is something that the designers of XPS obviously take into account. The XPS comes with 2 drive bays, with the 640GB drive occupying the first one only. I have a new Crucial RealSSD C300 - Solid state drive - 64 GB - internal - 2.5" - SATA-600 ready and just have to move the 640GB drive to the second slot before replacing the SSD in the primary drive bay. Unfortunately, these drive bays are covered with aluminum shields that are attached to the motherboard with tiny screws. I strip one of the screw heads by using a driver a little too large. This necessitates some drilling followed by the application of a screw extractor. The whole process is extremely scary because of the danger of breaking the motherboard, and should be avoided if at all possible. In the end, I have to say that installing the SSD is quite straightforward if I had not had the accident with the screw. Once the hardware is in place, I reinstall the OS with the DVD which had cost me $19 extra, and wipe the 640GB drive to use for data. All the drivers are either included in a free DVD or can be downloaded from Dell's support site easily. The applications such as PowerDVD, however, are nowhere to be found. I have to call Dell support line and have the DVDs shipped to me, but they are at least free of charge. All together, the pre-installed softwares including the OS take up 30GB, leaving 29GB of usable space ("64GB" drives really have only 59GB of usable space in another case of misleading vendor advertisement.) on the SSD for other applications.Once the upgrades are done, I am very happy with the performance of the machine. The SSD really makes a big difference. Windows 7 boots up at under 15 seconds and shuts down in 10. For this alone, I am willing to endure the bulk of the XPS 17 for the dual drive bays. Overall, however, I am somewhat less happy with Dell than HP for three reasons:1. The HP dv6 just seemed more tightly put together;2. I did not experienced misleading feature descriptions with HP;3. I miss the fingerprint scanner on the HP notebook.========================== Added 9/2/2011 ==========================I replaced the boot drive on another PC with an SSD recently. This was an older computer and the drive had been cluttered with various files and programs. Reinstalling everything seemed impractical, so I went looking in download.com for a drive-cloning software. I tried Acronis first, but it was extremely buggy and the trial version did not allow downsized cloning. Eventually, I found EaseUs Todo Backup Free 3.0. It worked very well and, as the name suggested, was totally free. If I have to do it again, EaseUs is the way to go.========================== Added 3/20/2012 ==========================Although Intel does not officially support 8GB SODIMM modules with the HM67 chipset used in this Dell, intrepid users have tried them and generally found the new denser format to work just fine. As the price for these new SODIMM comes down, I give it a try as well and it works! Now this XPS sports 16GB of DRAM even though Dell has seen fit to equip it with only two SODIMM slots.::M. Wang::4.0::May 27, 2011
RUU2FLNRH9R21::Terrible Customer Service::I bought a Dell XPS 17 directly from Dell. It came with a defective screen. So I called Dell. The screen replacement was on back order, but they said they could ship me a replacement computer with identical specs immediately. I received the replacement computer just two days later. Unfortunately the replacement computer had severely downgraded specifications. 900p screen instead of the 1080p screen, i7-2630 processor instead of i7-2720, gt550m graphics instead of gt555m.In every way possible they replaced my computer with inferior components.I immediately called Dell and proceeded to be put on hold and bounced around for over 6 hours trying to get the issue resolved.As I write this I am on hold yet again with a Dell representative who is completely unable or unwilling to assist me.I cannot speak to anyone in the United States for support without paying an additional $250 for some support package::J. Kramer::1.0::June 14, 2011
RM7BQFVFP1EC1::Dell computers are not the wonderful buys they used to be::I bought this computer in 2011 and have had nothing but trouble with it.  Almost every piece of it has been replaced at least once.  I have had three keyboards, and I still have trouble with typing.  I have had to reformat the hard drive three times, because Dell techs couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I decided recently that I wanted to upgrade the hard drive from 500gb to 750gb, and I thought I would be getting a faster hard drive.  Dell gave me the specs on one made by Samsung that they said would fit.  I ordered it from Amazon, and it didn't fit into the laptop.  So I ordered one from Dell and was told it would be delivered on June 5.  It wasn't.  The email they sent said to check for a tracking number, so I tried that and couldn't retrieve one.  I called Dell and got two different answers:  one, it must be in stock or we wouldn't have sold it to you; two, it isn't in stock, and we don't know if or when it will be, but we will find out.  Today I get a third answer; it isn't in stock, but the expected delivery date is June 12; since it isn't in stock we don't know when it will ship, but you have to wait until June 12.  One suggestion a customer service rep offered today is to buy a hard drive from Walmart or Staples who he assured me would know which brand and model would fit this computer.  I don't trust either place to have the right answer.  One option is to just buy a new computer, but this one was too expensive to discard after little more than two years.  Besides the OS is Windows 7, and I've read too many negative things about Windows 8 to even try it.::S. Piper::1.0::June 6, 2013
R1H0G7KN3DT7Y5::Manly machine::I don't know what some of these people who are saying the hardware and the build quality is poor are talking about. I have two of these computers and both of them are still running fast and smooth and I have never had to replace any parts on either of them. They are  the most reliable computers I have ever had. It comes with all the bells and whistles you want too; full hd, backlit keyboard, blueray, multi-touch pad, full size keyboard, hdmi and DP ports, dedicated graphics card, usb 3.0, e-sata port, etc...

R347V9ETBDV2DD::Mac's are starting to look good::PROS: Display is nice, weight not too bad, keyboard is good, speakers are awesomeCONS: Extremely unreliable, battery not great, track pad not good, and some serious hardware issuesOVERALL: This product is not worth your money.When I bought it, it wouldn't play dvd's. Had to waste hours of my time dealing with completely lame customer service to get it fixed. Even after that, problems continued to pile up, conveniently right after the warranty ran out. USB ports will stop working randomly. The track pad, which isn't good to start with, sometimes will turn permanently on, making typing difficult, or not work at all. Last of all, using Photoshop makes the graphics card (which is supposedly good) crash my computer on a daily basis.CONCLUSION: I will never buy a Dell again after how I was treated as a consumer.::amazonisgreat::2.0::May 3, 2013

When I did click on the link I was wasn't let down by the specs listed because I knew this was a laptop that that had the potential to be beefed up. If it wasn't for the good things I've herd about the XPS 17 I would have never clicked the link, and after I did I saw the specs listed in the title weren't even as good as I hoped, but when I checked the other new XPS 17's by other users, which was Hayley's because she was the only person that had some listed for sale, The specs blew me away and came with a Dell one year warranty, I was shocked. The equivalent XPS on the Dell site was selling for more but the specs listed for the XPS Hayley is selling here on Ebay, but the specs reflected what I thought a High Performance Dell XPS 17 should be.I highly recommend this laptop if your looking for a great overall high performance laptop and the warranty it comes with can be renewed.::LpTpGuy2012::5.0::May 17, 2011

We purchased it as a birthday gift for him, and it took a little while longer getting to us than it was supposed to but when I brought this to the companys attention, they were very prompt in their response and it was sent out the next day. It is a great purchase and my son really enjoys it! :)::Maryiah::5.0::December 9, 2013

RCRM25ERIPHBN::For casual use::We ordered 2 for our middle schoolers to use for homework & web searching and for that reason alone they are good.  They were both pretty beat up and came with power cord--which was great considering the battery life is limited. We will have to replace the batteries at some point because they don't hold much charge.  Neither one came with any disks (as was shown in pic) but they did have Microsoft Office 7.Generally speaking we got what we paid for.::marlo Noonan::4.0::August 13, 2013

R3SH8GSDLCIQ39::Older model but it works.::As a person who is still on a budget because of the economy, this was a suitable option and price range for my purpose. Of course the battery is useless, i knew it would be, but I'll just replace it when i can. Mine came with windows vista business, so long as it had windows i was happy.This product is working fine so far, it's an older model so it may need to have some newer drivers installed to operate the new plug and play products like optical mouses, but but my printer booted up fine with no driver disk needed.The seller answered my questions promptly, i would purchase from this seller again.::joe larson::4.0::April 23, 2013
R13J1BU5VXBVJ7::Got a refurbished one::I've had this for about three years. The first year - I watched a lot of videos and listened to a lot of music, and it worked like a charm. It was super fast. Enjoyed it so much!After about a year, it started lagging on webpages. Two years - it heats up over opening more than one or two tabs on Chrome. Forget watching 10+ minute videos. And don't even think about adding a webcam - so much lag. The battery will hardly last an hour when unplugged now. It used to last 3 or 4 hours.SUMMARY:-Fast loading/web surfing for about a year-Alright speed after 1.5 years-After 2 years, best use is for word documents and minimal web-surfing. Can handle a video after it's been off a while.WHO DO I RECOMMEND THIS FOR?-I recommend this computer to people who have a designated spot for it (it's a bit heavy - I would never carry it around), and would like something to send emails, use word documents, simple programs like MS Paint, and watch a short video every now and then. Anyone who intends to use this computer for more than 2 hours at a time will probably be frustrated with its speed after owning it for 2 years.OVERALL:I enjoyed using it for music and videos while it was new. I still like it, but I mostly use it to type up word documents (luckily, I'm a writer. Otherwise, this computer wouldn't have gotten much use after its performance shot down), check my email, and look at a couple webpages. I use the family computer to do pretty much all of my web surfing now. Three stars!::Dominique::3.0::May 26, 2014
R18XVQSTAWPMV9::Meh::It arrived quickly and you can use it to surf the web and download pictures and such but, the description lead me to believe that i could watch movies and burn dvd's along with cd's and so far i haven't been able to do any of that which was a big part of wanting a laptop in the first place. I suppose i should have spent the extra $100 or so and got a better newer laptop, i just heard bad things about windows 8 and wanted an older version laptop. I'm not a computer wiz but i thought i could trust the description.::Jesse strange::1.0::April 30, 2014

R1MQP03VKUREE2::good but have had to replace battery and supply cord twice in a year::I bought this computer just over a year ago and while it is a great laptop (secondary) I've had to replace the battery and power supply twice in a year and it will not play videos from youtube or other sites. It still does a good job but if I'd realized how often I'd have to replace stuff I probably would have paid a little more and got something a little better.::J Oliver::4.0::March 5, 2014
R134RQ3CCQSEHB::laptop was hard to figure certain things out.::I purchased this laptop for a Christmas present for my son and it was very difficult for him or myself to use.

R21707HOWJVG5R::Very Impressed::I needed a VERY inexpensive computer for my worker to use at the scanning station.  This arrived very quickly and is actually a very nice machine.  All we will be using it for is scanning documents and burning CDs so it may not be fast enough for more complex users but it sure is nice to have this machine here.  (The old one literally died right as I was bringing this one over to the station).  It jumped right on the internet.  it did have that annoying "Do you want Norton Antivirus" crap on the first bootup but I got rid of that.::Legal Eagle "working gal"::5.0::July 16, 2013
R3M1JHL1NHYY8K::Best Value For The Money and Great For Everyday Use::Although this is a review for the Compaq CQ62-423NR, I have also included other information so that you can benefit more from computing if you need it.I got mine at Fry's at a very good price. TigerDirect has this, too. There are much fewer user reviews there, plus the reviews are heavily edited by TD, which means they may be less useful. That's why I come to Amazon to read and write reviews, even if I didn't buy the product here.The Compaq CQ62-423NR has an Intel Celeron 900 CPU running at 2.2 Ghz, 3 Gb of RAM, and 320 Gb of hard drive. Unless you are a heavy gamer or do lots of Photoshop or AutoCAD work, you shouldn't be concerned that this may be too under-powered. If all you do are everyday tasks such as Internet browsing, email, YouTube, word processing, spreadsheet, etc., this is perfectly suitable. Overall, the computer feels fast and responsive.While fast, the CQ62-423NR runs very cool. I used Speccy to get a reading of the PC's specifications and operating temperatures. The CPU, motherboard, hard drive ran at 32, 36, and 34 degrees, respectively. It is very comfortable to have it sit on my lap, compared to my 4-year old HP DV7 (Core 2 Duo P7350), which has a corresponding readings of 76, 70, and 43 degrees! A cool computer is also more reliable and lasts longer.This computer does not have a built-in webcam, but you can always add one later via the USB port. I'd recommend one made by Logitech or Microsoft.This 15.6 inch notebook computer does not have a numeric keypad like most in this size category, but it does have dedicated and programmable keys on the leftmost column for things like email, CD player, Internet browser, Print, and Calculator. On the rightmost column, there are navigation keys for home, PgUp, PgDn, and end that are more intuitive to use than horizontally arranged keys for these functions on keyboards with a numeric keypad.The built-in Internet Explorer always feels sluggish. You should use other browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc), because they are mostly more speedy, more memory-efficient, and have more features. I like Chrome the best.Also, you should get a system optimization software to keep your computer in good shape all the time. I use Tune-Up Utilities ($30), but you can try a free one by Glary Utilities first. I like Tune-Up Utilities because you can pretty much set and forget; it will constantly keep your computer in an optimal state.Additionally, I recommend a free program called "meminfo" (by Carthagosoft) to keep track of your PC's memory usage and "defragment memory" when necessary. You can configure the software to show you in the lower right corner of the screen how much memory you have left (in percentage, to be more useful) as you use your computer. You can right-click on the indicator and select "Memory Defragmentor" to reclaim memory used by programs that you have quit using. This is a lot more useful and convenient than having to restart your computer from time to time to remedy a sluggish computer.There is a website called ninite.com which lists a whole bunch of well-known, often used, and free programs in many categories that you can select then install all at once, without any more human intervention. This is the quickest way to have your computer populated with useful programs, and it's free. Not only that, if you keep the setup file, you can run the file at a later date and it will update all those programs automatically. This is really a time-saver and I highly recommend it.::Consumer Advocate::5.0::August 1, 2011
R2J7N3P41DV5UK::Compaq Presario CQ 423::I also purchased this laptop for $260 at Fry's, Anaheim and am very pleased.  The quality is better than most.  I did buy a wireless Microsoft 4000 mouse at Staples for $14 and that made it more comfortable and faster to surf the net.  I also own a Compaq Presario desktop and have been happy with it for over six years.  I have yet to find a laptop with 3gb and 320 hardrive, Altec Lansing speakers, etc for less money.  Highly recommend.::BillPen::5.0::June 14, 2011
R1VZLTXSN6CYWY::Great little notebook::I was iffy about purchasing a notebook from Amazon but this particular model was recommended to me by a friend, all in all this notebook is great for surfing the web, downloading movies, music etc.. is slow at starting up but after initial start up runs pretty fast, does not have webcam or hdmi but it is solid and I would recommend it for students.::Cassie::5.0::September 6, 2011

R2V7S3N935VA7F::Great computer for the $$$::I bought this 2 years ago at frys for $260. It's been great and super functional for my purposes. 98% I use it for web surfing and email.  I don't do any gaming. I don't know what some of these some of these negative (1&2 star) reviews are about, maybe they got a bad one, happens with all manufactures. The reviewer that said the keys were hard to read must have been blind, the font takes up 1/3+ of the key, makes me wonder what his motive was. I haven't had any wifi connection problems, and I'm at Starbucks and Mc D all the time. The battery life was an issue, 2 1/2 hrs, but I knew that when I bought it. I picked up an aftermarket battery on ebay for $39 and now get 6 hrs. It's not a $1000 gaming laptop, but its been great for the $$$ and my needs. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.::RICK DENISCO::4.0::January 9, 2014

R36Q7FVGYR1X8L::Incredible Value::I purchased this Acer Aspire laptop in refurbished condition in late August of 2011 for under $250.00. Since then I have increased the factory 4gb RAM to a total of 8gb; purchased a Logitech Anywhere mouse (my desk is glass top); an extended warranty to 2 years and a Logitech Sound Bar. What I now own is a super 'puter of reliable, unfaltering speed, great sound and wonderful mousing technique all for well under $400. I am about to buy a 2nd for my significant other and will probably dress hers similarly. I still rely on my PC for rendering digital images ( I am a semi-retired Prof.Photog) as I need an absolute color monitor. But this Acer Aspire aspires to be a little sister. While the bloody thing is spot on with image reproduction, it will remain as an internet surfer,news relater, media projector and shopping tool. I love it and cannot praise it high enough. Who knew Acer was producing such quality electronics. Wish they made cameras if this is indicative of their grasp of the tech world.Nikon and Cannon take note! Do not hesitate to buy this if you are looking to save money and still have a decent portable computer.::E. Pollock "Woodman"::5.0::February 22, 2012

He could buy a usb wireless card for $30 and be in business.This laptop is zippy, and has easy options for anyone who wants a decent laptop for a great price.  Either comes with a Dual Core or Intel core 2 Duo processor, between 1 - 4 GB of MEMORY, an 80 or 160GB sata 7200 rpm hard drive, Blue tooth, decent graphics card, etc.  The Core 2 Duo will run Windows 7 64 bit without issue!There is a good reason why these things are still around!

R1FX53YEU9UD5T::Simply Mahvelous::Yep - a positive review on a refurbished computer.  Simply Mahvelous!I waited a time before writing this review.  I bought this laptop for traveling - AND because - at $200.00 - it was so Cheap!  Whenever we get a REALLY good deal in the human society, there is serious cause for pessism.  If you buy from a bear or a frog - no problem.  Just take it home and use it.  No need to ask any questions.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a few dishonest dollars.  But humanity is a different animal - and of course - I thought the thing would have spat up something disgusting - and died by now.I used it for a time on my treadmill, etc, and, as it was still with us- eventually set it up for my wife - who loves the blazing speed of the thing.  Just have a look at those specs.  This computer isn't a dog, and it isn't GrandMa's computer system either.  With Win 7 installed, and more horse power than you can shake a stick at - this computer REALLY performs.There are no anomalous behaviors with the thing either.  Unexplained shutdowns, weird crashes, blank screens, dead peripherals (however temporary) NONE of that.  Just solid computing power you can sit your website and critical applications on top of - and DEPEND on it when the chips are down.It came well packaged and well protected from damage.  So why only four stars?  The unit shipped with an old battery that won't stay charged for the expected time.  In a day or two, it will discharge - even if not under use.  That may not seem like a big deal - and it isn't (I guess) - but it makes me wonder if a company realizes that it shoots itself in the foot when doing something like this.  Had they installed a decent battery, I could have recommended the thing whole-heartedly.  AS things are, however - I have to raise the spector of Caveat Emptor.Anyway - want a good computer for $200 or even LESS?  Consider a refurbished HP Laptop like this one.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.::MasonB::4.0::April 20, 2013

R3JS7URP9SAJBO::Great find::If you have found this in Amazon you are luckier than I was. It wasn't listed under Laptops in Amazon and I've never seen an ad so I initially bought an HP ProBook 4525S. That has a screen that was DOA. No problem with the refund but we decided to go with a different manufacturer.I knew of Fujitsu as the maker of high quality scanners and saw this laptop reviewed with a slightly different configuration in an Asian computer magazine. I was very surprised that a search showed Amazon as a seller, much less the lowest priced seller.Based on Fujitsu's overall reputation and the written specs I took the plunge. So far I am very pleased. The build is very impressive for the money, much better than the laptop I returned. If the specs and price suit you I strongly recommend it.

Windows 8 didn't help usability, but that's not the issue. Less than 1 year later, the screen went out and needed replacement, and now the hard drive is not recognized no matter what I do.  Tried everything, even replacing, still not recognized. Drive works fine in other computers and via USB, so there's some kind of issue with the controller, hardware or BIOS, but the diagnostics don't report anything wrong even though only the DVD drive is recognized.  Refuses even to recognize it as a USB hard drive.  Contacted Fujitsu over a month ago explaining the issue.  Only response I got was that they received my request and it is being "processed."  Never again.::P. Davenport::1.0::October 12, 2013
RLMIGXG7KVWIE::So far so good!::Bought this laptop from a bigbox store recently for $549 plus tax. Great deal. So far it's worth every penny. The Core i3 processor with 6 gigs of RAM makes it sufficiently fast. I bought it to replace my 4 year old Toshiba and have been delighted to know that it still has many of the features that I like and has improved or upgraded other features. Although heavier than most computers in it's class it is lighter than my previous Satellite of the same size. The screen is now a little longer and narrower than before. Colors I think are a little brighter. It has 640 gigs of hard drive but I can't imagine that I will ever use more than 100 gigs of that. The built in speakers were a selling point for me. They are very loud and clear, unlike many of it's competitors whose speakers sound like they were taken out of one of those stuffed animals that talk when you squeeze them. You can lock the touch pad when you are typing. The volume control is now a touch sensor instead of a little wheel. The only downsides that I can think of are the weight and the mouse buttons which are a little stiff. The frame of the lap top has a weird textured look and feel. I guess the idea was so that fingerprints don't show but its grainy, textured feel is a little distracting at first. I'm sure I will get used to it soon. This new model also has a key pad, HDMI, and USB 3.0 although I'm still trying to figure out which one it is as it is not labeled.::oneleg::5.0::October 22, 2011
R3G1X4C7MH5VVD::Great laptop, great price.::The P755-S5215 is the second Toshiba Satellite that I've owned and I've had it for 7 months now without issue, as I expected. The first one (a U205-S5057 bought in mid 2007) still works perfectly except for 5 bad pixels on the monitor. Both of these laptops take regular trips in the tail bag of my motorcycle with all the vibration and lack of climate control that goes with it. The good... It has volume and a few media controls near the monitor. Why are manufacturers making laptops without volume and media controls? This was one of the few, including many of the more expensive units, with at least some controls! Seems cheap and lazy to me. The Harmon/Kardon speakers were some of the best in its price range. Even cranked up, voices are easily understood. Its headphone output makes good use of my Sennheiser PX200's and has enough power to make full volume uncomfortable. The monitor has good color and contrast and is a pleasure to watch movies on. Battery life is decent and even with the wi-fi on I had no problem watching the 162 min 'Watchmen' with headphones and brightness turned up. Mine seems to average about 3 to 3.5 hours and charges in around 30 to 45min. The unit is well balanced and even with the monitor tilted fully it won't flop over on its back. The keyboard has a great feel and seems solid and durable. The 'F' keys, arrow and number keys are separated enough to make them easy to find by feel in the dark. The case texture looks slick but is easy to hold onto even one handed and, for those concerned, doesn't show fingerprints too badly. The unit runs cool (unless you block the bottom vents!) and the fan is very quiet. The power cord is nice and long and easily reaches inconveniently placed motel outlets. The bad... To me, the only bad I can think of are really just annoyances. The mousepad buttons make a positive, but loud in quiet environments, 'click'. The pad itself is about an inch or so left of center and in the dark I find myself scrolling instead of moving the pointer. Speaking of dark, I like to turn down the brightness to surf and read in bed at night. Annoyingly, there is a lighted 'Satellite' logo on the bottom left corner that can't be turned off. It's now covered with a piece of tape. The monitor hinge closes positively but takes a firm two hands to open. The only thing I can't comment on is Windows 7. The Vista installed on the U205-S5057 left a very bad taste in my mouth and after suffering for 2 months I switched to Linux Ubuntu. When I bought the P755-S5215, I used Windows just long enough to burn a system restore disc (in case I ever need to return the laptop) then immediately installed Ubuntu. I can say that Ubuntu runs perfectly except for the 'loss' of the 2 finger mousepad which Ubuntu doesn't support...yet. I say 'loss' because after playing with a friend's laptop so equipped, it didn't add to my experience enough for me to miss it.I'll update this post If any issues come up.::Joneez::5.0::January 2, 2012

R1BORZY5H1XQGC::A second look - update of buyer beware::I purchased this model in September 2011 from a big box store.Pros: It is pretty  The sound is excellent  The i5 processor is okay  Battery life okay - about 3-4 hours  Nice sizeCons: Extremely sensitive touchpad that needs to be disabled in order to input text more than 2 words  From the beginning, I've had issues with the keyboard, especially Left  shift key to get upper case text; this has deteriorated and finally in early May, the keyboard just plain died. Since May 10th I've been trying to get it repaired -with 1.5 years left on my warranty.  Sadly, I've discovered that Toshiba's customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. I had to pay $25.00 and wait for a shipping carton to send the laptop to the Kentucky service center. Even though I still had the orginal packaging and could have used that to return it, it would have been worth it, but....I sent them "my" laptop with access to my software and files (backed up, thankfully) and a dead keyboard.2 weeks after my original contact, I received back the same chassis with cleared hard drive filled with factory-loaded software and a dead keyboard.Before I turned it on, I read the paperwork which said there was no problem with the hardware, that there was a software corruption. It did not say what software. When I called to question this,  I was told that the problem was with MS Windows7 HP and they had done a clean install. (ie so I didn't need to worry about any of my personal software.)So, I hung up and plugged it in and turned it on. The Windows screens came up for me to enter my name and laptop's name. But since keyboard still didn't work, I was unable to even put in my first name.It took me 4 phone calls to obtain email paperwork to return my 305 for another visit to Kentucky. Since it is a holiday weekend, the soonest I will be able to have it go to UPS will be Tuesday, May 29th... Fortunately, I have a netbook (a Toshiba BN205 that has been great - and the reason I shopped Toshiba for the Satellite) so I am not totally wiped out of the cyberworld but I really need the larger format for work.I am so disappointed; this isn't the Toshiba from years past. I paid almost $900 for this laptop on sale. In my online research this past week, I found that other buyers have had keyboard, touch pad, and especially shift key issues over time.8/6/12 update: In fairness to Toshiba, I felt like I should update my review:Almost 6 weeks after I originally sent my laptop in, I finally received it back from Toshiba repair service. The motherboard and keyboard were replaced and the laptop is now working perfectly. While I was waiting, because the netbook was not adequate to handle my workload for so long a time, I ended up buying a Lenovo 570 and have been extremely happy with that. So the Toshiba is now available for sale.....Hopefully the buyer will have no further problems, because I would not wish dealing with the Toshiba customer services on anyone.::Old Georgia Geek::3.0::May 27, 2012

R2O5QYN4XOYW1C::Disaster laptop - do not buy::I bought this laptop in December 2012 and took it on an overseas trip. It regularly and predictably crashed with the blue screen of death after about 30 minutes. With reboot I got 30 more minutes of work done. When I came back I wasted hours with HP tech support. Finally I sent it in for repair. It came back with a new disk, motherboard, battery and a new video card with no drivers. After installing the drivers the video card works. But now the screen "flickers" and allows keyboard input only randomly. Windows update does not work. I sent it back for repairs yesterday. Will keep you posted on this saga.::Nanobux::1.0::April 12, 2013
R2NYI3T2MD63I4::Heat-Faulting From Day 1, Expired 1 Week Out of Warranty::I bought this computer in March 2012. It baked itself into non-boot-ability by March 2013, 10 days out of warranty.HP reps laughed at me and suggested I solder the computer back together.Look it up, HP has lost AT LEAST THREE LAWSUITS for premature failure due to video card heat. They have not changed their ways. HP reps thought it was funny that the public doesn't know this yet.If you buy a decent video card, your HP laptop WILL CRASH IN 20 MINUTES of video, with loss of data, singeing and property damage to the tabletop.Mine sat on a 1" thick oak table, which it cracked twice due to extreme heat cycling. Plastic on the bottom softened into the singed cracks.Buying a $60 cooling tray extends video runtime before data-loss and crash to almost 30 minutes, but God help you if you take it off the cradle, or put it on your lap. 150 degrees F, second-degree burns, furniture damage, battery explosion risk, all due to completely unmanaged heat.Educate yourself about this company's lawsuit history and -80% recent stock price trajectory before buying anything HP! Used to be a great institution, but has been looted.::Toyotoomany::1.0::March 25, 2013

R2LLIU8IKLIHPA::Comparison to the 2011 Macbook Pro 13"::*2012 Pro and Air models are available but the designs remain the same meaning the physical aspects covered below are the same as well.The primary features of the 2012 13" MacBook Air are:- Ivy Bridge processor + HD 4000 graphics (60% better performance)- USB 3.0- 720p webcam- 2x SSD read speeds. Write speeds didn't change.- $100 price dropI've owned the machine for 10 months now and have simplified the review for your convenience.Things I like:+ Light weight; 2.9 lbs (1.3 kg). You can easily hold it with one hand - the MBP 13" is noticeably heavier at 4.5 lbs.+ Solid build quality like the MBPs. Chassis is rock solid, no keyboard flex, screen housing is rigid with minor flex in the middle.+ Better ergonomics than the MBPs; the palm rest edges don't dig into your wrists like the edges on the MBPs do.+ Same fluid multitouch trackpad and the backlit keyboard makes a return.+ The screen is a pleasure to use with it's high resolution (1440 x 900) and semi-gloss finish.There is no glass cover so there will be dramatically less reflections compared to the screen of the MBPsI personally chose the Air over the Pro because of reduced glare.+ 18 second boot ups and 3 second shut downs. Resumes from sleep within 3 seconds.+ The two USB 2.0 ports are on opposite sides of the laptop (less clutter than MBP)+ Speakers are surprisingly loud; they can fill up a small room.+ Runs extremely cool and it's so quiet that you'll wonder if the fan is running at all.I can definitely feel heat ~ 87 degrees F on the MPB 13's underside after 6 hours of usewhere as the MBA 13's underside stayed relatively cooler.+ Runs Windows 7 just as cool and quietly. (I installed Windows 7 via flash drive)+ Performance is almost identical to the MBP 13" 2011 on everyday tasks because the Core i5CPU can turbo boost to 2.7 GHz and the SSD allows for instant application launching.+ Gaming: it has the same Intel HD Graphics 3000 as the MBP 13" 2011. I was able to runStarcraft II smoothly at low settings on native resolution. Medium settings also ran nicely butyou get less FPS during large battles. League of Legends ran smoothly at medium settings30 FPS flat) on native resolution._______________________________________________________________________________________________________Things I don't like:- *IMPORTANT* Wifi drops - have been less frequent in the wake of more updates from Apple.- The keyboard is shallower and has less travel than the MBP keyboards (you'll get used to itwithin a few days)- The screen has less color gamut than the MBP 13's screen. This screen covers only 46% ofsRGB color spectrum where as the MBP 13's screen covers 77%. For image editing,I would use an external monitor.- The vertical viewing angles aren't so great. One minute tilt of the screen causes colors to shiftdramatically (for example: a purple color can change from lavender to light blue as you tiltthe screen backward or forward). Again, I would use an external monitor for tasks inwhich accurate colors are mission critical. For everyday use it's not noticeable and isactually easier on the eyes than the glare-prone screens of the MBPs.- Not all models come with the same SSD. There are 2 variations; a Samsung SSD and aToshiba SSD. The Samsung SSD significantly outperforms the Toshiba SSD inbenchmarks (check the AnandTech review)To check what SSD you have, click on the Apple logo -> About this Mac ->more info/system report -> then look on the left hand side and click on "Serial- ATA".If your SSD's serial number starts with "SM" it's a Samsung and a "TS" means it's aToshiba.- I personally get 5 hours of battery life max on a single charge while surfing with 10+ tabs open on safari; I got~7 hours doing the same tasks on the MPB 13 2011. My activities included watchingYouTube videos, viewing flash content on tech and news sites, reading/writing email,and using AIM.- No FaceTime HD Camera (720p) as on the MPBs. The quality difference is, unfortunately,very noticeable.- The integrated microphone is located on the side of the laptop instead of on top of the keyboardas on the MBP. During Skype calls, my buddies told me that my voice sounded muffledwhen using the Air. Using a headset with a mic, I was able to improve the sound quality.- The base of the machine developed a creaking noise within the first week of use. I suspect this to becaused by uneven tension in the screws.- after 5 months of, a white cluster of stuck pixels developed in the bottom left corner of the screen.The machine has been handled with care so it's not accidental damage._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Conclusion: Which one should you get?As a college student, I would recommend the Macbook Pro 13". The Air is more than capable of being a primary machine becauseof it's superb performance and overall very good screen. For everyday tasks, it should be snappy and an ease to use.However, students will get a $100 discount on the Pro while the Air only provides a $50 discount. This means that there is a pricedifference of $150 for students. The storage space on the Air is imited to 128GB or 256GB while the Pro comes standard with 500GB.Plus, you can always add a SSD to the Pro later on. The Pro will be the better choice for creative students because it's screen has more colorgamut than the Air's. Lastly, you are getting a full voltage processor which can make a differencein video encoding or other CPU intensive tasks.If you are not a student:If you value the extra ports (Ethernet, Firewire, optical drive), a high gamut screen (although more reflective), a 720p webcam(it's a lot better), and the ability to upgradelater down the line - go for the Pro.If you prioritize portability (light weight), higher screen resolution, fast boot ups/shut downs, and less reflections - go for the Air.In everyday performance the Air feels faster when booting up and launching applications because of its SSD. In CPU intensive tasks,the Pro will have a slight edge but not much. (the two CPUs are actually pretty neck to neck on GeekBench benchmarks). They bothhave the same graphics chip but note that the Pro will get better battery life (1-2 hours more) than the Air because the Pro has a biggercapacity battery (63.5 watt-hours vs. 50 watt-hours)Unfortunately, my unit is affected with a wifi drop problem. I don't know if you will encounter the same issue but if you buy an Air froman Apple Store, make sure to test the wifi out by using it on multiple networks. If you encounter any erratic wifi drops withinthe first 14 days - demand a refund or an exchange._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Update - December 27th, 2011After installing the 10.7.2 and a firmware update, the wifi connections in my dorm room became more reliable.However, after taking it home I experienced drops as before on the home network. I DOUBT it's a problem with myrouter because ALL other connected devices work fine. The 2011 MBP 13" I previously owned worked flawlessly on my network.This is most likely a problem with the Air's drivers. 5 months after product launch, I don't believe Applehas acknowledged the issue or either chose to IGNORE it as other users on the official forums continue tohave similar complaints even to this day.Hardware wise,  the casing held up well except for a scratch on the side. The lid is frighteningly thin and I've readreports of the screen's fragile nature - cracking at the slightest bump by another object. I would handle with care.Want to know something funny? With the machine off, I can see through the Apple logo on the lid if there's lightbehind it - it's that thin.Software wise, sometimes the machine would run hot with fans blazing full throttle when watching HD YouTube videosand would remain that way even though I close everything. Very odd. A quick reboot solves the problem.A creaking sound developed within a week of purchase. When I lift the machine up, press on the palm rest or type on itthere would be a creaking noise produced. I suspected the screws of the bottom to be loose so I decided to tighten them.Note that you'll have to order a pentalobe screwdriver to do this - the screws aren't the typical type._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________January 9th, 2011A cluster of 4-5 stuck pixels developed so I went to get a screen replacement. The Apple genius confirmed it was4-5 pixels which qualified me for a screen replacement. Service was prompt and I got the machine the next day.However, the new screen had 2 clearly visible dead pixels in the center of the screen. I tried using it for a few daysbut they were an absolute distraction.Dissatisfied, I took it back to another genius only to be met with rude service. I stated that the dead pixels hinderedfunctionality as they were visual distractions. He snidely responded with, "Where? I don't even see them" and remainedadamant about not replacing it because I didn't qualify for the "minimum of 5 dead pixels for a replacement" policy.It was an unpleasant experience to say the least and didn't help._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________March 11th, 2011I've learned to live with the two dead pixels on the screen and Apple has released an update (10.7.3) to address thewireless card. I've noticed that with Bluetooth off, the connections are pretty stable around campus and at home.I've not yet tested this with Bluetooth - it makes me curious because people on the official forums report wifi drops whenenabling Bluetooth. Anyway, After 7 months of ownership I would say most of the initial bugs have been remedied andthe Air is a pleasure to use. However, I speculate that the Pro and Air lineup will be updated to Ivy Bridge in the summer(along with the rumored redesign of the Pros). Buy now if you need it but if you can - waiting might be better.Cheers!::Wayne Ngo::4.0::July 29, 2011
R3MKO486GGK450::Great Looks, Speedy Laptop. Gets hot and loud under moderate CPU load.::I have been using my new 13" Macbook Air, 256GB, Core i7 for just over a week and here are my impressions...First, the good stuff...- The industrial design is absolutely gorgeous and rock-solid. The laptop is thin, light and pleasure to look at.- Screen is 13" but the resolution is comparable to that of most 15"+ laptops. Perfectly usable for graphic/software development. While Macbook Air uses (supposedly) an inferior TN panel compared to Macbook Pro, I did not find a drastic difference between the two (I also own a 17" Macbook Pro). The Air has slightly smaller viewing angles and perhaps not as good colour reproduction, but the differences are subtle. Also, there's a lot less glare on Air's "glossy" display compared to glossy Macbook Pro.- Performance is great, in some cases it bests the Quad Core i7 17" Macbook Pro, thanks to its SSD Drive. Startups/shutdowns are super fast and the applications open/close almost instantly. Having said that, do not expect to do any serious gaming on this little guy. The built-in Intel graphics chip has hard time handling even 5 year old games and is actually slower than nVidia chip on the previous generation Air.- Expect to get about 4-5 hours of mixed use out of "7 hour" battery. That's what I average while doing some Photoshop and web dev work, browsing, listening to music and viewing a few video clips.Now, the negatives...Well, it's one negative really, but it is something I find extremely annoying. The laptop gets VERY hot when CPU usage approaches 50% and the fan kicks in full-blast at 6,000+ RPM.I first noticed the excessive noise when I was transferring my data and applications from the time machine backup upon initial setup. The fan stayed on entire time, CPU temperature was approaching 90C while being only 30% utilized.I continued to experience high heat/fan noise issues throughout the week. Sometimes it was during routine web browsing where some of the websites contained Flash elements. Starting Windows XP in Parallels would immediately set the fan in motion, again, sometimes hitting 6,000+ rpm. Playing Civilization IV, a fairly old game, had fan going full blast entire time with CPU again reaching 90C. Apple's own "Cosmos" screensaver brings the CPU temperature up to 80-85C and the fan up to 4500-5000rpm. The most annoying thing -- none of these tasks were taxing the CPU at more than 50%!I did a fair bit of research on this issue. There are multiple discussions on Apple, MacRumours and other forums about excessive heat and fan noise. Also, many report increased heat on their older Apple laptops after upgrading to Lion, so perhaps (fingers crossed), there's a patch on the way that will improve thermal management somewhat.The thought about returning the Air for refund did cross my mind, but I decided to keep it in the end. I am not a gamer and doing my work (web/mobile development) is not very taxing on the CPU, however, I do not think it is unreasonable to expect relatively quiet operation on such premium laptop with only 50% CPU usage. I can only hope that Apple is listening and looking to remedy the problem.***Update: March 28, 2012***It has been several months since I purchased the Air, so I thought I'd write a quick update.There were no software updates from Apple that would fix the overheating issue. Some claim in the comments that the thermal problems are limited to Macbook Air Core i7 version, however, I got to play with friend's Core i5/120Gb Air and got the fan hitting 6,000+ rpm simply by opening two browser tabs with YouTube videos in them. The playback has become choppy pretty quickly as well. The fan was also audible on pages with a few Flash elements in it (like newspaper sites). It seemed slightly (very slightly) less prone to heat issue, but it's definitely there.I also played around with an 11" Macbook Air Core i5 at the Apple Store and, interestingly enough, it handled Flash far better than (supposedly) more powerful 13"... I opened 5! 1080p YouTube videos and still wouldn't hear the fan... Quite amazing actually. The difference seems to be the i5/i7 processors in the 13" Air that can hit higher clock speeds but nearly frying the internals in the process.If you find your Macbook Air fan going off like a jet engine every time you visit YouTube or any page with Flash content, here are a couple of browser plugins that I found helpful (they block movies until you specifically click on them):- FlashBlock for Firefox- ClickToFlash for SafariThere's a model refresh coming sometime this summer, apparently, and I hope Apple will figure out the way to solve this problem. Of course, much depends on Intel chips that they're going to use in new models.::Alex Green "alx779"::3.0::August 15, 2011
RE4KOXG8PX8RG::The best ultraportable laptop produced thus far...::Background:For the past two years or so I've gone through numerous brands/models in an incessant search to find a laptop that was easily portable and had enough horsepower to match or exceed the performance of a solid $500 desktop with enough battery life to last over four hours of real world use. In this time span I've gone through over a dozen laptops or netbooks that were eventually returned, sold, donated to family or friends, modded and repurposed, or are currently sitting collecting dust awaiting a similar fate. A short list of the more memorable laptops/netbooks that I've previously owned/used that I can remember off hand include: HP TM2T(Core 2 Duo); HP TM2T(Core i3), Asus T101MT, MacBook Air (2009), Acer 4820TG, HP Envy 14, HP dv7t Quad Edition, ASUS U36JC, MacBook Pro 13, and two lower cost laptop models made by Gateway and Acer that I won't mention because they really didn't fit the criteria I was looking for when I acquired them.I can truly say the 2011 MacBook Air 13" is the most satisfied I've been with any laptop I've used. Although I do find some quirks with the 2011 MBA lineup they are passable and this product still deserves a full five stars. I will probably echo some of the same pros and cons that others have stated, but let's move on with my review so I can tell you my impressions of this.HARDWARE PROS:- Weight/Form Factor: I've always considered portability to be important in a laptop but I can't emphasize this enough. If you've never held and used a MacBook Air before you should be impressed by its weight and form factor alone. Mostly anyone could easily hold the 13" MacBook with one hand. It means I can be watching a video and if I need to move to another room in the house and can easily walk with the laptop in one hand. However, I don't think it is light/comfortable enough to hold while standing for prolonged periods of time. I've demonstrated how light it is to several people under 5 feet tall by stand and watch a YouTube video holding the MBA with one. So, if you're concerned about the 13" size because you're short you shouldn't let that deter you until you actually try it.- Core i5 2nd Generation Sandy Bridge Processor/ 4GB RAM Standard: When I first got the 2009 MBA I was extremely impressed by its form factor and weight as stated above, but after trying to use the 2009 MBA for productivity and multitasking you realize that something is amiss in the hardware and this eventually leads to frustration. The 2009 and 2010 MacBook Air base models only included 2GB of RAM and missed an entire generation of Core i-series processors, and despite having a solid state hard drive and a dedicated graphics card their of value in price to performance was very underwhelming compared to what was available for much less at the time. I currently have 16 tabs opened across four windows in Firefox, 5 tabs in Chrome, two applications(Silverlight and Java) streaming live financial quotes, DropBox, iTunes and a P2P application running while I am typing this review. I haven't noticed any noticeable hitches in performance. I have read about others complaining about issues with various Adobe software (especially Flash) with the latest version of OS X Lion. I have only experienced some sluggishness once when resuming from deep sleep. For testing I used a downloaded Flash game. It took a little more than 10 seconds to re-render. However, this may have more to do with the integrated graphics and could possibly be corrected in the future with an update.- Solid State Drive: There's not much to say here. If you've never experienced the performance leap from using a SSD then you will probably be more than a little impressed by the much faster load/boot times. I've installed SSDs on a few computers after talking up the performance boosts. I guess they were expecting everything to be instantaneous. Anyway, it's very noticeable in Bootcamp running Windows over the MBP 13 I've been using or when transfering/copying larger files. You can read more about the much faster load/boot times from other reviews online.- Trackpad: Quite often, previous MacBook owners don't mention this as a Pro. However, the trackpad is the biggest reason why I prefer a MacBook as my laptop of choice. I grew tired of the jumping cursors, crappy drivers, and erratic touchpad gestures. For some reason Synaptic and most PC vendors overlook or can't seem to get it right. How do you neglect its importance as the primary functioning hardware you use to actually interact with your computer. The trackpad on the MBA just works. It works so well and is far more than accurate enough that I actually prefer not using a mouse with my laptop because of it.- Backlit Keyboard: The keyboard itself may take some getting used to if you've never used a MacBook before. However, once you grow accustomed to the layout you will enjoy the amount of travel and "clickiness" to it. Thankfully, the backlight was brought back for the 2011 lineup. I don't understand why this feature was removed to begin with since it doesn't impact battery life that much. It's clutch and greatly appreciated in low lit environments.- Build: It's the same aluminum casing material used in all the MacBook models and the same chassis design that was used in the 2010 model. Solid constructionHARDWARE CONS:- No USB 3.0: Although USB 3.0 is not as ubiquitous USB 2.0 it is quickly growing and peripherals are far more abundant and less expensive than Thunderbolt peripherals. USB 3.0 will likely remain far more popular than Thunderbolt after Apple's exclusivity expires next year because USB 3.0 is more cost-effective to produce and is backwards compatible with the millions of USB 2.0 devices already available. I agree with other reviewers in that this reduces the future proofing of this model, and it seems like Apple's Firewire vs USB 2.0 situation repeated. (I digress that at least there are two USB 2.0 ports on opposite ends. My original 2009 MBA had one.)- Facetime Camera not High Definition: I try not to show my mug on camera but sometimes I have to use it to speak to clients via remote connections and occasional video conferencing. Again, considering the profit margins on each MBA sold I don't understand the reason to exclude this feature other than Apple being Apple and including this as an improved feature for next year.- Power Button: The power button is placed in the keyboard layout right above the delete key!!! It's where the eject button is on my MBP right above the Delete key. Yes, I just praised the keyboard in the Pros. Until you grow accustomed to this your chances of accidentally hitting the power button by mistake in the beginning is likely. It won't shut your computer down or put the computer to sleep. It simply brings up the power down dialog, but it's still a questionable button placement.- Memory is not upgradeable: Not much more to add here. 4GB is enough for me and the SSD is definitely a huge boost to hard drive caching.- Need adapters for HDMI, VGA, DVI. At this price and considering the profit margins on each unit sold the adapters at least an adapter for HDMI or VGA should be included. Meh...OS X LION PROS: (because it deserves its own section)- Mission Control and Spaces: I really like it. I used spaces on Snow Leopard with full screen apple(via third party apps) and this makes using it that much easier. You can drag windows from Space to Space to re-arrange your groups. It's a great improvement that can be improved.- Cloud/App Store Operating System Installation: No 50 character CD Keys, scratched backup disks, or corrupt files on your thumb drive. Cheaper prices.- Automatic Resume: It seamlessly automatically saves the last state of your applications. Some users don't like that applies universally to every open app, but it's very simple to prevent from occurring. If you are done with an and want to prevent said app from automatically restoring simply right click its icon in the dock press option and select force quit. Another app I've used is Flexiglass which adds the functionality of right clicking the red X to completely close an app and all its windows.OSX LION CONS: (because it deserves its own section)- Launchpad: This was a poor, not well executed integration into OS X. Out the box the Launchpad replaces the App Folder in the dock that used to be next to documents and the trash bin. I actually stared at the screen for a few moments until I dug through the search results. I've tried to use it. It keeps the desktop icon less cluttered for me and I moved many of the icons I typically place there in the Launchpad. However, customizing the Launchpad has its quirks. For instance, adding and renaming folders/icons in the Launchpad isn't just easily done on the Launchpad by right clicking the icon. You have to open it in Finder to rename it. There are no options to change the gesture in System Preference to view the Launchpad. I truly feel like the default gesture was tested using the midgets or elementary school kids. My hands are too big to consistently do the gesture. You'd think I could palm two basketballs with one hand. Right now, the launchpad is quirky and somewhat redundant. I understand the direction Apple is heading and are thus slowly blending touch-based iOS and traditional Mac OS X, but the way Apps for OS X are distributed and the complete integration is definitely not with us today in any of Apple's lineup. Hopefully, things will improve with future updates. My hopes is that the launchpad serves as a replacement for Show Desktop in the future.- Natural Scrolling: By default scrolling is inverted. Some like it, some don't, most people will find it awkward at first and I'd bet the majority no matter how slim will change this back. I'd prefer an opt-in integration method for this if Apple wanted to change several decades of computing.- Three Finger Back/Forward and Scroll to Top/Bottom:  I don't know why this configuration was changed from 10.6 to 10.7 but out the box you may notice when you run a third party browser such as Firefox or Chrome that you are unable to page back/forward using the old gesture three finger swipe left/right. Well, you have to change "Swipe between pages" to "Scroll Left/Right with Two or Three Fingers" under Systems Preferences->Trackpad->More Gestures. A gesture that is now missing entirely is three swipe up/down to scroll to top/bottom but I found a solution with an app called BetterTouchTool By Andreas Hegenberg. It's a very good tool to customize the trackpad gestures to your liking.Expose: No minimized apps unless you are using another window of said minimized app. I don't understand the logic as to why this was removed. It was still featured to be working during the beta but has been removed. The last time I can remember having to click more than twice to view a minimized window was Windows 3.1. Again, I would prefer if this option was carried over from the Beta and preferred an opt-in integration method for this if Apple wanted to change a decade plus of computing.OSX LION NEURAL OR MEH: (because it deserves its own section)Many other changes in Lion were under the hood; complete migration to 64-bit and complete Trim support. A lot of the bundled apps have been improved particularly Mail, Lion Recovery, FileVault, AirDrop, Versions, overlay scroll bars. Some improvements are bigger/more noticeable than others. Also, you can now re-size windows from any corner/edge: Nothing innovative; better late than never; nice for those who are coming from Windows and haven't/won't use other third party accessibility apps.OTHER THOUGHTS:- Screen: I've seen others mention the difference in screen quality between the MacBook Air and Pro models. I have noticed a slight difference. Two things that immediately affect your PERCEPTION of the screen are the resolution and the fact that the area surrounding the display on the MBA is metallic gray vs glossy black on the MBP. When you're comparing the two you might not think that matters. The screen on the MBA does use TN panels but they are far better than your typical run of the mill 1024 x 768 that continues to flood the laptop industry that I typically see. Because of its screen resolution I can dock windows side by side easier on the 13" MBA than I could  with a 17" HP dv7 quad core edition that I used. No lie.- Battery Life: Don't believe the advertised 7 hours of battery life unless you're using a third party utility or disabling all wireless connections and dimming the screen down. However, I easily get about 5 hours surfing the web indoors. I've gotten a little under four hours streaming financial quotes and actively surfing indoors, but I'd typically have it plugged in if I need it for more intensive productivity tasks. Definitely not as good as the MacBook Pro 13".- No Restore Drive: I understand this was a concern for some. Apple released the free Lion Recovery Disk Assistant from Apple's support page. You can make your own recovery thumb drive on a low cost thumb drive of your choice or you can order an OS X Lion Thumb Drive for Apple's Mac App Store for $69 which was released today.- Graphics: Will it max Crysis? No... I have a desktop rig for that when I want. This is an ultraportable laptop and IMO it's the best available.OTHER TIPS:Screen Keeps Dimming and Brightening: At first, I thought it was because i was using the charger from my MBP and I was ruining a brand new expensive --- computer, but I was 98% certain that couldn't be the case. I went to Systems Preferences -> Energy Saver and unchecked Slightly dim the display when using this power source but that wasn't the case because it wasn't on battery. Anyway, I unchecked Automatically Adjust Screen Brightness under Display and felt as if 7 million brain cells must've died beforehand because it took a while to figure it out, but that solved it.Security: Please change your broadcasting discoverable wireless settings and enable your firewall under System Preferences. This is especially true if you are going to use this extremely portable laptop in public areas. Although, Macs aren't targeted nearly as much as Windows or the most popular Linux Distros you are not secure if leave the door wide open.I avoided the expensive adapters and bought two aftermarket adapters to suit my needs that have worked well thus far. Kensington USB Mini Dock with Ethernet for Mac/PC which provides 3 USB 2.0 ports and an ethernet port. You can find a HDMI adapter for very cheap. Though, they may only last several months you could order a dozen of them. Again, I strongly recommend BetterTouchTool if you are looking to gain back the same gestures from Snow Leopard.SO, THE QUESTION IS SHOULD YOU CONSIDER BUYING AND WHAT MODEL?Obviously, this depends on your needs and budget. I feel the MBA is the best ultraportable available and if you can go without a DVD drive an a few extra ports my recommendations are the high end 11" MacBook Air or the base model 13" MacBook Air as others have stated. The 4GB vs 2GB makes a difference. The deciding factor would be $100, portability, and how much screen real estate you feel you is adequate for you.I considered buying one of the best alternatives, the Samsung Series 9. The included warranty was enticing but I've had to deal with servicing a laptop through the mail four times and it's never pleasant. Resale value was another factor, and though it has one of the best touch pads I've used on Windows until Synaptics releases their next generation touch pads and trackpads it still felt subpar. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to get back into cross-platform development for OS X. However, another decent alternative to consider is the Toshiba Portege R835 if you are looking for an ultraportable with very strong battery life.I want to raise a point not many people write about in their reviews and that is SSD performance over time. Although, OS X Lion includes TRIM support the performance of all solid state drives degrades as you store more data to the drive. I've experienced this with a couple of desktop builds I've done. With some SSD's the performance degradation begins after filling up just half the disk drive, and affects nearly all drives to some extent once the drive is 70% full. This is something to consider when storing data. An external storage solution of some kind is strongly recommended.Currently, there are two different solid state drives that ship with the MacBook Airs. One is made by Samsung and is the higher performing drive and the other is made by Toshiba. You can check which version you have by going to About this Mac->System Report->More Info click Serial-ATA and check the the first two letters of the model after APPLE SSD.  Credit goes to Amazon user Wayne N for pointing this out in his review. I haven't read any benchmarks on the performance over time with the new MBA.I personally purchased the 256GB model because I need to store financial data and I need a large Bootcamp partition for Windows to compose and sample music, coding that involves very large libraries and enough storage for music and the occasional movie if I'm not on my home network. So, everyone's needs are different. Still, SSD size and degradation is something to consider for your intended use. The MBA is not a true desktop replacement especially if you're into playing games (of any kind if you want decent graphics) but I feel that the MBA can serve as a your primary computer depending on your needs.Thanks for reading this lengthy review. Hope it helps in your decision.::R. Chapman::5.0::August 16, 2011

 Length:: 7:19 Mins::iGlaswegian "Z.S"::5.0::August 12, 2011
R11HIY6RKIZUBF::Good laptop, but overhyped::I've been using a Macbook Air for a week now.  I have the 2011 13" ultimate: i7 1.8GHz, 4GB RAM, and 256SSD.  My main uses are Office for Mac 2011, Skype, internet video, ArcGIS/Windows 7, Mathmatica, Matlab, C/C++, objective-C, and Java. At the moment I mainly use the Air for writing documents.  I am trying to live with the Air as my primary machine and I plan to connect it to a thunderbolt monitor for additional screen real estate.Pros:The Air looks beautiful and Lion is an absolute pleasure to use.  The SSD makes it all work together.  The screen is gorgeous to look at under the right lighting conditions and the resolution is fantastic. The keyboard is generally good. The track pad is awesome and the diagonal cut of the case is much easier for writing on than my previous unibody macbook.Cons:* Build quality. The renowned Apple quality seems to be lacking in my unit. The space bar does not always respond and requires two press from time to time.  The F5 key needs to be hit multiple times in order to work. The case does not seem to fit properly in the lower right corner of the unit and flexes. The screen gets darker edges near the silver bezel.* Skype and facetime.  I find that the placement of the mic on the side of the unit is a disaster for these applications.  I am constantly responding to complaints about poor voice quality that only improves if I turn the machine on its side and speak directly into the mic.  Depending on your use this may not be a big problem, but it is for me.* The screen can be irritatingly reflective under fluorescent lighting, but I can usually adjust my position to compensate.  However, I usually need to use a low screen illumination to get reasonable battery life, which compounds any glare problems.  This is not a major issue unless you are sensitive to glare.* The battery life on my unit is not great.  The first two days I was impressed with 7+ hours.  A week later and I'm lucky to get 4 hours.  Disappointingly the unit does not always seem to hold a full charge.  I'm not even sure I could watch a full-length movie without mains power. Part of the problem is flash, but watching any video drains the battery at an alarming rate.  The battery monitor also does not seem to provide a reasonable estimate of remaining time.* When watching video I have noticeable screen stutter.  This could be a result of the streaming service I use, but I'm not sure.  It is not so bad that I would return the unit for it, but it is there and if you value smooth video then be sure to check it out carefully before you buy.* The Air gets blisteringly hot near the charger connection when running heavy applications. The fan comes on and battery life evaporates.  Some complain the fan is noisy, but my main problem is the impact on battery life.* The ram can only be maxed out at 4GB.  This is really annoying when you need to dual boot and is compounded by the graphics chip using main memory.* There are also two SSDs (Samsung and Toshiba) that the machine ships with. I ended up with the slower Toshiba drive.  I do get the beach ball from time to time, but I could not say that this is related to my unit shipping with the slower Toshiba drive.  Generally things are snappy.  However, instant on is not always instant. I don't know if this is related to the slower Toshiba drive or just the applications I have open.All in all this is a good machine, but not outstanding. I would say the Macbook Air has been seriously overhyped.  It has some strong points.  I enjoy using it and the portability and weight are outstanding.  However, I am genuinely frustrated by the mic placement and poor build quality.  There are solutions, but when you spend $1700 plus tax on a machine I think you have the right to expect it to work. The Toshiba drive is annoying, but may not be significant and the battery life is a worry.  I'm not sure how the machine will standup to the day-to-day grind.This unit is going back to the store and Apple deserves full credit for its return/refund policies.  The 14 day, no restocking fee, window offered to return or exchange a unit is outstanding.**** Update September 30:Apple's customer service is fantastic. Apple provided a new unit which seems to have fewer build quality problems: all the keys work, the unit shipped with the Samsung SSD, and the microphone is much better.  However, I still have problems with the microphone position and sensitivity and while battery life is better on this unit it is still not great for watching video.  Instant on is still not instant on, but I can support other reviewers who have not noticed any performance difference between the Samsung and Toshiba SSDs, although I'm glad I have the samsung drive. All-in-all my new Air deserves at least another 1/2 star, may be even a whole star because of Apple's customer service.::Nick::3.0::September 12, 2011

The competition (read Non-Mac and My choices of Laptops)-------------------------------------------------------------1) Not really much into Dell, Toshiba, HP, Lenovo>> Had a Thinkpad before last year and that went just shy of over a year>> The Dell XPS Laptop in my interest was too bulky and looked horrible. Size of screen; 15" for the desired 1920 resolution.>> The HP Laptop (dv6t - Quad/Select) edition laptop was good on Technical Specs, but again, build was too bulky and Plasticky. Size of screen; 15" for the desired 1920 resolution2) The Samsung Series 9 Laptop>> When configuring the Samsung Series 9 to have 1.8Ghz Core i7, 8 GB RAM 256 GB SSD, it was coming upto $2100 all incl(give or take another $100); This was too expensive for me..even though the laptop looked good. Besides, i wanted to use MacOS also occassionally as i liked the Interface.3) All the laptops here were about 6 lbs atleast...excluding the Samsung series 9.-------------------------------------------------------------D. Why i bought the Air-------------------------------------------------------------1) ** MacOS2) ** 256 GB SSD was perfect storage vs Speed Size for me.>> I did not need the slower and extra space in the 700 GB 7200 rpm.>> Besides, i wanted to take a laptop and buy an SSD later. I did not want to pay premium for 700 GB drive.3) ** Battery Life (Minimum 5 hrs met my requirement)>> My earlier 2010 Macbook Air core2Duo used to last me >6 hrs between charges4) ** Processor Speed>> I wanted an i7 processor and the updated Macbook Air specs allowed for it.5) ** Screen/Resolution:>> Higher resolution on the 13" Macbook Air which i believe was greater than the 15" regular MBP definitely looked good>> A visit to the apple store showed how excellent the screen is>> A Bootcamp installation of Win 7 and the screen really compares with the 15" 1920x resolution models>> The screen on the macbook air 13" is phenomenal!...and very easy on the eyes.6) ** RAM:>> While it was tempting to opt for the HP dv6t, which could take upto 16GB RAM, i decided that 4 GB should be enough for my usage in the Macbook Air.7) USB 2.0:>> Would have liked USB 3.0, but decided i would wait the additional time out during data transfers.8) Minidisplay Port to HDMI:>> I used to connect my older 2010 Macbook Air to my HDTV with Video/Audio out. No issues. This was definitely not an issue here.9) Dual Booting into Windows 7 using Bootcamp:>> I actually tried this out last night and it was quite painless.>> Currently typing this review from Win7 on my 13" Macbook Air.>> Split my 256 GB SSD drive into 85 GB for MacOS and 150 GB for Win7.>> The Windows 7 partition stores my work outlook and regular windows files.To summate my reasoning:Though the Processor in the Macbook Air was not the full quad core i7, my reasoning was the SSD should more than make up for routine tasks.>> For the additional, occassional, slightly heavier processing like editing RAW DSLR images,i hope that the i7 processor i selected as upgrade should more than provide the additional punch.>> Yes. There is a drawback of slightly higher Fan Noise...but this is temporary.>> There was nothing in the market to beat the Value/Lightweight offering of the Macbook Air, when you factor in the SSD.>> The resolution and Screen and battery were all fabulous!-------------------------------------------------------------E. Buying the Macbook Air-------------------------------------------------------------Finally Bought the 13" Macbook Air 1.8Ghz Core i7, 256 GB SSD, 4 GB RAM>> Total cost with Sales Tax: $1739.00-------------------------------------------------------------F. Usage/Experience with MacOS------------------------------------------------------------->> MacOS Lion is quite nice actually.>> The interface and the Macbook Air screen really pop out for a 13" screen.>> The OS does not feel heavy/bog down on the available resources>> So far, i have just done general browsing and causal fiddling with the specs.** Will update once i work more.To summate: Love the MacOS Experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!------------------------------------------------------------------G.

R3QJMJOUVHYKVV::APPEAL: Yes.  VALUE: Yes.  Apple understands.::Those that saw my previous review of the 2010 11" MacBook Air will fully understand that title.  The 2010 MacBook Air suffered from a lack of true value, attempting instead to do the absolute minimum in an attempt to appeal to people's aesthetic tastes while sacrificing key features and not pushing the envelope.  Well, with the 2011 version, they have gone back to the drawing board.  Indeed, they have released what the MacBook Air should have been all along.  You can read the specs above for details about what is all here. I'm only focusing on what's improved over the last gen.After re-reading my review, I decided to reorganize things for fluidity.  So I'm going to first start with the general hardware and its approach.  First, let's talk about what's good.- Base 13" is a great deal if you don't need storage on the device.  The price is set just right, and there are very few compromises here.  You can go to the higher storage for $300 if you want, but honestly, just buy an external for $100.  My opinion.- Apple has returned the backlight keyboard.  There was huge consumer demand for this feature, and removing it was pointless.  The machine is so much better with it back, and did great on the night flight back to San Diego.- Mail is no longer a battery killer.  In the older version of the MacBook Air, running the Mail app used to destroy the battery something fierce.  Battery life is a little lower, but realistically it's good enough for the majority of uses.  If you're a heavy user don't expect to get more than 4 hours out of it.- Backlight keyboard alone does not seem to have very much impact on the battery.  This was a worry for some, it really does not make that much of a difference on the battery at all, to my pleasant surprise.- More, faster RAM included this time around.  This is important for application multitasking.  I don't like that it's soldered on again, but I give them a pass due to the 4GB being standard on the base 13" unlike last year's debacle.So why'd I knock it down a star?Well...in all fairness, there's absolutely no logical reason that Apple should have ignored USB 3.0 by now.  Even accounting for the addition of the Thunderbolt port, the reality is that USB 3.0 being backwards compatible with 2.0 makes it the best future proofing choice for computers, and one that all competitors have made.  Apple refusing to jump on board is going to hurt their chances of pushing units.  They'll sell a lot of machines as always, but there will come a breaking point.  Even if they wanted to push Thunderbolt harder, it would not have harmed them financially or competitively to include at least one USB 3.0 port.Also, I wasn't really impressed with the quality of the screen.  There's just something...off...about the screen.  It's hard to put into words.  But it just doesn't have that same visual presence as the Pro, or even the 2010 Air.  My understanding is that the panel type has been changed, likely causing this phenomenon.  There's pixelation in places, and the text doesn't have the same clarity as with the Pro line.  There were some compromises here.  For day-to-day usage it's not a deal breaker, but it's noticeable and thus I note it here.  Don't expect "magical" screen quality.  If the screen quality all around matters and you have a keen eye like me, go for a Pro.Battery life is also quite finicky.  I know it's rated at "up to 7 hours" but I want to stress that this is under EXTREMELY conservative use cases.  I'm talking Safari only, no flash, low backlight keyboard, low screen brightness.  On the plane when they dimmed the cabin lights, I was able to go to one notch on the screen and backlight, which let me see perfectly, and then it lasted quite well.  But here at home, with the screen brightness at just over halfway, running Mail, Firefox and Safari (because right now Safari is the default browser for Mail links), I'm hovering around 5 hours, which isn't bad.  Yet if Spotlight gets fired up and indexing, I watched in horror as that figure went down to 2 hours under the same conditions.Lastly, I am compelled to knock them for their refusal to at least include a USB restore drive in the box.  I know they're pushing downloads and streaming media, but the reality is that physical media for computer restoration is almost a necessity.  The novelty of an internet-based reinstall is nice, and they can keep that, but I still say that they should have included the Lion OS on a USB drive like they did with the 2010.  The additional cost is pennies for that drive, so cost isn't the reason.  They're pushing an agenda, and I don't like being tethered to the internet if and when I need to reinstall my operating system.  There is a hidden recovery partition for this purpose that you can also use.  But I think Apple is missing the boat here.  What if the drive itself, the physical drive, goes toast?  You're stuck unless you pay money.  Thus the value of having external media for restoration if and when that were to happen.  The SSD bar in the Air is replaceable, and there are already options from OWC for those users.  But it's useless unless you pay $30 to download Lion and burn it/write it yourself or pay Apple $70 for a USB stick with Lion on it.  To me both are unacceptable alternatives for something that should be in the box of every computer.-_- Mac OS X 10.7, CODE NAME LION -_-I want to interject here and state for the record that the majority of what bothers me with this purchase really has more to do with Lion, the newest operating system from the Apple, rather than the Air hardware itself.  Based on my experience, the Lion OS is a step in the wrong direction.  Apple is attempting to blend what we know of Mac OS with what certain users know of iOS, and the output is a very clunky experience at times.  They introduced plenty of new features, and changed some tried and true features at the same time.  It's clear they are attempting to create a single OS for both tablets and the desktop OS, but it's just...wrong.Apple introduced a new feature, Mission Control, which is designed to act as the evolution of Exposé and Spaces. The problem is that Mission Control is finicky.  It wants each app to be run in Full Screen to be able to separate them correctly within a single desktop.  However...running apps full screen is a bit of a pain because it disables the Dock.  Thus if you're running Firefox, let's say, in full screen you can't then see the unread count on Mail in the Dock.  This basically forces you to run a Desktop that is just a Desktop and then run other apps in their own Desktop space. If you don't run apps in full screen, Mission Control then just "Paper stacks" them in a very unorganized fashion within the same Desktop.  If an app is minimized into the Dock, it does not show in Mission Control.  This seems bass-ackwards...if it is minimized into the Dock it should be one of the icons on top in Mission Control automatically.  The only way to force this is to manually create the Desktop and assign the app to it, or full screen the app and then switch out of it.I know that's hard to understand, but the bottom line is that the approach isn't very well implemented.Apple has introduced another feature, Launchpad, which is essentially an iPad view of all of the local applications.  It supports the grouping concept also found on iOS.  Anyone who owns an iPod Touch or an iPad/iPhone will instantly recognize this.  The idea is obvious; the concept of it just does not work on a full computer.  It translates on a simple touch interface, but not a computer where you're not really touching.  It should be obvious that the intent is to have one operating system for both desktops and tablets in an attempt to extend iOS beyond its limitations and dumb down the desktop experience.  I get it.  But beyond the obvious issues, there are more functional problems.  Launchpad shows queued up downloads or updates to existing apps rather than the app itself.  So for example, I saw there was an upgrade for iPhoto and started it from the App Store when I was on the plane.  But when I saw it was over 600MB I stopped it.  Problem is that made iPhoto unavailable from Launchpad because it changed to a download prompt instead of the app.  It's not a deal breaker, as one could go to the Applications folder by exiting Launchpad or not using it, but it's something to note...Apple's got some work to do."Natural scrolling" is a joke.  It turns over 20 years of computing on its head and not in a good way.  I turned that stuff off the moment I saw it.  For those that don't know what this is, Apple has set the default scroll behavior to where the window will scroll in the same direction as where you scroll your fingers/mouse.  So for example, right now if you scroll a window down, the the page will go up so you read down the page.  That's logical.  In the default scroll of Lion, if you do the same downward scroll, the page will move down.  So if you want to read towards the bottom like normal people, you would scroll up, because you're "pulling the page up" in order to read downwards.  If it sounds confusing, it is.  I disabled this immediately.Those who are on the fence about this, think of this way.  If I asked you to get to the bottom of the stairs, what direction are you moving?  DOWN.  Down = Bottom.  That's logical, right?  So when looking at a piece of paper, if I wanted to go to the bottom of the page, I am reading DOWN the page. The analogy I stated before of "move the paper up to read downwards" works if my hands are directly on the paper.  But when I am not touching the paper, my eyes go down; the paper itself, say if laying on table, goes up.  That's why computer-based scrolling has worked for over two decades.  It's designed to work for your eyes, not for your hands."Natural scrolling" makes perfect sense on an iPad, because you're "touching the paper" directly, thus you would move the paper so that you can get to the next parts of what you're reading.  I didn't find it to translate well on a disconnected input medium like the trackpad at all.  Your Mileage May Vary, but in my opinion it's more clunky than it's worth, and I would rather it had been disabled by default, with options for users who want to try that input type that are converts from the iPad.Lion wants to remember open tabs by default in Safari.  So let's say you have 3 tabs open and you shut the browser down because you're finished.  In my mind if I close all three tabs it's because I'm done using them and the next time I open the browser I expect a clean slate; otherwise I would just use bookmarks. In Lion, by default, when you open the browser multiple times, it will reopen whatever tabs you had open the last time you ran it.  Even Reset Safari does not stop this behavior.  You have to disable it in System Preferences if you don't want it.Lion has taken a questionable direction with regards to design strategy.  It feels very much like Apple's strategy was to create an OS that could be used on both a computer and a tablet, and I'd be shocked if we didn't see a Lion version of the iPad down the road.  The problem is a lot of the features just don't translate well to a computer environment at all, yet would feel right at home on a tablet.  Things like rotating and the new Mail interface.  I know some people have reported things as bugs with Lion...I don't think they are.  I think a lot of what we are experiencing are intentional changes...and anyone who thinks it's a bug, is really feeling the negative impacts of the changes.  Call a spade a spade.In summary...do I recommend it?  That's a big YES.  The 2011 Air is a solid machine that IMO is hindered somewhat by a questionable OS design.  The hardware is spot on and what the Air really should have been in the 2010 revision.  The backlight keyboard adds significant value to the Air, and the 2011 just feels right.  The base 13" is a great value and well worth the money you spend on it.  It's not going to replace a Pro for many reasons.  But it's strong enough to be someone's primary if they really want it to be.  The review may sound like it's lower than a 4, but the more critical negatives are with Lion, not with the Air itself.  The Air itself is rock solid.  It's a strong VALUE and well worth the dollars you spend on it.  The higher end 13" is pushing it in terms of true value, as is the low end 11", but the high end 11" and the base 13" both are the best values in the Apple lineup right now.  The 13" Pro has a stronger processor but not by much, and you must add a SSD to make it slightly superior to the base Air.  That's the way it should have been from the get-go.  VALUE, people.  Value.::M.D.C. "Tempting Reviews"::4.0::July 23, 2011
R1FPOM71B0CMHK::Long time PC guy.  Not anymore::I've been a life-long PC user who thought people use Mac's so they can look cool in their pony tails and Patagonia jackets at Starbucks.  So when it was time to upgrade the 'ol Lenovo, the first thing I did was go to the PC store in our mall and look at the new PC's.  And there are lots of really cool ones.  I really liked the Sony Viao in particular.  Then I went to the Apple store and looked at the Mac's...and there is no comparison in terms of the actual physical machine.  The Apple is just much, much better built.  I was still about 90% sure I'd go PC though, because it's the software I'm worried about.  But since I was still a month or so out from the buy, I started asking people who looked more like me (you know...boring), at Starbucks and elsewhere, what they thought of their Mac.  100% of them loved them.  100%.  As in every...single...person.  It was universal. People who just switched, people who switched a while back, and people who have had only Apple ALL loved them.  I couldn't find a single person to complain.So I bought one.  And I love it.  Everything about it.  The only error message I've gotten on my MAC is from, you guessed it, the ONE Microsoft program I run (Office for Mac, which actually works well).  So here's the deal: the Mac just works.  It does everything well, and it's very intuitive.  I had a friend who switched tell me "if you can't figure out how to do something on your Mac, just sit back and think how a 10 year old would do it".  And he was right.  I was trying to move a bunch of pictures and getting frustrated because holding down shift and selecting images wasn't working.  I sat back and thought about it, then instantly figured it out.  You just slide over the pictures you want.  That's it.  There's no ctrl/alt/shift/f5 crap on a Mac.  There are no "This program performed an illegal operation and will shut down" warnings. No "Fatal exception occurred" messages that make you freak out that your hard drive just crashed.  Nothing like that.  When I turn it on, it fires up in about 10 seconds, and re-loads everything that was running when I shut it down.  They tell me that's because of the flash memory, but I just know it's awesome.I set mine up with a second monitor (not the Apple one for $1,200, I bought a Samsung for cheap), and it's awesome, I can have different stuff running on both screens.  Took about 30 seconds to learn.I can honestly say the ONLY thing I like better on the PC is how you can Explore for files.  On the Mac its called the "finder", and it's not as good.  But that's it IMO.I use my computer for basic office stuff, no programming, no heavy graphics, no gaming.  For personal use, it's web surfing and pictures.  I can't speak for the heavier uses, but for an everyday guy who travels for work and is on the computer all day, this thing rocks.  If you are worried about memory, buy a USB drive, you can get one for next to nothing now.The Mac is tiny, fast, reliable, and has great battery life.  I couldn't give it higher praise for the way I use a computer.  In fact, maybe I should grow a pony tail....::Chris R. Hotz "Real reviews.  No fake 5-star"::5.0::January 31, 2012
R19KE8KALCQM94::Absolutely love it::It's not perfect everybody knows that. Nothing in this world is perfect, but sometimes you just find something that just works for you. This computer just works for me.- I bike everywhere I go, even though I have a car, because it's fun. The thing about biking everywhere and leaving your house for the whole day is packing everything into your one bag. The MBA packs really really well leaving you PLENTY of space for everything else.-I multi-task a lot and the new Lion capabilities of full screen applications let's me do that even more. Going between the 5-10 PDF's and reading them is very easy using Lion's Gesture control and running . The upgrade to a standard of 4GB of RAM from 2GB was an absolute necessity because I am constantly using at least 3GB of RAM or higher while working.-I've never owned an Apple laptop and I love the light up keyboard. It's great because I tend to study late.-It pretty much does everything you want to do of the basics and can even handle HD Netflix streaming, but it does start up the fan into high gear and heats up the computer, but that's the only time it ever does. 95% of the time it runs silent (and I mean absolutely silent because that was a pet peeve of mine from my older laptops) making me love this thing even more.There are way more in depth reviews around here so I won't try to be an expert. Just as a regular person and student doing regular things, this computer does all you need. I don't play Games and I don't do video editing or complicated photoshop stuff on a day to day basis so this works great as my daily driver. I also say this from laptop experience.-I bought an Asus netbook and hated it because it was loud, heavy for its size, clunky, awkward, and shut down on me at random times. I eventually sold that thing on craigslist.-I owned a CR-48 (original chromebook) and the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook and realized I wasn't going to be able to multitask the way I wanted and it was still too much to carry on my back and bike with.I eventually just decided I was going to wait for this laptop and hope for the best. I got the best I could hope for and I love it.::S. Spediacci "Rowing is Life"::4.0::August 31, 2011
R2MSYI45XOU5EX::Powerful Features, Casual Interface::As a user interface enthusiast, I feel that a computer should be bought first based on the interface and second based on performance.  Luckily the Macbook Air 13" beats my expectations on both fronts.This Macbook Air was clearly made for Mac OS 10.7 Lion.  Having used Lion on an older computer without one of Apple's new multi-touch trackpads, I originally thought it wasn't a very big upgrade, but this MacBook Air proved my original thoughts wrong.  It still retains all of the power of Snow Leopard, and adds some new functionality too, while making everything seem much more casual and personal.  Four finger swipes between spaces and full screen apps is the best way to go about a handful of tasks at once.  Mission Control can quickly organize the most cluttered workspace.  There are also tons of nice little features that really make the computing experience seem much more natural and refined.  Over time, you'll start spotting small differences that really make a big impact in usability like being able to zoom into webpages in safari, holding down a letter on the keyboard to bring up accents, and letting Quick Look run in the background.The immediacy and intimacy of apple's iOS operating system has been brought over, making simple tasks like checking email, browsing the web, or writing a document feel much less constricted.  All of these things, of course, get the benefit of a bigger screen and a full qwerty keyboard.My first thing that struck me about the computer physically was just how compact it was.  Even now, whenever I pick it up or plug in a cable, I'm surprised about how much they could fit in such a tiny body.  Of course, there are some sacrifices to make it this thin, but nothing that has really bothered me too much.  No optical disk drive (more on that later), no firewire, no HD FaceTime camera, no external battery indicator...  These are all things found on the MacBook Pro line, but are absent from the Air and aren't horribly missed.  One concession that might bug people is in the keyboard.  Although it's backlight (which is much more useful than it sounds), the travel of the keys in about half of that found in traditional MacBook keyboards.  It bugged me a bit at first, but after just a few days it wasn't really an issue anymore, but if you're still on the fence, it's one thing to keep in mind.One thing to note is that if you're looking for a day to day computer, the 11 inch macbook air will probably feel a bit claustrophobic to most.  The 13 inch screen is definitely a breath of fresh air for me because feels much larger than it actually is.  Having used a 13 inch white plastic macbook for the past 4 years, I expected the screen to be similar, but in use, it's vastly better.  Colors look brighter and blacks look deeper, but the big difference is in the display's pixel density.  The 13 inch Air ships with a 1440x900 resolution screen, matching the 15 inch macbook pro pixel for pixel, but at a smaller size.  This makes texts and graphics look much crisper.  I've found that the interface in general has much more room to breathe than on the 1280x800 resolution screen found on previous 13 inch MacBooks and the current line of 13 inch MacBook Pros.Someone looking for great connectivity features might want to look at the MacBook Pro line as the MacBook Air has only two USB ports, and SD Card Reader, Thunderbolt port, and auxiliary in/out.  However, I've been surprised at how little I really miss the CD Drive.  If you're already seriously considering this computer, it's omission shouldn't be too much of an issue, especially if you share files mostly through SD cards, flash drives, or emails.  Of course, a $79 Apple CD Drive can be purchased and plugged in if you really need it.  It's definitely a good idea to get one now if this is going to be your only computer, but since the world seems to be going further away from physical media towards downloads exclusively, I could see that CD drive collecting dust a few years down the road.  I'd also like to note that wifi performance has been stellar so far, being able to pick up a stronger signal in most places than my phone or previous computer.Inside in Air is 256gb of flash memory and a Core i5 ULV processor, making the computer feel quick and zippy.  After Effects and Illustrator, two extremely large and intensive applications, boot up with unbelievable speed.  If you're going to use this just for light tasks and small applications, this computer packs more speed and power than you'll ever need.  Even if you're into more intensive applications, you'll still be pleasantly surprised by the performance.  While it's clearly no super computer, anyone who casually likes to play with the Adobe Suite, even monsters in it like After Effects or Photoshop, won't be upset.  As expected, rendering takes a while, but any slowdowns you might encounter aren't enough, for me at least, to get frustrated with the computer.  I've yet to experience an app crash, even Adobe After Effects, which used to force quit every time I tried to close a composition on my old MacBook.The Air feels like an obvious extension of both the established Mac line as well as iOS. When I had an old baseline MacBook, I couldn't imagine living without an iPad for simple tasks, because the old computing experience was so restricted and confined, but after using the 13 inch air with all of its OS X Lion glory, I completely understand why people wouldn't want something between a computer and smartphone.  Using the MacBook Air is the first time I've felt as engrossed into a desktop interface as I have with an iPad.  Everything about it feels more fluid and comfortable than any other full computer I've ever used.  When Apple announced the new MacBook Airs and killed the white plastic MacBooks, I was really confused, but now I fully understand their actions.  The white plastic MacBooks were the cheapest computers they sold that could do everything the average consumer wanted.  People bought them because they could do a lot for less, but with the matching price point of the MacBook Airs, they suddenly have much less appeal.  The great specs and power of the MacBook Air prove Apple's commitment to quality across all levels as it takes the position as the cheapest MacBook.  The MacBook Air is the first computer I've used that does everything I need it to and disappears when I'm using it so I can focus on what I'm doing.  Overall, the MacBook Air is a strong choice for anyone looking for a computer to use day to day and maybe even for a bit of serious computing.  Although in the future, it might be reflected upon as a transitory device in the convergence of iOS and Mac OS, right now it feels like the perfect combination of the two.  It's both comfortable in use and powerful, making the entire experience feel "just right."::Daniel Lipson::5.0::October 21, 2011
R2B63CWTLEDSE8::One laptop to RULE them all::Hello, this review is about my preciousss... MacBook Air 13 256gb (2011).I have been using Thinkpad laptops for the past 10 years.  My last one was a T410s.  It was mediocre.  This is my first Apple laptop, and I'm now a believer.  I've had this machine for over a month.I carry this around with me almost every day in my Booq bag.  I installed Windows 7 Ultimate via Boot Camp, which works great.  I now use Mac OSX Lion about 80% of the time, and Windows 7 20%.What I love about this MacBook Air:-- awesome battery life, at least 6 hours.  I've never run out of power.  I don't even carry around my power cord.  Just make sure to charge the laptop every night.-- OSX Lion.  There are so many features that you cannot get in Windows:  the multi-touch gestures, buttery smooth pinch-to-zoom in Safari, multiple desktops, and full-screen applications.-- excellent LCD quality.  The bottom right of my screen had some uneven lighting issues when I first got the laptop.  I guess that the problem was that the glue needed to settle.  After 1 week, the lighting became more even.-- 256gb SSD is more than enough space.  I partitioned 80gb for Windows 7, which I'm using to write this review.-- very quiet.  Goodbye, spinning hard drive! I guess that the heat management is pretty good because the fans rarely turn on in OSX.  In Windows 7, the fans can kick in when I have 2 Chrome windows open with about 12 tabs open, including espn.com.-- adjustable keyboard backlight.  I can type like 85 wpm and I infrequently look at the keyboard.  I like how I can turn off the keyboard backlight, or change its brightness between about 15 levels.Change requests:-- upgrade USB ports to the 3.0 standard-- that's about it for the hardware.  For the software, sure there are features and minor bugs that can get fixed in OSX.  But this review is mainly about the hardware, and it is nearly a flawless victory.SO... should I get THIS one, or the teeny tiny, cutsey wootsy 11 inch laptop?-- Dudes:  get the 13 inch laptop. Why?  the battery life and screen real estate (higher resolution)-- Ladies:  whatever you prefer.Summary:From the perspective of a salaried, college-educated guy who used Thinkpads for 10 years, I highly recommend getting this MacBook Air.  I give it a 5/5.  Everything works, and you can use Windows if you want to.  But give OSX at least 1 week, and I think that you'll see that it's far superior to Windows for everyday tasks.UPDATE, Oct. 10My friend who weighs about 165 lbs accidentally stepped on my Booq bag.  The dude stepped on the side that had my precious.  In my mind, I was like "precoussss!"  But it was during church service, and I waited until the end of service to check if there was any damage.  I opened the lid and saw that there was... no damage.HAHA, too bad clumsy foot!  Precious wins!::Albert Youn "Technical Recruiter"::5.0::September 29, 2011
R2XH2JJBST656E::Read this before buying (Updated June 2012)::I come back to this review with a bit more of information that I hope you might find useful.There are rumors that Apple will launch a cheaper and faster variant of this laptop on the third quarter of 2012, so if you can bear the wait, I predict it will probably be worth it.The Intel HD3000 integrated graphics card NEEDS to be upgraded for todays standards, this laptop heats up when playing HD video. Intel's Ivy Bridge HD4000 card is better and will probably come with the next version of this laptop.________________________This computer is built for a specific type of customer, so please make sure you fit the profile before buying it.Ask yourself these questions:1. Do you find yourself playing video games on your laptop?2. Do you use CPU-intensive programs such as iMovie or Handbreak?If your answers are yes, I strongly encourage you to but a 13' Macbook Pro. Alternatively, you can wait for next year's Ivy Bridge line of Macbook Airs, which will deliver better graphics.Now, if you work on your computer, if you go to college (like I do) and only need it to take notes, Skype, watch some videos, make documents and presentations and manage spreadsheets, this laptop is for you. I do encourage you to keep all your media on an external hard drive, because iTunes can fill up that 128 GB drive pretty fast.Pros:· 4 or 5 hours of battery use.· Fast, because it uses a solid state hard drive instead of a normal disk one.· OS X 10.7.2 is by far the most intuitive user interface I have graced my eyes upon.· 15' Macbook Pro resolution, meaning you have more pixels on a smaller screen, which is always great.· It CAN run taxing programs, but don't expect the greatest performance.· Trackpad and keyboard are the greatest I've seen.· Great for programs like Evernote and Word.Cons:· Heat, but you won't notice it that much, really.Final verdict:Make sure you are a person that won't find the graphic performance a hazard.I came from a Toshiba core i7 with 8GB of RAM and 512 of nVidia VRAm, and let me tell you that changing was the greatest idea I've had this whole year.::Julio R. Corzo M::5.0::December 14, 2011
R11DUFKZ5VSIZM::GREAT SOUND, GREAT SPEED, GREAT DESIGN, AVERAGE BATTERY::The most beautiful thing about this laptop is obviously how thin it is. It weighs maybe 1.3 kgs but it feels like it weighs nothing. Now there's a lotta talk about how the iPad 3 is going to be. Imagine a 13 inch iPad with better speakers, a better screen, a 128GB SSD, a lotta ram and a wonderful back lit keyboard. That is the macbook air. I doubt I will need to upgrade to an iPad 3 just yet when I have the macbook air. I have stopped spending hours with my lovely iPad 2 since I got this beauty, beast and God itself.I have an iMac from 2010 which has a intel core 2 duo at 3.06 GHZ. My macbook air runs at 1.7GHZ but has an i5 dual core processor... What does this mean in terms of actual performance? Well the macbook air takes less than half a minute to load, I never quite shut it down cause when i'm not using it I simply close the lid and that's that.Using a software available for free called Wontube converter, I tried to see which computer converts a 700 mb avi file into an mp4 faster and the laptop did it in roughly 8 minutes where as the computer took 90 seconds more. I think that is phenomenal speed. It is also remarkable the amount of technology that goes into  making a puny machine faster than the desktop.They both cost the same amount so I would really struggle if I had to choose between one. I love the fact that I can carry the AIR wherever I go. Also 120GB was free when I first received it. That is wonderful because I thought it's gonna somewhere around 100 and a few gigs.I can open multiple applications but I'm a little cautious cause it has a direct impact on the battery.It is not seven hours, it never has ran more than four hours. The brightness of the laptop is not as bright as the Macbook pro. Correct me if I'm wrong but using it in anything less than full brightness is not recommended. I  can keep my desktop at 25% less than optimal brightness and function properly but the laptop... I wouldn't.CAMERA - The camera is not good. I wouldn't use it for photo booth and clicking photographs, they appear grainy. My 2007 Dell Inspiron notebook has a better camera.SPEAKERS - Very good loud sound. A little louder than the iPad actually. They are very clear, the headphone jack is situated on the left but I wish it was on the right because if I'm using that and the usb port and the charger all at the same time it gets a little crowded. Anyway, the earphone speaker volume on max isn't that loud.WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY - So far not a single problem. The wireless is very finely tuned I find. It is super active and restless but not once has it given me the slightest hint of an issue at obtaining a signal.BATTERY LIFE - Advertized is seven hours, the maximum I ever get out of it is 180 minutes to about a max of 200 minutes or so.BLUETOOTH - Apple makes for a great generic inbuilt bluetooth and in a matter of a couple of minutes I had my android hooked to this computer and was transferring mp3s to and fro.iTunes - I recently enrolled in Itunes match and this ensures that even a laptop with just 128gigs of HDD has all my music on the go. A downside of itunes match is the fact that it downloads the song before actually streaming it but hey I can live with it when I have a 25k song limit on iTunes match's icloud.Keyboard - It is not a perfect keyboard, the lights seem a little cheesy when they are backlit to about 50%.Weight - Hardly any weight at all and I can hold for it for hours without getting tired. Weighs much less than my ASUS U35F-X1 Thin...let's say it weighs a feather over 2 iPad 2'sPortability - The Macbook Air 13 doesnt heat up like almost all of the Windows laptops I have ever used. Because it doesn't have an optical drive helps the cause but it remains a cool customer  all the time unless I am doing something processor intensive like converting video. But I gotta give it to Apple because their laptops NEVER HEAT.Lion seems to work better on my laptop than on my desktop. One reason for this could be the fact that I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion but nonetheless the desktop is substantially slower (thinking of a clean install..)I use TEXTEDIT for notepad because Apple doesn't have a native notepad.The trackpad is flawless. It is better than any laptop I have ever used.FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER OWNED AN APPLE NOTEBOOK -Let me explain a few things that make an apple laptop stand out from the others.1. No heat on your lap irrespective of what application you're running, it seems cool, the chassis never heats up like numerous laptops I've had in the past2. It's much lighter, Lion loads much faster on the macbook air than any other operating system I have seen load on any other machine I have used3. The magnet end of the charger easily attaches into the charging port on the mac, there is an AMBER light that displays itself when it's charging and it turns GREEN when the Mac has been completely charged.4. Setting up a macbook is easy, Apple doesn't load any bloatware because somehow this company manages to make everything seem genuine and intuitive for software as well. For example, the applications that I never used before like LAUNCH PAD etc seem more convincing on the Macbook Air than any other application a laptop pc manufacturer has loaded on their machines.5. Portability is divine. I do need a great perfect carrying solution though recommendations would be welcome. I do like sleeves but am open to any suggestion as to what others use.6. The screen resolution is optimized, I doubt you will ever change it, the icon spacing is beautiful, the track pad has various shortcuts, go to a store displaying this laptop and tell me you've seen a better looking computer. Watching a youtube video is a fantastic experience because 1080P truly pops out and there is a certain flow of programs which other computers don't have7. 2 USB outlets let you attach extra devices such as optical drive, external hard drive but I wish the HDMI port was something simpler and less "Apple'ized" ... Good luck finding a HDMI cable in India.CONS -The macbook air doesn't have the advertized battery life. I wish it lasted as long as a macbook pro. I hate having to close applications to save the battery. Also decreasing the brightness on this type of a screen makes it dull.  The Macbook pro can take more of a decrease in brightness than this machine can. When you turn the keyboard light all the way back, there is some light that escapes from the bottom and it makes your laptop look a little robotic. Certain businesses don't allow widescale access to INTRANET on wireless and asking for a wireless password is considered almost rude. This makes the absence of the Ethernet port a bit of a debby downer. Yes, you can buy an add on but still...WHY IT HOLDS UP AGAINST THE MACBOOK PRO -1. I don't really need an optical drive, I have a desktop Apple but if this is your only computer then I would consider the macbook pro or maybe an external USB optical drive (sounds odd to me honestly)2. The solid state drive and the i5 are both plenty fast. The boot up time for both machines is the same.3. The track pad, the keyboard, the overall feel is same on both except the macbook pro is heavier4. The macbook pro has a much better outlandish battery life so if that is of a lot of concern I would recommend the 15 inch oddity cause it's beautiful.I have previously owned notebooks by Compaq (running XP) Dell (running Vista and later Windows 7) and I also have an Asus U35F-X1 Thin running Windows 7. The Apple seems to beat them in terms of portability, design, size, performance, etc. I envision greater integration between Apple's operating system for their mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone, iPod (iOS) and their operating system for the desktops and notebooks (Currently Lion) in the future and it only seems believable that the Air will support those formats for a few more years. So the chances of this becoming obsolete are slim. I don't think this is that expensive especially considering just how much of a marvel the machine is. I love browsing the web on it but I need to further probe into keyboard shortcuts. I'm more aware of PC shortcuts than I am of MAC.**UPDATED 03/16**PS - When you connect an HDMI to this laptop using a converter, to transfer the image from the mac to the TV screen simply hold down "Command" and press "F1" - this basically duplicates your image to the tv screen. HDMI works pretty good.::Harkanwar Anand::5.0::February 27, 2012
R1G7R0QZ5RBR6P::Too Fragile - UPDATE - Solution!::UPDATE---(on bottom)Conceptually and on paper, this machine is awesome. After using it for about a month or so, it was still awesome. It is very snappy, and the trackpad is amazing compared to any other trackpad I have used. The display is not perfect (gradient mountains near the edge of the screen due to varying 'tightness' of the bezel), but decent for being on a laptop. They keyboard is backlight, adding value during use at night. Overall, it has been good computing experience.It stopped being awesome though, after I used it for what it is designed to be - portable. If you search on your favorite search engine "2011 MBA - Faint lines", it will be your first hit. If anything presses against the lid of the MBA while closed for an extended period of time, the keyboard will press against the screen - imprinting onto the LCD. This is a common occurrence for those who use a laptop...like a laptop and is honestly unacceptable. After bringing it to the genius bar, a suggestion provided to me is to simply use a hard cover case such that the pressure is applied to the case instead of the MBA lid. While an excellent suggestion, it undermines the purpose of the form factor of the MacBook Air - namely, portability from being extremely lightweight and thin. To travel without without fear, I would have to double the weight and quadruple the thickness.For those travelers out there - this is my warning, and may I also add that my ThinkPad 120xe and Alienware M11X never suffered damage due to being transported.Edit: If you're wondering whether or not this screen issue is a just cause for 1 star - it is. The screen heavily impacts the enjoyability of using the product. If it was just a matter of having a poor quality screen (such as one with very poor color replication), then the rating would have been based on how important I felt screen quality was. However, this is something entirely different - the screen is damaged during what I would consider to be normal and practical usage. As such, it is a design flaw that cripples the entire experience. I will attempt to find and upload a picture of related damage.UPDATE -- (Copy and paste of my review for the Razer Kabuto Screen Protector/Mousepad - refer to the product for a full review, I only copied comments relevant to the MBA)<review for the Kabuto>At first, I was told by the Apple Genius Bar technicians that placing something between the screen and the body would only reduce the clearance, and would do nothing to help with the issue. I decided that it certainly would not hurt (more) - and might even help distribute the pressure a little more evenly across the screen. Worse case,  /wave <$20.To my surprise, the cloth has work VERY well. Since I've used it, the white line issue is practically nonexistent.Now, to review the product:Pros - Thin! - but not TOO thin. I was certainly aware of the thickness of this cloth before I bought it. I chose this one over other (more popular / common) brands because this cloth adds the additional functionality of a mousepad (others are just cloths - I did find one that was a cloth, and a mousepad  - but that one was a tad too thick for the MBA - first hand experience - Everki). It was also 'slightly' thicker. I valued the thickness because I sought to provide more of a 'cushion' between the screen and the body. I deemed other cloths TOO thin.....DISCLAIMER - the fit within the MBA is not a 'perfect' fit. Meaning the lid does not close entirely (it is not a giant gap - but definitely a noticeable one if you care). If you want a cloth that closes entirely, you would want a thinner cloth (Shaggymac, Radtech). For me, the cushion was a requirement - a super thin cloth, in my opinion (it could be completely wrong!), could not protect as well as this cloth.</end of review>WITH this product, I would raise my rating to around 4 ish stars. Unfortunately, the Macbook Air does NOT come with a screen protector cloth, and will be leaving my reviewing of 1 star as a WARNING that a screen protector cloth is NEED - not to prevent scratches (with is the obvious reason why one would want screen protection), but to prevent the 'faint white line.'Good luck!::Minnus::1.0::December 18, 2011
R1Q810YH4R6PYZ::As a college computer science student, this is fantastic.::As a computer scientist who spends a lot of time programming and cares about both the functional and aesthetic qualities of my electronics, the ultrabook craze as of late has excited me a lot. The fact that I have used PCs almost exclusively for the last 12 years initially lead me away from considering a MacBook Air--after all, Apple's computers are expensive; they do have a reputation for all looking the same, acting the same, and being generally uncustomizable; and they have had a reputation for being incompatible with a lot of software out there.  But I found myself in a position where I want a secondary computer that is small, light, attractive, and dedicated for light use, like text editing/coding and recreation.  As it turns out, Apple has done something with this laptop that I never thought I'd dream of.The Macbook Air--*gasp*--is price competitive with its competition.Most comprable Windows ultrabooks, like the ASUS Zenbook UX31E-DH72 13.3-Inch Thin and Light Ultrabook (Silver Aluminum), right now are often only about $100-$200 or so cheaper than the Macbook Air now.  I think that there are many things that the Macbook Air brings to the table that make the premium worthwhile. This review is not going to focus much on the actual specs of the laptop, as you can glean that from any of the 90 5-star reviews this laptop has at the moment.  I will focus instead on why this is great against the competition.1) The user experience is fantastic. The trackpad alone could win me over for this one. For some reason, other laptop manufacturers can't get multitouch gesturing right, but Apple clearly put a ton of effort into something so overlooked--but so constantly used--as the trackpad.  Multitouch gesturing on Lion is just the best you'll find on any computer anywhere. It feels natural and makes navigating your computer effortless. Even ignoring that, I've rarely seen any hiccups while using the laptop in terms of things freezing up or the computer becoming unresponsive. While I do love Windows 7, the benefits of Apple's closed in environment is that they can control everything about the user experience, and so slowdowns and UI problems become a rarity. You really can presume that nearly everything's going to work right. Finally, all the components seem very solidly built. The keyboard has great tactile feedback, and the port selection, while limited, all works perfectly. The hinge of the laptop even clearly was thought about, as the resistance is pretty much ideal (no wobbling, but not difficult to move around). The screen resolution (1440x900)--while not as good as the Asus Zenbook--is better than most of the rest of the competition, and that's something that's important to me as a software developer since I like to be able to read documentation and type out code at the same time, a feat difficult on a low-resolution screen.2) The customer service is also great. AppleCare has a great reputation, and you get it for a year for free. I've used ASUS support before, and it's really, really annoying to have to wait a month without your laptop for service. There really isn't much comparison.3) As a software developer, I find it irking that Apple forces iOS developers to code on a Mac with a subscription fee to the SDK. But that's the nature of the beast--so having this laptop gives me the ability to do just that. Sure, it seems unfair and maybe I ought not develop for iOS because of the many subversive choices Apple made, but hey--it's not up to me, and it's easier and more stable than making my laptop into a Hackintosh, so I guess I'll play the game :PAnd finally, there are some complaints about heat. Using the laptop on your lap does make your legs feel pretty warm. I haven't had the laptop crash due to heat ever, though. It is to be expected, though, since the metal chassis is part of the laptop's cooling system, though I hope that in future revisions of the macbook they come up with a good way to avoid this issue.There's one other laptop that I haven't taken into consideration that in retrospect I wish I considered more seriously. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 (129126U) 13.3" LED Notebook - Core i5 i5-2520M 2.50GHz - 4G DDR3 320G HDD (Windows 7 Professional) - Black is a pretty good, and overlooked, ultrabook that seems like a great alternative, especially considering that you can get an extended battery that brings the battery life of that beast to an inhumane 22 hours or so while still being pretty small and light.  If you're looking into high-end ultrabooks, I'd limit my search to the Macbook Air, the Asus Zenbook, or the Thinkpad X1 at this point (the Sony VAIO VPC-Z212GX/B 13.1-Inch Laptop (Black) is very cool too, but also too expensive for me to take seriously). Also, you may want to wait for the near future when one of two things happens: a) the new Intel "Ivy Bridge" chips come out, as this may make laptops have even better performance and battery life; and b) Windows 8 comes out--I think that Microsoft's latest revision to their OS may have the potential for changing things big time in the market, so unless you feel good about Apple as it stands, I would consider waiting for that to come along.Hopefully this review will help some of you in the search for the latest and coolest laptops around :) Let the best manufacturer/operating system win!::Omar Diab "Sebastian"::5.0::February 2, 2012
R2O74X4FL6W96C::WOW- just amazing.::I have traditionally been a 13" Macbook Pro user since they have been the most fully outfitted laptops in Apple's line-up. When the AIr came out a few years ago, I remember thinking that I really liked the idea of an ultra portable, but was worried about the lost functionality that came along with it (ethernet port, fire wires, optical drive). Since then my usage has changed a lot. I print and connect to the internet wirelessly, so the ethernet port does not matter anymore. All of my software is downloaded (legally of course) and I have not needed to burn a CD or DVD in 3-4 years, thus the optical drive issue is gone. This latter point matters because I use flash drives to move large files and anything up to 15MB I just e-mail. Port issues aside, there is a lot to recommend the Air over a 13" Pro. The air's screen is less reflective and higher resolution. To my eyes it's just better. The air is light. I never thought a 13" Pro was heavy until I used an Air for a bit. The Air is faster in day-to-day usage than the 13" pro. Both use i5 processors, the same GPU and have 4GB of RAM. The kicker is the flash-based drive in the AIr is WAAAAY faster than the regular HD int he 13" Pro. Side by side, I think the air is the way to go. If you really must have an optical drive, you can sync the Air up to another Mac and use its drive or Apple sells one for $80, but before you buy one, try the Air on its own and you might just be surprised about how well you get along without it. Note: The 15 an 17 inch Pro have much more sophisticated graphics processing and for those needing the extra GPU power, neither the Air nor the 13" Pro is the best choice. I mention this because my review compares the 13" Pro to the Air only.::Ryan H. Smith::5.0::April 30, 2012
R11XYTQCM68HTM::PC guy for 25 years turns to the dark side::So for the last 25 years I've been using PC's. From my 4mhz 8088 PC clone with 2x 360k floppy drives and 512k of RAM with a monochrome screen to my current desktop PC which is a 6-core, 16 gig ram, RAID-0, RAID-1, NVIDIA 560ti video with 1gig RAM and 2x 24" monitors. I had never considered a Mac previously and always considered them to be nothing but overpriced PC's in a shiny case built and designed for computer illiterate individuals seeking a point-and-click appliance. How could I have been so wrong?This laptop is simply the best product I've ever purchased, period. My head, being in the PC world, couldn't even comprehend how elegant and wonderful this laptop could possibly be. I had no frame of reference for a "GREAT product" because, coming from the PC world, I had never experienced that. EVERY laptop I have previously owned or used had something that was sub-par. Sure, 90% of other laptops are good, but they always leave something to be desired. For instance the track pad might be finicky, or the keyboard design may be sub-par, or the built-in speakers aren't loud enough, or the machine is heavy, or noisy, etc. There is nothing sub-par on this machine.- The thing is as light as a feather- Battery lasts 7hrs- Battery charges quickly- Track pad is the best thing I've ever used- Keyboard is shockingly usable and prevents errors, it's a joy to type on- Screen is bright, vibrant, and beautiful- It doesn't get hot- I never hear any fans or anything... maybe 2x's since I've gotten it has it used it's fans- Web cam is great, high res, and works flawlessly- Speakers sound great- Even the power cord is brilliantly designed... and that's just the hardware.OSX, being now based on UNIX, is a dream come true. It makes doing every-day computer tasks a breeze and as simple as point and click. BUT, never fear, you have the full power of UNIX under the hood so if you want to get deep, you absolutely can. I had wrongly ASSumed that OSX was for dummies. Again, I couldn't be more wrong. Within hours I had my macports repository set up and was sucking down Nmap, GTK+, and all sorts of things I would do on my Ubuntu box. I was running Python scripts, writing scripts, running ifconfig... it was great!Oh, so then I decided to fire up Eclipse and try debugging some Android code. After installing Eclipse I tried to fire it up and when I did it complained about not having a Java SDK installed. "Great, let the nightmare begin", I thought to myself. Not so fast! My Mac popped up a window that said, "Oh, hai! I see you don't have the proper Java SDK to run Eclipse, lemme go get that ish for you, cool?". Stunned, I pressed OK, and it went out, got the proper SDK, installed it, and re-launched Eclipse all ready to do. Let me just say the Eclipse install on a PC is... shall I say, slightly more involved.I grabbed my Galaxy S phone, plugged it into my laptop and VIOLA! It just worked! No endless driver installations, no driver conflicts, etc. It was great. So then, just for kicks, I unplugged my Galaxy S, plugged in my Galaxy Nexus and guess what? No drivers necessary, it just worked! Amazing.Another thing that surprised me about OSX was the apps. Everything about them. They are abundant, beautiful, and feature rich. Many of the cross platform apps such as Skype are far superior on the Mac. Not to mention that the apps that aren't free, such as Keynote (Apple's version of PowerPoint), are dirt cheap. Keynote was $19.99 and in my brief experience of crafting a 30 minute slide presentation, far superior to PowerPoint.I've seen the light. Trust me, I didn't want to, but it's impossible to ignore. I'm a convert. I don't think I'll ever buy another PC again, unless it's for gaming.::Eric Maxwell::5.0::April 9, 2012
R366CF267HRKUT::Macbook Air: A different perspective::I purchased this directly from the Apple store and not from Amazon.com. I have owned the product for about two weeks.I will try to avoid repeating what has already been said in many of the other reviews for the Macbook Air and offer you my own perspective and decision-making process before the purchase and thoughts after the purchase.Before I purchased...I have been a long time Windows OS user and really the only Apple product I owned up until this purchase was my iPhone4. I had plenty of desktops at home and work, but I needed a new personal laptop I could take with me when I'm on the go. I would like to think I'm in the majority when it comes to having a very usable laptop that's also portable. It doesn't need to do intense gaming, it doesn't need the best graphics card out there, but it DOES need to be light and it DOES need to do daily tasks well.I researched...I certainly wasn't in the Apple camp just yet and looked at several notebooks from HP, Samsung, Toshiba, Lenovo. I looked at all notebooks, but something about the thin and light ones just really caught my attention. I wanted to be careful though because in the world of technology there are always trade offs. To my relief it appeared that the thin and light notebooks out in the market had all gotten to a point where they were now very capable machines. They were certainly not up to the performance of their thicker brethren, but they were now considered very usable with a price premium that was still within budget. (See the complaints about the first generation thin notebookes like the original Macbook Air if you want to know more about some downsides).Thin and light...The final contenders in the running were the Samsung 9, the Lenovo X1, and this Macbook Air. If you looked at price and performance they're on a level playing field. As the typical consumer though we tend to evaluate beyond just the speeds and feeds. It came down to aesthetics and feeling around the brand. Long story short, Apple won. The OS was not an issue for me because there are several ways you can set your Macbook up to run Windows.The kicker...I would be traveling internationally and Apple clearly offers an international warranty. You can take them to any Apple store to get them fixed. It was not clear what kind of "limited" international warranty were being offered by other manufacturers. I have noticed international warranties are usually NOT standard on typical consumer PCs. Business PCs are another story.After I purchased...Everything works well and the notebook is as speedy as everyone says. There are certainly little things I noticed here after I got this computer.I did try some light 3D gaming and the laptop would get hot especially near the upper part of the keyboard.The large trackpad is easy to use and the surface is a very nice anti-friction material. You would be surprised how many laptop manufacturers get the trackpad surface wrong. The ability for it to recognize a finger vs. your palm resting on it while typing on the keyboard is one of those little features many don't notice.The magsafe adapter is a great design and still beats the traditional plug-in power because there is no harm down if you accidentally pull it out by say tripping over the wire.The power adapter is tiny and doesn't get warm. It also comes with an interchangeable extension cord if the default cord is too short for you.OS X Lion has taken some time to get used to, but it wasn't terrible. I did not end up installing Windows :).The one thing I have NOT liked about the Macbook Air though is that for some reason the notebook screen puts more stress on my eyes than other screens. I can not pinpoint exactly why, but it happens.Conclusion: I gave it 4 stars because I have only had it for a few weeks, but if this notebook lasts me past the warranty period it deserves a at least a 4.5 rating.::DSO::4.0::October 16, 2011
R39QVZ4ZL7IOJ0::Simply amazing!  Best Apple laptop to date!::Although I was thinking of making a "summarized" review, I think this product really deserves a thorough go through.  Just to let you know, I switched over to Mac a little less than 2 years ago, and since then I've had 3 Macbook Pro's and a 27 inch iMac.  As of the purchase of this item I had the 2011 13 inch MB Pro with their 2.8 GHz processor, plus the 2010 27 inch iMac.  Both have memory and HD upgrades.  With this in place, let me get into details:1. Fit and finish, weight, look and feel - Without a doubt this is simply put the best laptop Apple has gotten out in this sense, period.  The machine is significantly lighter than a MacBook Pro, which is a plus being a frequent flier and having to put this on my shoulder along with various cables, an iPad, an iPod and small documents.  The look is all Apple, brushed aluminum with the light up Apple in the middle...  The only down side I've found to Apple's laptops is that they do dent quite easily.  I found this out the hard way since with my previous MB Pro I left the internal zipper in my laptop case not fully closed, and the pressure with alot of documents inside literally made a small ding on my top cover (backside of the screen).  Unfortunately no spare parts to replace this, and repairing would've meant replacing the entire top panel (including the LCD screen) for over $800.2. Features - Again, this machine gets top marks, but does have its drawbacks.  Firstly, the 2011 Airs now have backlit keyboards (again) which is a plus if you work in low light conditions (in my case, on a plane at night).  The computer includes an HD webcam (Facetime camera) which again if you travel and a friend or loved one has one of the more recent Macs or iDevices (iPhone 4, iPad2) you can do videocalls using Apple's facetime feature at no cost and with minimal setup.  Display is not edge to edge like on Macbook Pros, which is a bummer, but it's not noticable if you're coming from another Air or a Windows PC.  As to connectivity, computer has an SD card slot, a Thunderbolt port and 2 USB 2.0 inputs...  And that's it.  This means that everything you have to connect will basically be via a USB.  Therefore, if you need a wired network connection, buy an adapter and take up a USB port...  Need to read a CD or DVD, buy an external Superdrive and connect to a USB port...  This means that you will surely have to purchase a USB hub (if you use external drives you will surely have to purchase a powered hub), so all of this eventually adds up in price.3. OS - For those which use Snow Leopard, Lion is definitely an important step forward in the right direction.  If you don't but already use an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad, many things will seem familiar.  Lion now uses gestures, which basically allows you to use multiple fingers to swipe or move in a direction on your trackpad to do certain items.  I won't go into great detail here but items such as Mission Control and Launchpad are definitely impressive and very user friendly, although many hardcore users will not find themselves using it too much.4. Performance - OK, here's where I leave the best for last.  To be honest, I'm reviewing my Macbook Air I purchased for my wife, since my original plans were not to "downgrade" to the air from a Macbook Pro.  For those of you who don't know, Airs use SSD drives.  In short, this means they are enormous USB pen drives.  The result of this is much lower power consumption, no need to power off the computer when moving it (SSD's have no moving parts, so there's no risk of damaging your hard drive due to motion shock) and the two most important things... very little probability of data loss due to hard drive failure and IMPRESSIVE SPEED!  Although the Air has a lower processor speed than the Pro, the SSD more than makes up for this for common tasks (combined with Lion's efficiency).  From the time I press the power button on the laptop to the moment I get my logon screen... 8 seconds!  To the moment I type in my logon credential to the time the computer is ready to go (with all background processes loaded including antiviruses and indexing programs) 5 seconds!!  I use the Air for virtualization (running windows within my Mac OS) and it is quite fast and responsive for basic tasks, and I also use it for some minor flash animation and other general tasks, and the computer has not disappointed at all.  The only part I have specifically seen a drop in performance versus the Pro is when working with video, such as converting files from one format to another to sync with my iPad.  Otherwise stellar marks.5. Upgradability - Unfortunately, here the Air gets a failing grade.  Basically how you buy the maching is how you will have it.  No options to upgrade RAM or HD (soldered to the motherboard and in the case of the SSD it's an Apple proprietary design) so this has made me have to be creative in cleaning out all of my "non frequently used files" off my laptop since the HD maxes out at 256 GB.  An external HD is a must for photos, movies and music if you have a decent sized collection.So in short, after working a couple of days with my wife's air, I was so impressed that I sold my Pro and purchased one for myself.  Although I don't do my heaviest work on it (I have my iMac for that) it is spectacular for everyday office use and even some heavier than usual lifting...  Definitely something worth buying!::H. Sole::5.0::August 22, 2011
RVHO5MN6QEXLQ::Apple finally got it right...::Finally took the plunge and bought a Mac. Been waiting for the updated MBA and now that it's out, it does not disappoint. I will not get into reiterating features but instead just make a few observations from the perspective of a 20 year PC user who just bought his first Mac today.1) Been using it about 4 hours straight on my lap and doesn't generate nearly the same heat as a Windows laptop. Makes me wonder where all the heat IS going though....2) New gestures and trackpad features on scroll pad are extremely intuitive. I did make one change from default which was to make the bottom right the secondary click. Especially love the 4 finger up-scroll for the dashboard and mission control. Really eliminates the need for a mouse. And Natural Scrolling takes about 15 min to get used to... honestly.3) A previous reviewer wrote that the graphics don't "pop" off the screen and I tend to agree. Even though resolution is increased, was expecting a little more. I think the biggest problem is with the text - doesn't seem clear in some settings. I sure hope Apple has an update for this. On the good side, the new 1440 x 900 resolution is wonderful. Not quite 16 x 9 ratio but pretty darn close and you get a ton of text to fit on the screen.4) This laptop really does feel unbelievably thin and light. We know the specs but when its in your hands, its a different story and Apple hit the mark here.5) SSD drive is instant on and super fast. This boots up and wakes faster than any computer I've ever owned by a LONG shot (I boot up in less than 10 seconds). 128 GB is more than enough for everyday use IMO. Buy an external drive if you need more. The 128GB 13" model is the best value IMO.6) Viewing angles great side to side not so great vertically, but not too relevant anyway on a laptop IMO.7) A little surprised that we didn't get an HD FaceTime camera but just SD. I guess sacrifices had to be made somewhere to keep the price point - we got so many other upgrades so not complaining too much about this one, just an observation.8) This computer can be your primary IMO - its got all the right features and is now just as powerful as the MB Pro.All in all - Apple did a great job and finally created a MBA that is for the masses and will satisfy the masses. This notebook is the PC killer.... at least it was for me.Update 8/2: Now that I've been using this for a week, the fan does get a little louder if doing high processing requirement tasks like streaming video. Otherwise, it runs completely silent for web surfing and other administrative tasks.::R. Chen "wahoodude23"::5.0::July 25, 2011
R1J1WVOGRTROAA::I love this thing for school::I just got my macbook air from best buy and it has been great for school and note taking. Word for mac has a notebook view that makes taking and organizing notes really easy. The battery on this thing lasts a long time if all you are doing is in class using word for taking notes. If you are worried about being able to get through a day of school with light internet use and heavy note taking it should last you all day easily. After using mine for 6 hours straight of mainly note taking with maybe a half hour or an hour of internet web browsing thrown in my macbook was still at 22% Over all I am really happy with my purchase =)::Dexter "Dexypoo"::5.0::February 15, 2012
R35LFLR8X95L6M::WOW! This is an amazing laptop::This is my first Mac product. I have owned Windows laptops since 1997. From Dells to Vaios. From general corporate level stuff from Dell to top of the line Vaios - X, Z and FW. I was a little hesitant on buying this Mac, but I am glad I did!1. The instant on and off is a great feature and truly makes this a portable device.2. It is FAST and it runs cool. This was a first for me. I can't remember a singe time I have heard the fan (if there is one!)3. Mac OS X is just amazing. As a long time Windows user I can say that I like everything about OSX better. I guess you have to use it to realize just how refined the OS is. I love Time Machine and many of the included apps. Even the external display feature is very well implemented.4. Other little things like the fantastic keyboard, the mouse and build quality.I have the i7, 256GB model.  I'll update my review as I keep using it. I am now officially a convert :)::Jaffrey W. Ali "Relentless Pursuit of Technology"::5.0::October 7, 2011
R15TR6231SQ08R::Overall an amazing laptop::Despite knowing that Apple may release the updated version of Macbook Pro, I chose to buy Macbook Air 2011, and I have to say all my reservations about the Air are gone.This is an incredibly well-designed, super light and very efficient laptop that should fit most people's needs in my opinion.What I love:- Design: I have used Windows based PC all my life and after using Macbook Air, I have to say the quality of design of this Apple product is superb. It has really clean, minimalist design that looks aesthetically pleasing. I also love the aluminum unibody. And the backlit keyboard is not only useful but also visually pleasing.- Screen: While not the retina display found in iPhone and iPad (the new one), I'm overall happy and impressed with the Air's clear and crisp screen quality.- Weight: Ultra-thin and really light. What more can I say? :)- Snappy: this is the fastest and the most responsive laptop I've ever used. It boots in like 5 seconds (unlike my previous samsung laptop that took literally at least 3 minutes to finish booting). It opens applications almost instantaneously. The internet experience is just as snappy. No more waiting!- Battery life: I'm sure the battery life depends on individual's usages, but based on my experience, the Air lasts me at least 6 hours, sometimes 7. I mostly use the Air for writing and modifying documents using Word, using Safari for web browsing, watching videos and listening to music via iTunes. However, the battery life seems to deteriorate when using Skype.- General usability: This is my first Apple laptop, so at first I didn't know what to expect. I did need to adapt somewhat because mac OS is different from Windows. But after a week of use, the general experience of using the Air has been outstanding. There's hardly any freezes. Everything just goes smoothly and seamlessly.What could be improved:- Heat: the heat and fan noise hasn't been a problem for me, but I did witness that when I'm using certain applications like Skype or Handbrake, the Air did get noticeably warm and the fans kicked in.  However, in most circumstances, not much complaint here, but I still thought  I would mention this.Conclusion: this is a really well-built laptop. I got 256GB i5 Air, and this is the best laptop I've ever used so far. As long as you're not a heavy user who needs to run power-consuming programs, this laptop should be perfect for every-day user. Also being a college student myself, I definitely recommend Air to other students because it is light, really portable without breaking your back with already heavy backpack, great battery life, and outstanding overall usability. Unless you really want the new Pro, I think Air is a great investment.::kjra2250::5.0::June 6, 2012
RN1CIG3NDWX6L::Absolute best laptop I've ever owned!::I've had a regular MacBook from 2007 that is still going strong but I wanted something lighter so I finally pulled the trigger to buy this MacBook Air. At first I was worried that the screen might be too small but it doesn't feel that way at all to me. So glad I bought this beautiful piece of machinery. Apple never fails to impress!::Sohrob Tahmasebi::5.0::March 1, 2012
R2TOZXCACFQUVT::Best laptop I've ever used.::I've owned four laptops in my lifetime. The first two were hp and the last two have been macbook airs. My first laptop was quite a few years back and it was mainly used for school. The second laptop I got was an HP Envy 13, after my first laptop I just wanted something that I didn't need to have plugged in after 2-3 hours of use, or in other words ONE class. The envy did not fulfill this at all (there's a reason they called it a macbook clone). So after the first revision of the macbook I decided okay lets try this out. WOW! not only did it last me more than one class without charging, I was able to get through THREE 2 hour classes without charging AND still have about 50% battery life. Keep in mind I would tweek my settings to get those results (low brightness, minimal browser use, MS word or excel open the whole time). My only complaint was that the first revision was a bit sluggish and it could be felt when I would have multiple browser windows open. The second revision (2011) took care of this one complaint I had, while still not as speedy as a top of the line desktop, you have to keep in mind that you need to make some concession for portability. Its thin, its fast, the flash hard drive is zippy. I do have some accessories as well, the superdrive that I use sparingly and don't even take with me 90% of the time (disks, who uses disk now?), and the usb to ethernet adapter just in case you venture into some third world location that does not have wifi (just kidding).::vasq::5.0::February 2, 2012
R12VUXARHERF4S::Excellent Mac Notebook But Lot of Keyboard and Trackpad Problems in Bootcamp Windows::It is a beautiful Mac notebook computer. The only problems I have had with the Mac OS part is that lot of the legacy Mac programs, including Microsoft Office 2004 & 2008 do not work in the new OS Lion.But if you use Windows programs in Bootcamp then there are a lot of problems.This has Bootcamp 4 and their trackpad and keyboard drivers do not work well. The keys constantly keep moving positions and the trackpad can be clicked only in the right front corner. Scrolling also does not work well. The trackpad and keyboard work very well in Bootcamp 3 on my MacBook Pro. But Apple has still not fixed these issues in Bootcamp 4.::SanjeevP "Bottom Line"::4.0::December 22, 2011
R3CKIEYLGXS76Z::Awesome laptop, graphics inferior to 2010 version::We own both the 2010 version of this laptop and the 2011 version (this model). The 2010 version has a Core 2 duo processor with an NVIDIA graphics card embedded. The 2011 version has an i5 processor (Sandy Bridge) but Intel integrated graphics (to be clear, the model being reviewed here). Both laptops have 4GB of memory and 256GB hard drives. The 2010 version, which I personally carry, is the best laptop I have ever owned. The solid state drive makes it more than fast enough for everything I do. Even running Windows 7 in vmware is fast enough to not be bothered by the virtualization. I love that laptop.This 2011 version we bought for my wife. This laptop is even faster but the graphics is inferior. I play Starcraft with my son and the 2011 Macbook air is a step backwards from the 2010 version in terms of performance in that game. Sure it works, but it's not as fun. it's glitchy. In fact, it seems more glitchy than a 3 yr old Macbook with older integrated graphics.This is not really a revelation as many blogs have pointed out that the 3D graphics in the 2011 version are a step backwards from the 2010 version. But unfortunately, while the 2010 version had adequate graphics and CPU performance, the 2011 version has inadequate graphics performance and more than adequate CPU performance. I would not be happy with this laptop. My wife on the other hand, loves it. She does not game so if Excel opens a microsecond faster or a web page renders more quickly, it's a pure win for her.In my opinion, if you care about 3D graphics performance, you might be better off with a used 2010 Macbook air.  When Apple comes out with a 13 inch Air based on the Intel Ivy Bridge chipset, buy that and resell your 2010 Macbook. Ivy Bridge is rumored to have better graphics.::Andrew Erlichson "phanfare"::4.0::December 13, 2011
RR3NDGPMC747O::I love it, and I hate it::I've had my MBA for a few months. I had a MBP (running Snow Leopard) prior to this which was stolen. I love the size and lightness of the MBA. I love the modern, chiseled look, the trackpad, the performance, and all the apps (which work great most of the time). The App Store is fabulous. Its a great place to find an app for almost anything. I say almost because it doesn't have everything. There's a lot more SW available out there on the web though.What I don't like about the MBA are the frequent lockups requiring a force reboot, or the many times I've had to force quit an application, or restart it because it crashed. Its frustrating. I've had more issues with this laptop than I've ever had with a PC. I'm not a fan of Microsoft either, but lately I've just been doubting all the hype out there about Mac reliability and stability. As far as I'm concerned, its BS. Don't get me wrong, I still love this little machine, but I wish it was more stable. It also gets a bit hot when creating and sometimes viewing video and the fan will kick up to full speed.My MBP seemed to be much more stable and run a lot cooler. Lion has too many issues. I don't see updates coming as often as I would like. What are they sitting around doing at Apple? I don't care about a stupid iTunes update (which I seem to get all the time), I need updates that are going to make my system more stable. I need them to fix Lion!I'll keep putting up with the issues I guess. I'll take my MBA to the apple store as often as I can to get help... which is a really nice option to have!There a whole lot of things to like about this machine. Like I said, I love it... but at the same time I sometimes hate it.Update 2/10/12: got a Lion SW update recently (ver 10.7.3), and its been more stable so far.Update 6/1/12: Been quite stable last several months. I love this thing. I don't hate it anymore.::Doodle Meriwether::4.0::January 31, 2012
R2NM6QSNR7NNN5::Nice but not worth the $$$::Thanks to my profession I have been able to use a Mac AIR over a year and have been recently upgraded to latest version of one.Overall its a great lap top but its also $1000.  You could get a more powerful Wintel laptop for half the money.  I realize that is sacrilege to MAC OS guru's.  But the fact is as easy and solid as apple tries to make OS X and MAC hardware they both still have some issues.- Both versions of the mac air I use and a MAC pro I also use constantly drop WIFI.  While non-mac laptops attached to the same WAP do not drop.  The frustrating thing is the apple goes out of their way to hide all of the real advanced settings that may actually fix the issue.  I understand they want to make these things like a toaster and thats fine, but some time you need to open the "hood" and fiddle with the "engine".  OS X is based on a UNIX variant and I have been working on various UNIX flavors for 16 years, I am no stranger to UNIX OS's.  But even at the CLI level they hide many of the advanced tools that one could use if one should run into an issue.  Of course you can pack the thing up and take it to the genius bar, which may cost you money.BTW in windows or linux you are able to get to the advanced settings easily enough if needed.-  As much as I don't love windows because of its instability, make no mistake OS X is not immune.  While it is overall more stable than windows 7 it does have its moments of instability.  Run it too hard or open too many windows it can freeze or hang.  Matter of fact I notice when I run the airs and the pro hard I see bluetooth devices loose connectivity, especially the mouse, and the only way to get it back is to reboot.  Wait I thought windows only did that, well OS X does too unfortunately, albeit not as much.- OSX still is safer than windows as far as viruses go, but that is because there are more virus written for windows.  IT is not because OS X is immune.  Purchasing virus software is a good idea.-  Software is still kind of limited for the Mac, and the ones that are available are usually pricy.  Sometimes I just want to play a game, but most of the good ones run on windows.  If you are not  a gamer or power user and just want something to surf the net why pay the big bucks when you can get a Acer for under $400.I can ramble all day with the comparisons but end of the day the Mac air is a cool device and sleek but I wouldn't dole out my money for it.::Amazon Customer::3.0::January 29, 2012

R3OC969Z2DGDHD::This Laptop is a Better Choice for Many Road Warriors than the Macbook Pro::Well folks, I received my 13" MBA yesterday, and I wanted to provide my impressions. Mine has the 256GB SSD, a $300 upgrade over the base model.  Some are comparing this laptop to the 11" MBA.  However, for many, the 13" MBA is now powerful enough to be considered a replacement for bigger Macbook Pro Computers. Rather, it's about how well I think this computer will address my needs.  If your needs (computing and travel) are similar to mine, you might find my impressions useful. I won't discuss performance.  I don't run benchmarks, and the benchmarks I've seen so far show that this computer is much, much faster than my nearly 4-year-old MBP, which is my most important performance requirement.Based on my initial impressions, I say that the reasons to purchase a MBP instead of a MBA have been reduced drastically.  These reasons include*Needing the most powerful laptop available (a desktop replacement)*Running programs that need/can use more than 4GB of RAM*Needing greater storage (SSD chips get real expensive real fast)*Wanting or needing a 15 or 17" screen.*Needing a greater variety and number of IO portsFirst, a little about me so that you can determine whether my computing needs are similar enough to yours.  My needs and desires for a laptop include being able to take it on the road with me and duplicate much of what I do in my office on trips lasting from one day to two-weeks. I, therefore, eliminated the 11" MBA because its screen is simply too small for use as a primary computer for more than a day or two.  I need to be able to remote connect to my office computer and sync daily using Dropbox and Sugarsync.  My most used programs are Safari, email (I use Thunderbird but will consider transitioning to Apple Mail in Lion), MS Office (Word, Excel and Powerpoint), and for my photography addiction, Lightroom and Photoshop. So, I do not engage in heavy lifting in my computer use.  The 256GB seems like an excellent storage compromise.  My old laptop had 250GB of storage and that proved adequate, and I have no doubt that this will still be the case.  I found that for the type of computing I do, having a fast SSD enhances the usage experience far more than a faster processor.  I had a fast SSD installed into my 2010 iMac.  The iMac was far faster than the Mac Pro that I use at work which doesn't have an SSD.  Of course, this assertion would not be true if I edited video or ran elaborate statistical analysis etc.As for size, the MBA's surface area is pretty big, but it's much smaller than the 15" that it replaces. The thickness--or rather, thinness--of this machine is amazing. For me, next to a current generation MBP the rear at .68" is noticeably and significantly smaller than the .95" of the MBP. More importantly, the width rapidly decreases in size down to .11".  This laptop will go anywhere.  I will have no problem stuffing it into any bag I have or sliding it into the magazine pouch in the back of the airplane seat in front of me.  As suspected, the wedge shape facilitates putting this laptop  in many tight places.  What I didn't realize, was that it is just so super thin throughout, that stuffing this laptop into tight places will rarely be a problem. I live in a medium-size town with a small airport served by small jets. In the past, if I wanted to put my overstuffed bag in the small overhead bin, I invariably had to remove my MBP. I have no doubt that that will be much less of a problem with this laptop. In, fact I will get more space by removing a book, magazine or report from my bag. It will also be less of a hassle removing and reinserting the MBA in my bag when going through airport security.  Thus, I suspect that I will value the size relative to larger laptops more so than the weight difference.On the weight, this bad boy is heavier than expected.  I guess I've gotten used to carrying around an iPad. I'm no body builder, but I'm in pretty good shape.  I still bench press 140lbs and backpack with a 30lb load. Nonetheless, 3lbs is above the "I don't think about it, just take it with me all the time" weight. I haven't picked up the 11", so it is hard to imagine that the 1/2 lb would make much difference. But as someone else who had both the 11 and 13 said, they found that they took the 11" with them more often than they took the 13", so even small differences in weight matter. Suffice it to say, I'm glad it's not any heavier. Clearly, the 1.5 lb difference between this MBA and the smallest Macbook Pro is not something that I want to consider. The MBP's added weight just creates an additional reason to think about whether to take it with you, which in my mind defeats the purpose of portable computing.The screen is excellent. It's very clear. One feature that I hadn't realized previously is that its native resolution is 1440x900, the same as the 15" MBP.  By contrast the 13" MBP is 1280x800 and the 11" MBA is 1366x768.  This statistic provides a pleasant surprise.  It makes using this laptop less of a compromise than I had originally thought. The negative is that text characters are smaller than I'm use to.  I'll have to see whether I get use to it.Finally, and perhaps the biggest negative is Apple's failure to add cellular capabilities to this machine. Having the ability to access the Internet anytime and anywhere would provide tremendous value for me.  The Sony Vaio has it (albeit at a much higher price), so the technology exists.  This absence was almost a deal killer for me, which is why I gave the MBA a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating.  What got me over the hump was that I really wanted a smaller computer than my 15" MBP and the knowledge that Apple laptops really hold their value.  If Apple comes out with a MBA with cellular capabilities in the next year, I will be able to sell this laptop for 70-80% of what I paid for it. So my investment will be cheaper than leasing it for the same period.Overall, a very impressive machine.  The size is a huge plus.  The weight is acceptable, but I'd love it if it were closer to 2lbs.  The screen is excellent.  It strikes a good balance between being compact yet big enough to get work done.  I am quite please with this laptop, and I suspect that it will bite into the market shares of both 13 and 15" MBP laptops.::Gatorowl::4.0::July 26, 2011

R2NYUXMOA3EED2::LOVE LOVE LOVE::I don't know what I ever did without this. I was a PC person before, and even if this is the old version, I see no reason to upgrade for quite some time. It's so light, it's so fast, and I never used the disk drive on my old computer anyway so I don't miss it at all. I got it used on here for MUCH less than original cost and I want to just hug it everyday.Tablets work seamlessly with a mac, even off-brand non-wacoms (I have a monoprice and a huiron, both highly recommended as well).I'd recommend getting an external hard drive and/or passport and keeping the majority of your files on there, and getting a case for this laptop that will have a compartment for the drive to go as well. I keep very little on the computer itself and it prevents the notorious issue of it overheating or running itself ragged. A nearly empty SSD is so fast, and the externals are easy to load up.If you don't want to bring your hard drive around, you can also take advantage of any number of cloud storage systems out there.::Sugarbee::5.0::February 11, 2014

The computer is fast, light, great battery life and is an overall beautiful machine. I cannot say enough on how Apple has changed mine and my families life but they have for the better. They are always made really well and built to last and you may pay a bit more but is definitely worth it, we were Windows users for a very long time and always seemed to be missing something we found it in Apple.

R3G69Q7RG5NM6C::My first Mac, laptop is perfect, OS leaves some things to be desired::This is my first Mac, I purchased it used in 'Like New' condition from mymacpro. It came in 'Like New' condition and has few if any flaws. Ive used Chrome OS (my favorite non-Windows OS right now), Ubuntu, KDE, Windows 7 and 8, Debian, and finally I bought a Mac to try OSX.I love the laptop itself. It's the pinnacle of premium hardware! Hard metal meets glass and hard plastics. The screen isn't covered in glass, like the Pro, but it isn't very soft so it's a non-issue. Trackpad is unbelievably smooth, the keyboard has just the right feel and isn't too squishy or clicky. Speakers could be louder but for the size of the laptop, they're plenty loud. I LOVE the Magsafe plug. This Macbook Air is the most solidly built laptop I've ever owned.The OS, which based on reputation should be the easiest OS on earth to use...has a big learning curve. Other than minor annoyances, I like it. It's attractive, simple and requires few if any tweaks to be comfortably usable (unlike Windows or Linux which require massive amounts of customization).Note : iPhoto causes this laptop to heat up and the fan to spin at top speed, Ive read this is common because iPhoto is CPU intensive, worthy to note.I'm an Apple convert!::mike::4.0::July 12, 2013
R7U4EFH860N7A::Best laptop LOVE it::I have had about 5 different windows laptops over the years and have always wanted a macbook air. Finally found one here on amazon for $800 and snagged it. It is far and away the best laptop I have ever used. The trackpad alone is worth the purchase. Add in the keyboard, screen and form factor and this thing is a beast. Very fast, have never wished it was faster. Never had a problem. My classmate who sits right next to me has the exact same laptop. He has thrown in now 3 times while he was drunk. The thing took a few dents but it didn't slow it down in the least bit, nothing wrong at all!Pros Everything from the size and weight to the screen resolution to the keys and trackpad. Oh and lets not forget OSX.Cons: The screen color is not as bright or vibrant as the macbook pro, it is noticeable side by side but you only notice when they are next to each other. Also wish it had a glass cover over the LCD screen like the pro.Going price right now for around $750 is a bargain. I bought this about 10 months ago and have used it daily for about 12 hrs a day. (medical school). It hasn't slowed down one bit while the sea of black PC's around me have numerous problems. I have had it for 10 months and the value has only dropped $50! Also apple will usually give you a new 1 year warranty for used purchases from amazon, just shoot them an email and ask.::jallove7::5.0::April 26, 2013
R19CH4L0N7OIV9::First Mac since the Apple IIE - and it's a BIT improved.::Ok, so I know the Apple IIE wasn't a Mac, but it was the last Apple computer I used.  Close enough.  Anyway, I went through 3 Lenovo laptops in successive years; always having random hardware issues with all of them.  Love me some Windows 7, but the hardware was terrible (in my experience).  I stuck with Lenovo only because these were the company laptops and I didn't have any other options...until now.When my job evolved to where I spent most of my time working on the web, I then had a choice of laptops.  I've been a huge fan of the iPhones & my iPad 1, so I thought I'd go for a MacBook Air.So I've had a week of working on this new device, and so far I love it!  Sure, it's not perfect, but I've never enjoyed a laptop more.  The name "Air" certainly matches the design; it is incredibly light, which makes a HUGE difference in workability.  I feel like I can bring this laptop anywhere.  In the past, I never enjoyed lugging around a similarly sized, but 5.5lb Lenovo.  The weight makes all the difference.The Mac OS itself is fine;  it takes some getting used to, but I've picked up on the basic features quick enough.  Eventually I'll learn those mouse gestures!So far the only hiccups I've encountered have been the so-so battery life...and that's probably because I'm comparing this to another popular Apple product, the iPad.  The other issue is that so far I've been unable to print via Google Chrome, but that could very well be an issue on Google's end.  Safari works just fine.In the end, the point of a laptop, is mobility, isn't it?  And for that this MacBook Air gets 5-stars easily.  The screen-size is just right, and the weight is out-a-sight!  Oh man, that was lame. ;-)::Mac Riddel::5.0::December 28, 2011
R1FBHEV4VFZFQN::Love love love it::First Mac computer - absolutely love it.  Super light, brilliant screen, it turns on and off in a flash, battery life is great, etc.  There's a slight learning curve for new mac users, but it's fairly intuitive and after a while you'll never know how you dealt with the annoyances of a PC!::obenation::5.0::December 21, 2011
R2ULH4ERIT93RA::Wow::This computer is the best!  Lite weight and fast and just plain awesome!  Set up was easy, I was able to take my old Mac and this new one and was able to transfer all of my files to the new one!  It was so easy!  Love Apple!::Gun Girl::5.0::December 21, 2011
R14RDWSP5SIFS5::Surprised it doesn't get 5 star!!!::I love it, simply put. Being a 4 month Mac user, this is my first using a Mac and Mac OS, changing from Windows 7. I admit that I am a little bit geek and spent quite some to get exposed to OS Lion. I bet once you got the idea of structural design of the operating system you will never want to go back to windows (I am not saying I hate windows). And what is more is that the word processing tools (iWork suite) for Mac is no inferior to MS office. I spent much less time in learning how to use iWork than Office and even get confused, when historical reasons is temporarily out of my mind, why today's PC market share is so in favor of Microsoft.If you have long been considering switching to a MacBook but deterred by the fact that you might not be used to it's OS, it's now your time to make up your mind at least to get this MacBook Air a try in an Apple Store.::Qin::5.0::December 7, 2011

R1YAZ0ZSSKTFG2::Best ever, but...::Everything about this computer is fantastic, except for the Thunderbolt port.Thunderbolt is utterly useless, unless you plan on buying a $1,000 drive array, or a $1,000 monitor.  There is no firewire port, and most of us have firewire peripherals - external drives, video cameras, music recording interfaces.  And it's nearly 2012, and NOBODY makes a Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter yet.The Thunderbolt port is nice for someday in the future, but without a FireWire port, Thunderbolt is just a waste of space on this machine.This is my 6th Mac.  It's fantastic - light, fast, powerful, and it's still worth four stars.  But Apple really screwed up by dropping FireWire in favor of a connection that is useless now, and will be for the foreseeable future.::Foodie::4.0::November 23, 2011

RCU7NIQHX5XQE::Nice, but networking and printer issues::Great little laptop, really like the multi touch. Garage Band is cool and fun to play with. But:Does not handle WEP encryption well. So while you might run WPA at home, if you are at a hotspot running WEP, good luck. Even running WPA on my 802.11G router I notice irregular performance: ping will return 3,1,6,3,129,5,34,45,2,3MS with an occasional request timed out. My work Dell running XP will yield consistent replies <1MS. Something's not right there.Also, I have an older Canon MF1450 printer / scanner / fax and there are no drivers that work for it, at least not yet. It will see the printer, print to it, then it says "printer paused". So as of now I can't print from this thing. Very annoying.I am hoping these issues can be resolved with an OSX update. As of now, I am underwhelmed by the "Apple Experience". I've done more head scratching with this than with any other windows or linux box I've built. Maybe if you buy a new Apple AirPort router and Apple approved printer with your new Mac, and use it while eating applesauce with Apple compliant utensils, everything will "just work". However, I would expect better backward compatibility from a $1,300 laptop.I'm thinking maybe I should have waited for the Acer 128GB flash ultrabook? W7 is a pretty nice OS, too. If any Apple fans out there can set me straight, go for it. Any help I can get to bring the utility of this thing up to the price I paid will be much appreciated.::Rob Guffanti::3.0::January 14, 2012
R2CX6Z1NHDF6JD::Wow such a difference.::I just got it and even though I haven't used any Mac's before I love almost everything about it. Sleek design. Lightweight. Backlit keyboard. Fast i5 with 4GB of ram. Blazing fast SSD and minimal loading times for everything. Super high dpi, contrast, backlight screen.I'm a Computer Science major and I do have to spend a lot of time outside of my home coding group projects, and I absolutely adore my new macbook air and how much lighter and faster it is than my previous P8400 4GB Ram, 1GB M9600 Nvidia video Asus X83VM-X1 HDD laptop. It is so much more that any other windows laptop that I had chance to use having less than half the battery endurance. Simply said it is different in many ways. Different being mostly good (aside from the different right click on the touchpad that takes time to get used to).Strongly recommend this item to the many computer science majors out there. And one more thing, if you lack Windows, just put on a virtual machine using a virtualBox, vmware (the free version), or some other virtualization software available out there and use it when you need it. To my experience it is faster even when you dedicate 2.5GB of ram to it and use the SSD speedup to compensate most of the HDD thrashing.And yes I know $1240 (for 128GB i5) is more than if you buy 2 Windows based laptops, but if you can afford yourself to spend it and not regret it like if you would when buying a Windows based one when every time you use your not so well designed, awkward controlled(Mac is so much more natural in it's UI), slow (using HDD most of the time on a slower operating system), heavy, and not personalized windows based laptop.::Georgiy Chigrichenko::5.0::November 11, 2011
R7X3H8EPR8IK3::best notebook until now::I was hesitating before buying the MBA 13 version a few weeks and until now i think it was a good decision to buy this.  I have used iphone4 , a  macbook pro 17 as my basic computer and an iPad, and still couldn't solve the problem of traveling well. On the IPAD it is  simply impossible to work , it doesn't have a file management system, no ports etc. And i have good eyes so i can do the same things on my phone so i found it is not necessary to carry. My macbook pro is more than 3 kg.I chose the MBA 13 and not the 11 because the more SSD disk  though you can configure a 11 model with 256 as well  and the bigger screen, sd card slot. 30 grams difference in weight is nothing and for a longer use it is a big difference the bigger screen size. So if the money difference doesn't found for you i would definitely go with the 13 modell, that is is sure you won't regret that . If you get the 11 model what i did with my previous sony vaio for the whole time i had the feeling i should have chosen the bigger model.PROS :Fantastic feeling in your hand , a real piece of art .Very fast , much faster than my macbook pro 17 form mid 2009.Very good keyboard , very easy and fast to type on it .Excelent battery life.Good for ultraportable and for a basic use as well , multipurpose.SD card slot is very useful to download photos, videos or simply for storage .2 usb ports can be useful instead of the one one the 11 modelexcellent voice quality and power  when listening to musicCOINS:the built in mike  could be in a better place to record you louderthe resolution of the screen could be better, it is slightly less than the 11 inch model. Developers still couldn't solve it on any 13  screen model though this size is the good one if you want to carry and use for basic a modell.Summing it up if you have the budget and want to buy a notebook now , this is the choice. An ihpne and this and you are solved , you don't need anything else . For more storage buy a timemaschine or an external disk, and use your old monitor or tv if for some reason you need a bigger screen for a task. Extremely fast machine.

R2QNRPNXIHKALO::MBA 13 inch i5 128gb is made for starcraft 2 on the go!::I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about switching over to mac after so many years of windows but decided to make that leap finally due to frustrations on the windows platform, and let me say, I am in love. :)I won't go into details about the architecture of the mba 13 cuz of the numerous reviews.I did a lot of research trying to figure out if this laptop can run starcraft 2 comfortably (only game I really play AND need to play it on the go!) and let me say this baby can run starcraft 2 comfortably!I have the settings at just a little below medium (with a few options taken off) and it still looks beautiful and it is able to run at 4v4 full screen online with almost no lag, in fact I don't even notice it while playing it! the loadtimes are low and I always end up waiting on other ppl to load the game up.The only problem is the heating. The top left corner of the laptop heats up and the fan goes crazy. Baseline temps run at 45C and after running starcraft2 or skype with video or youtube, temps will run up to 92C! the fan will go from baseline 2000rpms to 6500rpms.Of note, I am still trying to get used to the osx system. The iphoto, itunes and the way they take control of everything and I "lose" sense of where they are at, but you can change your options to create the libraries accordingly without changing the original folders of the files.If you have any questions wrt starcraft2 I will try to answer. afterall..

R2WL38G0SK2J63::Converted Skeptic - Not - Please read update::Please read this entire review.  I have updated it as of March 2013.  I have left my original review in place so the reader can see how my views have changed from the original review date.***I bought a basic MacBook Air over one year ago.  I had never owned a Mac and the purchase price was high, so I was skeptical about what I was getting.  I also disliked the keyboard (still do) but went ahead because of the constant problems I was having with PCs.  I had spent a hundred dollars ridding the PC of virus problems - again - just prior to buying this MacBook Air, and that was while I was running anti-virus and anti-almost everything else (McAfee) software.  And that software was costing me money every year.  EVERY PC I have ever owned has slowed down over time, usually within six months,  and that includes desktops as well as laptops.  I was fed up with the PC problems and hidden cost so I bought this MacBook Air - and held my breath.I have let the breath go.  After over one year of operation this computer still runs fine.  It is just as fast as it ever was and I have never had a slow down even though I surf the net a lot and shop on Amazon constantly.  It runs off wifi with no problems and I have connected a Logitech keyboard to it without problems.  Plus, there are a ton of applications with reasonable prices.And I have never bought or ran an anti-virus program on this machine; thus, saving me the cost to clean up the computer every few months and paying for anti-virus software every year.  These cost savings add up, and I think I am saving money over the "cheaper" PC.My wife still uses a PC, but she is starting to think about an Apple.  The cost is hampering her; however, as the PC slows down and a decisions nears to clean it up plus pay another year of anti-virus, or buy something else, she is leaning toward the Apple.  Maybe by Christmas 2012 she will come around and give me a way to buy a present without a lot of thinking.***Update March 2013I have previously reviewed my Apple computers (see above - a laptop and a desktop).  I have written many reviews, but Amazon does not let me search my own reviews by subject to find the review to update it, so I am stuck. I have owned my Apple Macbook Air for a little less than 2 years and the desktop for one year (approximate).My most significant complaint is the exceptionally poor customer service. Even a slight problem can result in infuriating hassles trying to reach Apple or otherwise solve the glitches on line. APPLE GOES TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PREVENT YOU FROM REACHING A HUMAN. Worse, the on line "solutions" are ridiculous, failing to solve even the most common problems. My closest Apple store is in Reno, Nevada about 50 miles away; however, you cannot reach a person at the store by phone. You only get a recording giving directions to the store. This is a specialized Apple Store, not a secondary retailer like Best Buy. Another complete block to human contact.The machines run decently, have few virus problems, and the display is very good. However, they DO suffer from slowdowns over time. When I first bought my Apple laptop it came on and ran instantly - and I mean instantly. Now it takes up to a minute or more to start up. I am having a similar experience with my desktop machine, although the start up for the desktop was never close to instant.Why it is running slower and slower is hard to say. Virus scans and multiple runs of Apple Disk Doctor and disk verifications here at home turn up nothing. I have also erased data on and highly restricted access to Flash programs, among other things. I have updated the operating system with each new update: from Snow Leopard, to Lion, to Mountain Lion. The hard drives on my machines are less than 10 percent full. I can only report that the performance of these machines deteriorates significantly over time.The mere fact that Apple blocks access to human beings is enough to downgrade my rating significantly. The real problem is the people running Apple, they simply have no customer awareness. In addition, the free support for their machine is short and I have found the owners of the local Apple stores an unforgiving lot - even when you purchased the machine from them.The next problem, and this is a HUGE problem, is the availability of programs, and the functioning of programs that are offered. The number of excellent programs available for PC platforms is amazing. They dwarf the number of programs existing for Apple. This especially true in games. The number of first-rate games obtainable for the PC platform is at least triple the availability for Apple. In addition, many of the programs that are available for Apple from outside vendors run poorly. One example of this is the Dragon speech dictation program, which runs very poorly on Apple but very well on PC platforms. There are literally dozens of other examples. Read the software reviews here on Amazon.Another complaint is the worthless Apple keyboard. I have arthritis and using the keyboard is difficult. Aftermarket keyboards do work; however, Apple has several specialized keys not duplicated on aftermarket keyboards. These same keyboards, although excellent in design, exhibit odd anomalies commonly associated with all aftermarket non-Apple products. Of course, "fixing" a laptop keyboard isn't possible. One can plug in another keyboard but that harms the portability of the machine, a key reason to buy a laptop. When I say the keyboard is bad I mean worthless. The keyboard on the machine is nearly unusable for me because of my arthritis. I use an Adesso curved keyboard on my desktop and it works pretty well.After two years of experience with an Apple laptop (and desktop), I cannot recommend Apple. The actual computer itself, and the display, are above standard, and at the price charged they should be; however, everything else is below acceptable standards. For all the virus problems with PC machines, and the necessity to "clear out" the junk accumulating within the programs over time, the PCs run just as fast, cost much less money to buy, have far far more programs available for them, run after market add-ons like keyboards, game controllers, et al, without a glitch, and new programs, products, and games coming out are all written for the PC Platform, not the Apple.And yes I have read all the glowing reviews. I wrote one of them myself after owning the laptop for about six months and I was dumb enough to buy a desktop about a year later; however, time has changed my mind. I am buying my wife a new computer for Christmas, and it will be a PC based platform (Toshiba). She has used PCs for years, and even after my glowing reviews of Apple and my second purchase she would not abandon her old old PC. Guess what? She was right. For all its "problems" the PC platform, and the companies selling the PC platform, have a strong customer orientation that Apple does not have. If you want a company to put YOU first and a machine that runs everything out there, buy a PC.AD2::Alan Dale Daniel::1.0::March 1, 2012
R9ELFYRFC4GD3::The screen is waaaaaay too fragile - do not buy this laptop!::I've purchased two 13" Macbook Airs and thought they were quite well made, which they largely are, except the screen which is incredibly fragile. On my first flight with a MBA, I had a set of earbuds resting on the keyboard and gently closed the lid when I picked up my laptop to get up and the screen immediately cracked. The small crack soon spread throughout the entire screen.When I took it to the Apple store in Bellevue, WA they said the MBA is very durable in general but admitted that the screen is its main weak point and it tends to shatter easily because the glass is incredibly thin. They would not replace my screen despite admitting that it is a design flaw and wanted $450 to repair it. My friends with older Macbook Pros that are beat to heck still work fine, I baby the heck out of my Air and the screen shatters - it wasn't dropped, it wasn't hit, it wasn't abused. I would not buy this laptop for any students, young people, travelers, business users, etc. My iPhones and iPads have been well built, but the Air is not the same level of quality.It is unacceptable for a laptop to be this delicate, none of my previous Thinkpads would have been damaged from this.Apple needs to fix this serious design flaw in their current generation of Macbook Airs.Legendary customer service and quality? Yeah right, what a joke... :-/::Matt S "Matt S"::1.0::February 16, 2012
R2GN2DB6HUULLM::Hook Line and Sinker::It started several years ago when I received an ipod nano from the wife for Christmas.  I always wondered what the buzz about Apple products.  Well..a nano, 2 apple tv's, 2 iPhones, Airport Extreme router, Airport Express, ipod touch and now a macbook air, I can tell you I will never go back to a pc.  This computer is by far the best I have ever owned or even used.  Very sleek, blazing fast and compact.  Not to mention it just works!..No freezing programs error messages etc.  I know apple products are expensive but in the long run its well worth it.  I can't wait to start using this laptop for traveling.  I can now be that "cool guy" I always envied at the coffee shop with the cool looking Mac!::Art Vandelay::5.0::March 1, 2012
R1WE65BX41M5FQ::Macbook Air - new Mac user - very very pleased indeed::I got the i7 256G 13" Air.  I am totally new to Mac after being PC user for past 20 years.  I am an engineer, so always foolishly thought I can't possibly get by with a Mac (duh).  Anyway, I made the switch after so many recent problems with our new laptop at home and my work laptop provided by my employer.  First, the learning curve is there, but nothing that you can't get through after some intensive use.  I have been using my Air daily and intensively for two months without a single crash - I repeat, not a single crash.  The display is great, the speed is phenomenal due to the SSD, I open multiple applications with zero crashes.  I read Kindle books on it, I do my investing online with it, I run huge spreadsheets on it, I read huge PDF files with it, I am writing a book on it, and everything just works.  I am using MS Office for Mac and that has been very, very stable to use.  BTW:  I also got the Thunderbolt display with wireless keyboard and trackpad.  It is seamless - just one cable and voila, I have a 27" display and all my peripherals hooked up to it.  The Air does not even flinch and handles the 27" display flawlessly.  This is especially useful for viewing large spreadsheets, editing video, and things of that nature.Battery life is OK, not great, however.  I could get 7 hours on very low screen brightness doing nothing but word processing, but anything like watching a video will burn up the battery pretty quick.  But the trade off for functionality and speed in a 3 pound wonder is well worth it.  I live my life out of my Air and I barely notice it is there - it is a tool that just works.  There are some tradeoffs you need to deal with in switching to Mac from PC - like webmail through Exchange is much more full-featured in Explorer than through Safari, some flash applications do not work, and a few minor nits.  I love, love the backlit keyboard - just makes sense!  The aluminum case is the bomb - I mean, wow, what nicely assembled product.  No creaks, no flexing, it just feels great in the hand.  The computer restarts from cold in about 15 seconds and wakes from sleep mode in the time it takes to raise the lid.  This means instant productivity.  I only reboot it to accept software updates when needed, otherwise it is always on and I never shut down my applications - the F3 key is awesome to quickly navigate open apps.  Did I mention it is fast, I mean, everything happens nearly instantly.  I can open and view a research-grade 150 page PDF file loaded with spreadsheets, graphs, and images and it just opens it up instantly with zero lag when scrolling from beginning to end.  The trackpad is AMAZING - scrolling an resizing webpages and PDF files is just a great experience (too bad the resize does not work with MS Office for Mac).Why will I never buy a PC again?  Well, after a few days of ownership my Air and Time Capsule crashed and totally locked each other up.  I was really, really mad.  I took it all back to the Apple Store - they said they didn't want to waste my time trying to figure anything out and offered me all brand new hardware on the spot with a full month to decide if I want to still stay with Mac.  So I went home with another brand new Air and a new Time Capsule and everything has worked flawlessly since.  SO, in a word, customer service when you need it is where it is at.  That is why, BTW, I have driven Lexus the past few years - they also know what customer service is all about, at least that has been my good experience.I am pleased, pleased, pleased with my Macbook Air and recommend it without reservation.  If you are new to Mac, do not be afraid, just tell yourself you will have to go through a learning curve and in a few weeks you should be good to go and probably will never look back.  I know nothing about playing games on the Mac vs. PC because I am not a gamer, so no advice on that.Update:  One more thing I would like to add is how I went about my final decision to switch to Apple?  I really wanted to avoid Mac, and tried to convince myself to get another pc - mostly because of lack of experience with Apple (we do have an iPad however, which we also love).  I spent a lot of time between Apple Store and big box stores comparing laptops.  Some big box stores also carry both, so it was easy to compare.  What did I find?  Well, there were maybe 25 pc's on display and I'll bet that 50% of them were locked up with the blue screen of death.  None of the track pads worked consistently on any of them - I tried Vaio and Asus (they have their version of the Air) and it was riddled with operating problems.  In contrast, I never came across an Apple Macbook, Air, or iMac that was not running.  In fact, they all run exactly the same.  Finally, I talked to a few of the techs in the big box stores - they all said they spend each morning trouble-shooting all the crashed pc's, but the Apple products run for months without issues.  I must say my iPad has never had a problem either.  So, that how I made my ultimate decision to switch to Apple.  For the kinds of things I do (mostly office type stuff) I could not tell the difference between the Air and the Pro - so I went for portability, and with the Thunderbolt display it is almost an iMac!Follow-up:  Now in my 15th month of ownership, I must say the Macbook Air continues to impress!  In general, this computer has been "on" since I bought it and has never crashed or hung-up.  I only have rebooted for system updates, speaking of which, are seamless every time.  It has never ever crashed.  Let me repeat that - EVER!  Now that is amazing.  My wife has since gotten an identical Macbook Air that we bought as a refurb through Apple store.  I use this laptop every day and it travels with me every day.  I also switched to a Macbook Pro at work, the wife and I both have iphone 5, and our 8 year old daughter has an ipod 4thG.  None of these devices has ever crashed.  This is so amazing to me after so many years of pc nonsense.  Needless to say, I am now a bonafide Apple nut!  The new Macbook Pro with Retina is the bomb, but for routine use like email, spreadsheets, powerpoint, web, photos, video chat, etc. you can't beat the MBA for portability and lightweight.  As a side note, we are having some problems with the hard drive on our time capsule router, but that is under warranty, fully realizing that any hard drive running continuously is prone to failure.  Solid state all the way baby!  Apple rocks.  Period.::MKOW::5.0::February 24, 2012
R6IMCHX1JPYSO::mac air 13::Excellent piece of hardware, fast start up, good battery life, mine went up to 5 hours with mediumusage like browsing and occasional you tube videos. This laptop is very portable and lightweight.But the only issue I had is the screen size, this 13 inch screen was a deal breaker for me,using this for more than 2 hours causes my eyes to strain, even changing fonts did not help much.Also working through remote connection to desktops is almost impossible due to this small screen size.If apple comes up with a 15 inch screen for air next year I might go for that.So this one is going back as I don't want another show piece sitting beside the ipad doing nothing.::Anik::4.0::December 14, 2011
RDWJ3RKOUL21G::Macbook Air 2011: Great value, and powerful ultraportable.::PROs:- The Macbook Air 2011 equipped with a powerful Intel SB ULV processor, and a Samsung SSD is blazing fast for everyday and office usage. The computer boots in 14 seconds and shuts down in 4, programs open instantly, and the entire feel is extremely smooth.- Intel HD 3000 Graphics fare okay in games; they seem to handle Valve games (even the newest ones such as Portal 2 and HL2E2) well. Other games can be played on native resolution at medium settings.- The battery life at 50% and light-medium usage is 7 hours, but it can be easily extended to 8+ hours by turning down the brightness. At maximum brightness and medium usage, the battery life is 5:30 minutes.- Also to mention is the absolutely dazzling design; the device is remarkably thin and light; and it looks beautiful and sturdy at the same time. It's important to note that the wifi problem has been fixed with the new Mac update (10.7.2).- The Macbook Air fares well versus similar competitors; it is actually priced lower than most of its competitors (except the Lenovo Ultrabook - which really does not offer the same level of performance and design).Con:- When using the laptop in an intensive task it does become noticeably hot and noisy - nothing extreme, but definitely noticeable.I have been using the laptop for nearly 3 months now, and I have to say that I am absolutely impressed, and recommend it greatly over any of its competitors for anyone looking for a powerful ultra-portable laptop. Also to note that while this was my first Mac, it took little time to become used to it.::Al G::5.0::October 20, 2011
R254TJDW6W0XOK::the perfect laptop::it's super thin & light and beautiful. i only wish it was cheaper.the keyboard does feel very shallow, so it's harder to type than a macbook pro. the camera isn'y hd because the display is too thin to fit an hd cam. the battery only last about 5hrs of normal use which isn't bad but not stellar either. my x220 lasts 9hrs easily.::M.

R3P4XWJSGZ7IOB::Solid quality, great deal on Amazon::Have used 2011 13" Macbook Air w/ 128GB flash drive for about 5 weeks now, very pleased with product quality. Amazon's shipment and service top-notch per usual. The Macbook Air started to consume more battery when I upgraded to Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion), so owner beware. Definitely a software-related glitch, nothing to do with Amazon. Also, I've had difficulty with the Macbook Air reconnecting to the same wi-fi network when I wake it up from sleep mode when at work - it seems as though the MBA has trouble when it detects more than one network that you've connected to in the same area, it doesn't automatically re-connect in this instance.Otherwise, the portability and quality of this laptop can't be beat.::lazeekat::4.0::October 12, 2012
RR8S7TDXECNGX::magic laptop::its your even considering it, do not pass on this item. i just upgraded from a macbook pro 13" 2011 and the reflective screenwas unforgivable.all the extra power and ram upgrades could change the fact that I got a headache after 2 hours of use of the reflective 2011macbook pros.This laptop is a joy, if macbook air ever goes retina, ill be finding a way to get one with this gorgeous matt finish.with 10.8.2, its the most stable this macbook air has run, utter joy to work long hours on with a true warm monitor withnative 1400 x 900 resolution, no massive scrolling to read articles or resizing windows.I'm an engineer and Virtualization runs so fast, parallels running windows 7 x64 on this thing makes my job a joy.though i dont like having tokeep dvd/rw and gb network cable usb adapter handy, its worth the option when i need to slim down.For me itsTHE best balance of a powerful yet lightweight device surpassing the ipad 3 which i also have and use much less.::Joseph::5.0::October 2, 2012
R1M17GZFXDG79G::Most beautiful notebook ever.::Obviously this thing is beautiful.  It's aluminum body is absolutely gorgeous.  The SSD is incredible.

RUAX3MHT17H94::The Best of the Best::Others have tried to copy the MacBook Air, but the Air still holds its own on the top.  I tried the 11" and 13" before I bought the 13".The keyboard is smaller than some of the imitators, but works with my rather large hands.  The screen size is large compared to the size of the unit.The touch pad and the thunderbolt connection make this unit especially unique.  I thought I might need a mouse, but with the touchpad controls it is not needed.The single-finger, double-finger, and triple-finger commands are all intuitive and smooth as silk.  The MacBook Air is just what I needed for my travel computer.::Elwood D. Baas "woody"::5.0::July 4, 2012
R17ZU6L3T0KR3N::Best Ultraportable out there IMO::Pros:-The laptop is blazing fast. Maybe because of i5 + SSD-Virtually unlimited RAM(look up SSD and RAM relationship if you want to know more). I have safari(8 tabs), chrome(12 tabs), Rosetta Stone, word, excel, ppt, and itunes all  running at the same time and still no performance lag. I haven't turned off my computer in 44 days!!-Lightweight. I have it in my backpack at all times and barely feel it.-Battery life - if you turn off keyboard lights and dim the brightness to about 30% then should get 6-7 hours of "browsing"-Charger is really fun sized and easy to carry as well.- Compatible with other OS - I have OSX Lion, Windows 7 and Ubuntu installed right now. All 3 work great.-Display - the resolution on it is amazing and it can get really bright if you're outdoors.-Keyboard - the keys on this thing are amazing. I look forward to typing on it!!Cons:Had to scratch my head to find any.-Camera could be better resolution-Price ( maybe not because its well worth it)::Raj::5.0::June 28, 2012
R5QYZUAHRGZR8::Macbook Air::I have recently bought this computer because I needed something that I could carry around and do my homework on. I love that this computer is very light and small, but is also very durable. When I bought it, I was a little nervous that it would break easily, but that is not the case. The computer starts up and shuts down very fast. This is nice because I am an inpatient person. The last computer I had did not have a built-in microphone and camera. I like this feature very much because I use Skype a lot to meet with groups for my classes. The one thing that I don't like is that it doesn't have a cd drive on the side. Overall this is a great computer and has done everything that I expected it too.::Abby::5.0::June 21, 2012
R3AP89SM2P2YTW::For Windows fans, this is perfect for you...!::I'm not a big fan of Apple's Macintosh. However, I am a big fan of their products. What I like mostly about my Macbook Air is the awesome portability, the great battery life (3 and a half hours at least) and the great quality. I installed Windows 7 on it the first day I got it using Bootcamp software that comes with the Macintosh. Windows is fully supported ! It functions like it would on any Sony, Toshiba or HP laptop, if not better. I have had this laptop for over 3 months now and have been using Windows 7 on it the whole time. I can tell you with out a doubt, this is the best laptop out their, whether you're a Mac user or a PC fan.::Naif::5.0::June 15, 2012
R1W0Q8BMOUWROT::Nice powerfull::It is really nice, As an windows pc user I thought it would be hard at the beginning but not. It is very easy to adapt yourself to Mac. Mac Air is very light and powerful. After getting my Mac I download Any Video converter which I use on windows as well. I compare to convert same video to Mpeg4, windows gave me 12 hours but Mac 35 minutes. What Mac gives on its specs you are going to have. After getting used to use you will get more.::Ayhan::5.0::June 5, 2012
RU8U879IV3PT0::An Apple a Day::Finally, after years and years of frustration with PC's I broke down and bought a Mac....the intuitive nature of what Apple offers is nothing short of incredible.  The Macbook Air (we purchased two) came quickly using Amazon Prime, I saved $100 each by buying through Amazon and of course also enjoyed the 7% sales tax savings.  The set-up only took minutes and the beauty is that this machine boots up and is ready to rock in seconds instead of minutes...well worth every dime.  We also purchased covers (skins) and keyboard covers to protect our investment.::PokeyJoe::5.0::February 23, 2012
RUELQURWRTY3K::so addicted::i had the first macbook air and got this newer one a year later for my dad. LOVE the lighted keyboard and extra memory, and it seems to have less of the "spinning wheel of death" issue than the macbook pros we use at work. my dad is having a little difficulty getting used to the apple platform, having been a lifelong pc user (and not overly adept at that), but the search function and google are great for figuring out how to do something that normally takes a right-click on a pc.mostly, i just love being able to tote my computer up and down stairs without issue :)::C. Milhorn "Mommy2b"::5.0::January 28, 2012
R1KQGXCZCEQILZ::5 stars don't do this machine justice::There are many reviews for the macbook air itself available here and on the internet in general, so I will not repeat the same thing over and over again beyond saying that I LOVE IT! I have been using windows since Win 3.10 and DOS before that but OSX is just awesome. I have no issues with Win7 and I will most likely install it as a second OS but so far I am having a blast exploring OSX.That being said, if you're thinking of getting a macbook from amazon, please look into the amazon warehouse deals! Yes it is technically not new but rather an open box deal BUT The computer I got was in original packaging with all of the plastic on the computer, screen etc in place. The battery had 1 cycle on it and Apple reset the warranty to reflect my purchase date so I get a full 1 year warranty as if I bought a new machine from them.I doubt you will find a 256gb i5 macbook air from anyone else in this condition for less than 1300 (which is what I paid for it). Hint: pay using a chase freedom card for an additional 5% cash back (another $65 discount).Nothing but love for amazon! You're awesome!::Y. Mordkovich::5.0::January 28, 2012

R5A7B13ADI5AS::Excellent!::Now after getting used to the 13" Mac Air after years of PC, I have to say the Air is darn near perfect. No problems what so ever. It's light, quick, functional and very portable. I love the track pad. It's the first laptop where I don't feel the need for a mouse. Excellent wifi reception. I chose the Air over Ultrabooks because the Air is ahead of the curve with years of honing the product. And Amazon's delivery was wonderfully speedy.::otto::5.0::January 21, 2012
R3U2L1P2JSRZFI::Awesome::I've had my Macbook Air for almost two (2) months now and absolutely LOVE it!!  At first it took a little getting use to however, all is good now.  I just recently had to use my sisters Dell the other day and it was like using something foreign!!  I had such a problem navigating and clicking on items.  The "Track Pad" is such an amazing feature on the Mac.As far as ordering from Amazon, the process was easy and fast! I ordered and had it shipped overnight with no problems at all.I would suggest buying the "SquareTrade" warranty instead of the Apple Warranty that is recommended.  SquareTrade is for three (3) years and covers ANYTHING that goes wrong with computer, even drops and spills.Hope you enjoy your Macbook Air as much as I do!!!::Sunshinelover::5.0::January 12, 2012
RWN8LJEKADQ44::Great laptop::I'm so glad I opted for the 13 inch Air - I think the 11 inch model would have been a mistake.  This is my first Mac laptop and it's wonderful.::brianc-sf::5.0::January 8, 2012
R13SZWR0B5IYH3::Simply Amazing!::It's all been covered before in the other reviews. Less than 3lbs; reboots in like 15 seconds; great screen; state of the art trackpad(mouse gestures); shockingly good sound. So much faster than my 2 year old $3000 laptop it still boggles my mind even a month later. I love this laptop. I can walk around the house with it - holding it with two fingers.The major speed difference is likely all because of the SSD drive - I'll never go back - all SSD drives from now on. It's worth the extra price.::Joel Dauteuil::5.0::January 6, 2012
R1122XUZ3GQADY::Loving my Mac::The Macbook air is the first Mac I've ever owned, and I don't want to switch back to a pc. The OS is simple, fast, and incredibly chipper. The SSD is so fast I was AMAZED! It can play high-end 3D games (at expense of battery life) and run anything quite fast. Don't let the high price turn you off, this is an EXCELLENT computer.::William R. Schlitz "W. Schlitz"::5.0::December 26, 2011
RU92C018VWVI::Fantastic laptop::I was torn between a Macbook Pro and Macbook Air 13.3 and decided to go for the Air because of the form factor and SSD. I don't regret my decision. It is very powerful and snappy. I use it for some photo post processing work, which can be demanding depending on file size and effects used. I had no problems so far. I am sure a Mac Pro would be faster in handling such cases but the MacBook Ait 13.3 i5 isn't a slouch either. Absolutely a joy to use.Previous reviews stated problems with wi-fi stability. I have experienced none of them. The wi-fi connectivity is stable.::Ali Boyacioglu::5.0::December 4, 2011
RL40KV3IATS6P::Mac Love!::Super computer and light as a feather.  Finally something I can really carry with full functionality!!  My friends recommended it, and they were so right.  I walk around the room with it and just plop down wherever I like.::Ponygirl::5.0::November 22, 2011
R20AWQL3S9UF7C::Great Porability, Reservations Not Needed::When first considering the Macbook Air i did have a few concerns regarding the size, lack of features, shorter battery life, etc.  Gladly, none of these reservations i had were true.  The size of the screen is perfect and they keyboard remains large enough for even someone like me (6'3" with larger hands).  I was also hesitant because of the lack of disc drive, no HDMI, etc, but all of these downfalls are compensated with another alternative.  Remote disc drive sharing is a great feature if it ever required you download a disc and the new thunderbolt port offers flexibility with DVI, VGA, HDMI and many other adapters that connect through this port.  On the issue of battery life, this new generation of Air's offers increased battery life which has proven itself on long car rides and plane trips.::Ryan Donaldson::4.0::November 7, 2011
R22O04X5Q93VP::Amazing piece of design and technology BUT::My first MAC ever, love it the design and the simplicity to use the trackpad and all.There is thousands of review hence won't go through everything.If you are a PC user, you will have a bit of trouble for a week, no more.It looks much more stable and reliable than a PC....it is very fast.BUT it is a shame that video can't be played out of the box, I had to install plugin to play .avi!?!?!Something called perian...Even after that, some video has trouble with sound...Same stuff for the hard rive and usb key, for writing on NTFS volume you need to download some program me, you may have to pay for it!!!And to transfer something from usb key it takes ages!Problem of compatibility with some stuff like my harmony remote, it is not recognized by the mac!::Nono::4.0::October 29, 2011
RPP1GJG073WVJ::not as good as it looks::update 2/4/2013.  The battery performance is really poor. Today, i charged it to 100%, used it for about 30 minutes and then let it sleep for three hours.  After using it for another ~ 30 minutes it died.  I only surfed websites, no video or graphic intensive sites were visited. Brightness was set to ~ 70% and keypad backlit was on.  The video card performance is again quite inadequate. other than those issues, no breakdowns or problems.**************************************************My wife gave me a 13 inch Mac air a month ago.  After playing with it for a month, i have to say, it is a good machine with lots of shortcomings.  To use a car analogy, i would compare it to the Honda S2000; lots of fun, reliable, beautiful piece of sculpture,  but a bit low on oomph.I will quickly summarize the pro's and con's.Pro-1.  Slick designSturdy construction2.  Light weight3.  Speedy processor for light duty work4.  Intuitive integration of software.5.  Keyboard with back lighting6.  Still the best ultrabook available, but that is about to change in less than a year with several new entries into the segment.7.  Apps available.8.  Individual keys for volume and brightness control.  This allow simple and quick changes.9.  Probably the best and most important feature of the laptop is the bright and high resolution screen.  It makes reading 10X easier and more comfortable.10. Stable OS11. Supposedly pretty much virus free. Unfortunately, i can't say the same with window systems.12. No moving parts to break down except the cooling fan which comes on only rarely.13. Trackpad- more useful than just the good old track pads, but function is a bit unreliable and takes some training.Cons-1.  Battery life is no where close to the claimed > 7 hours, unless you turn off Wifi, set at very dim level and do not run video. For routine use, 3 hours is more like it.2.  The fonts are small and not always easy to increase in size. somewhat limited customization options.3.  Slow video processor.  Most Youtube or internet video will play fine, but some will not play well or at all.  I have compared it side by side with my HP Envy and the Mac appears disabled compared to the Envy. Very limited graphic memory and not upgradable.4.  Keyboard feels flimsy.  This is subjective, but i feel that the HP envy keypads provide more feedback..6.  High initial cost of entry.7.  Mac OS- this is subjective and controversial obviously, but i find Window 7 easier to use with more customization options.8.  Windows 7 still by far has more compatible accessories and software. There are software that allow dual OS or cross compatibility, but most of them will slow down your computer and they are not necessarily cheap.9.  No USB 3.010. The power off button is one of the keys on the keyboard next to Delete and Volume control which means inadvertent power off is not infrequent unless you pay attention to it.11. Unreliable trackpad-  beautiful engineering when it works, but is often unreliable and inconsistent.  I use my good old mouse every chance i can get.To summarize, it is probably still the best Ultrabook available, but probably not for long. You will like it if you absolutely have to have a Mac ultrabook or you cannot wait another 6 months for better competing models from the PC camp.  If don't care for the Mac OS and you can wait for another few months, then i would go for Window 8 Ultrabooks which will likely be available sometime next year. Better yet, if you don't really need an ultrabook, get a real computer.::neutrino::3.0::December 21, 2011
RRB65QN98AQ4N::Latest release does reinvent the notebook for me at least::Since 2005 I've schlepped a Dell laptop around because that is what my company gives me.  Still running XP, heavy, slowing down already after 6 months.  I usually am ready for a trade up after 2-3 years.  Cue Reality Distortion Field - I'm going to work for another group and can actually use a Mac.  As long as it has Office, they don't care.  They support iOS devices!  Egads....OK - let's attack hardware here and the actual machine itself.  Design - it's gorgeous.  Solid as.....well, aluminium and glass with a backlit keyboard (thank you, thank you, thank you) and a great screen compared to what I've been using.  New CPU & existing SSD setup - powers through all my mainstream and relatively lightweight computing needs without breaking a sweat.  Haven't tried gaming on it, probably never will.  Office, power points, email, web surfing, HD video, blah, blah, blah.  Battery life - has been excellent for me so far.  Would say I'm hitting the 7 hours advertised and that's with a reasonable screen brightness, etc.  Keyboard - full size, types great.  Some have griped that it feels 'shallow' with limited travel.  Given the ridicuously thin depth of the case, I'd say they did a decent job.  But yes, I've noticed it a little.  Trackpads - if you look at my reviews you'll see that I HATE them.  Let me grab a cold glass of Apple Kool-Aid here and just say it.  I like this trackpad.  It's big and the glass is perfect in feel and friction and the gestures actually work well.  So now I don't have to carry a travel mouse around.  The traveler's creed - carry less, go lighter and simpler! Speaking of Apple elegance, go compare chargers.  Dell's 65W brick is huge and clumsy.  Apple's 45W separates in two (you can leave the huge extension cord at home) and is half the size easily.  Plus MagSafe(R) which is brillant.  One downside - FaceTime camera sucks.  They cheaped out and just gave us SD rather than HD.Philosophy - being chained to a desktop is silly.  This is a machine that does almost everything I need a computer to do and it's portable enough that I can BE portable with it.  iCloud and iOS5 will only enhance this.  I've never owned a Mac previously and although I can see some of the shortfalls of Lion already, in general, OS X just blows Windows(R) out of the water.  SSD blows 7,200 rpm SATA drives out of the water.  With typical Apple 'understated elegance' this compact little machine does what I want it to without the typical PC headaches, drama and "cobbled together" feeling.Gripes - Very few and none are deal breakers for me.  The thick extension cord section is silly.  I'm not sold on the Mission Control vs. Lauch Pad vs. Dock location for everything yet.  As another reviewer said, trying to consolidate ALL of Apple's computing OSes into ONE idiom may not necessarily be a good thing.  Keep the desktop metaphor and leave the iOS stuff to MOBILE devices.  Autosave and Versions have some issues.  I'm sure Apple will fix down the road.  As above, this is the old iChat SD camera - HD FaceTime would have been nice as on the MBP.  You make us pay $29 for an Ethernet doggle.Bottom line - it's a player now.  Fully baked and ready for prime time.  I went out and gleefully plunked down money for it.  Probably should have gone 256 GB on the SSD.  Upgrades aren't cost effective or feasible for most of the MBA.  Apple has nailed the target and re-defined the ultraportable class.  Again.  Drop dead sexy design (did I just call a notebook sexy?), competitive hardware, pricing and an OS to match is very dangerous for the competition.  Throw in Apple's carefully orchestrated ecosystem, Genius Bar, lack of crapware, lack of viruses and other Mac virtues and you'll be thinking very hard about getting one.  HIGHLY recommended if you're looking for mainstream computing with ultraportable form factor.  And flying back on the red eye from SLC this evening, every single person sitting up front in the comfy seats with me was drooling over it.  :-)  Definitely going to be a huge hit with the frequent flier miles crowd.  I think it'll do really well on Main St. as well.1 month update 8 26 2011Occasionally drop a known network (home in my case).  No big deal, double click on the network ID, issue resolved.  I did run the update and it didn't fix.  I'm much more comfortable with Lion and have tweaked settings so that mail doesn't hog all the SSD space.  Time Machine works transparently in the background and I'm using an external drive on another PC in my home network!  Very cool.  It's still an amazing piece of hardware and drool worthy.  Almost as easy to transport as my iPad was but it is a real computer.  No qualifiers needed.  I also checked and mine has the faster Samsung SSD rather than the Toshiba.  Thank goodness.  Still wish I'd gotten the bigger SSD.  Oh, my wife wants one so I'll have to go fork out more $$$ this September probably  ;-)7 24 12 update (1 year) - Still love this thing.  Battery has been through 250+ cycles and still within 90% of the original runtime (will get 6 hours if not a little more with most activities although video playback can drain harder).  OS X is virus free, slowdown free, updates on the fly and I'm looking forward to Mountain Lion update coming soon.  My Winblowz desktop gets slower, requires registry cleanup, had a rootkit virus and boots slower as time goes on.  My MBA performs as it did the day I bought it.  Yes it would be nice to upgrade to the USB3 ports, marginally faster SSD and IvyBridge processor with improved graphics performance.  But there is no obsolescence here and this is still very much the machine and form factor that everyone strives to copy and/or beat.  Good luck with that IMHO.  For a highly portable laptop with no MS induced headaches and something that just flat works and serves most of my personal computing needs.  I never felt the need to update a review and brag that my company issued Dell was running as well after 12 months of travel and use.  ;-)  The Dell that I bought for my wife running Win7 after 12 months?  Crippled by the OS, has slowed incredibly compared to when it was new, has a cooling issue or background virus issue with the fan running close to non-stop  I could back all the data off, blow away everything, throw another 4 GB of ram at it and reload OS and data for a clean install.  Defense rests.::volsfan "volsfan"::5.0::July 26, 2011
R2TPTULJVZIUSB::Powerful, Sexy Beast::I just bought the 128GB 13" i5 model of this beauty this past weekend at the Nashville, Tennessee Apple Store. More powerful than I could have imagined. No matter what I throw at my Air, it blows me away. (Ha, a pun!) Simultaneous WoW (highest graphics setting) + Minecraft (highest graphics setting) + Windows 7 VirtualBox VM (for work, don't hate) + GIMP + every application installed == zero noticeable performance drop.I got quite the deal at the Apple Store though. I paid $1250 total for the 128GB 13" i5 model + $100 iTunes card + wireless HP printer, and this is how:I bought it on Tennessee's tax free weekendI got the student discountApple was (is at the time of this review) offering a free $100 iTunes gift card with the purchase of a Mac.A "free printer with the purchase of a Mac" deal was/is going on. (I later sold the printer to my brother for $40!)Regardless of this amazing deal I took advantage of, the MacBook Air would almost be worth any price tag Apple could put on it.The MacBook Air is the sleekest and easiest to use laptop hands down. It either feels like part of the desk or part of me; I can't decide. The backlit keyboard was one of the aspects of the new Air that opened it up as an option, but, honestly, it is faster than 4-year-olds on free ice-cream day.::Daniel Meese::5.0::August 19, 2011

R35QTH09MRTBC8::Nice light laptop::After much research and debate I succumbed to the 256GB Mac Book Air.  Why Because in the last 4 years my family has converted. We started with the Iphone and then the Macbook Pro and the First Gen Mac Air and eventually When we needed one more we did go for an Asus netbook.. not to mention the dead toshiba laptop that is more of a book weight on my table. The windows Pcs and netbooks though have no limitations are a chore to work with once you get spoilt by a Mac.  I even tried a Ipad and felt let down by no flash. That said there are Flash players like Photon and puffin and may more which work well with Ipad too now. But when comparing between the mac air and the Motorola Xoom and the Mac Book Air..The fact that the air would have no limitations other than not being a tablet led me to making the purchase.This is by far the lightest laptop one can have. Sleek and classy. But since I will be putting on a cover that really wont be very obvious.I can have this laptop on my chest while sleeping and work with it.  I do feel I could have used the ipad ...thank to my ipod addiction but I really believe that the ipad screen is not that small and the macbook air is just about a tad bit bigger not to mention it closes so its safer . I  would anyways have to get one of those porfolio case for my ipad which would have made its almost similar in size.i can have the large hard drive space and not to mention the array of apps. ....this version lets you download apps with just 1 click like ur iphone or ipod.I realize the trackpad has more options...The three finger to Copy is awesome. I didnt realise this until I accidentally did it. On further scrutiny I realized there are a few more functions added to the track pad than my old macs.I love the Photo booth and Facetime both.Its 256 GB of flash drive which makes it faster that regular macs and also the 4gb ram is really awesome.Its i5 but u can have i7 for those who need it. For me this itself is an overkill and if my husband would have not pressed on the 13 in screen I reall would have loved the 11 inch.  I did take the 256 GB because I store a lot of photos and educational files on my comp and didnt want and overloaded 128 gb laptop.Apparantly these cant be tweeked to increase Ram but I really dont do all that with a Mac anyways...Windows yes...But i really would not want to risk loosing warranty on my Mac by opening it and replacing it with hardware.I read somewhere that the older versions have no backlit keys ...which is really surprising..because I really thought that was a staple with all macs...That is also one reason I went for the latest one and also the specs with i5 make it more powerful.I have tried the thunderbolt port to watch movies with hdmi...u might have to go into sounds in finder and click on your TV for audio or it may seem like it does not support audio like the old thunderbolt ports.A good complete laptop.Why did I cancel a Star...I really see there is so much competition and considering there is not a huge difference between the older and newer mac book airs this one is still priced very steep.Not to mention no USB 3.0.Else...It more than suits my needs.::mommylove "dc"::4.0::August 3, 2011

R258MKQ8CM49FE::Lightweight but Not::Very satisfied after a year of use.  Lightweight but powerful and responsive.  Keyboard easy to use.  Pictures very clear and precise.  Speed is awesome.  It's a great travel companion.  Purchased DVD drive as add-on to watch family DVDs and movies on the road, and mini-display port to hdmi adapter for hdmi cable connection to tv to show contents to internet-challenged relatives.::Lyle Hamilton::5.0::April 3, 2013
R3V76J4KSQODDF::wifi is a disaster::After a year of owning this piece of cr_p, I'm writing the 1st review of my life.  Anywhere. EVERY DAY the wifi goes out and I have to re-establish the connection.  Today I had to reboot all my computers and the router 3 times.  Even when it's working the internet just freezes up every 5 minutes and says "looking for connection" even if the laptop is inches away from the router/wifi source.  SO painful.  And such an expensive computer.My lousy old Dell is ugly and 3 times heavier but at least the internet /wifi is reliable.This computer is good for watching movies with an external drive.  Would be great for streaming if the internet worked.  Good luck.::pwhy::1.0::November 19, 2012
RQF23TR7OYSCH::In love with this computer.::I know you're going to read several reviews, but mine is just as personal as the others.  I love my MacBook Air.  A few years ago, I bought my first Apple product - the iPhone 1st Gen.  I still have it.  I now have an iPhone 4.  Apple has always been my first choice - regardless.  The MacBook Air is no exception.  I just bought it a few days ago and now I have an iPhone 4, MacBook, MacBook Air, Mac Mini, AND an iPad 2.  By far, this computer is worth EVERY penny you pay for it.  The battery lasts for about 6.5 hours if you're not doing anything intensive (downloads and streaming video).  It's very, very thin and light.  If you're debating a MacBook... I HIGHLY recommend this computer.  Buy it - I never write reviews, but this one was well worth it.::Kevin Edward Jacobs "Jack"::5.0::May 9, 2012

R1O4YRME4WNH41::MacBook Air::I purchased my MacBook Air in Jan 2012.  I always used Microsoft products and decided to try the MacBook.  I have been very satisfied with the product, boots up fast and I love the way you can navigate through the programs.  Also the technical support was great.  Since the MacBook I have also purchased an IPOD, nice item.  My next sytem will be an Apple product.::Chet::5.0::April 15, 2012

R14KFA0DEOGOBE::Amazing::Light, easy to use, especially made for the ones in the design industry. When you are travelling a lot, you need a computer that is light, and works fast.

R24MXJJ8SUS1SP::Fantastic::Just received my macbook air this morning in the mail after anxiously awaiting it's arrival.  Of all the technology/computers/gadgets, I have purchased I do have to say this is by far the best.  I was struggling to determine whether to buy an iMac in lieu of this machine.  Boy am I happy I chose this macbook air.  It is just as fast, but ultra portable...and it has the wow factor.  If you are in the market for a new laptop, get the macbook air...you will not be disappointed!!!::Matt D::5.0::January 14, 2012

R2509OK7DR3AES::Excellent Travel Laptop::Apple makes one of the sturdiest, reliable PC's hands down, the new Mac OSX Lion is a excellent upgrade which gives you a taste of iOS 5 features. The Macbook itself is pretty light and an excellent machine to take on travel. These light weight beasts provide a surprisingly fast experience and are great for people who just want a simple PC that is easy to use. Only downside to it would be no Super Drive - altho thats something being phased out, its something i need to get use to in the future. Overall, its a good buy.::JLo C. "JLo"::5.0::December 6, 2011
R39QD4OH44DYJZ::Command Key on Air::There's a lot already covered with the reviews.  I got the 13" mba with i7 processor.  I like the portability of this machine. Coming from a 17" gaming laptop this is like carrying around a piece of paper. I really like this Apple laptop.  If you can afford it or don't mind spending a premium I would say go for it!Without hashing over what others have already said, one thing that really IRRITATES me that I havent really seen spoken of, is that the left command button was looking dirty on the two mm's.  I tried cleaning it but the smudge wouldn't go away.  Did a little researching on the net and it turns out there are only two lights under the key.  If you look at the right commend button there are three.  Only having two lights is leaves a dark spot where the mm's sit.::Amazon Customer::5.0::November 20, 2011

R2NY8BXEO55752::MacBook Air::I've worked with computers for over 35 years beginning as a Navy telecommunications technician in 1975. This machine is far and away the best computer I have ever owned. It is super fast and super light. It's also a Mac so it's rock solid. It is pricey but it's well worth it.::Roger::5.0::October 26, 2011
R2I1EI239NKGO6::i love this::I just graduated from grad school and started at a job where I travel a decent amount.  I am in no way tech savvy and have always used a PC up until now.  I tend to really only use my laptops for browsing the internet, watching tv, writing, and editing photos.  That being said, I am so happy that I switched to the mac air - it has everything I need in one very cute and easily transportable package.  It's so light and takes up really no room at all so lugging it around through airports and on the road is no trouble.  It is extremely fast and boots up/down in seconds, which is handy when you're constantly on the go.  Everyone asks if this was really worth the price - for me, yes, especially since I plan to keep it for several years.::Kay::5.0::October 23, 2011
R1IZMRCAEZSP58::Beautiful laptop and really stylish above all over!::If you're looking for a slim, travel friendly laptop that is small enough to put in your messenger bag, but still has a screen big enough to work with, this is the laptop for you.  In addition to it's physical appearance, it starts up very fast upon opening and has a backlit keyboard that comes in handly when you're typing in the dark.  Don't have any real complaints about this items except of the compatibility issue that it may have with certain softwares.  I want to get Office Excel and Word and heard there were some issues using this product with Apple, but I won't know until I try it out.  Overall, really good investment and the product is a beauty!::Lee the Reader::5.0::October 21, 2011
R2WC2DGK4QPQP2::Fantastic Laptop::Ordered when Amazon had 20% off. Couldn't wait at that price. Upgrading from a 2010 1.83GHz, 2GB RAM, 128GB MacBook Air to this model. My thoughts comparing the two:* Daily general use has not changed much.* Backlit keyboard for me is essential.* XCode and Photoshop seem snappier on 2011 MBA; iOS simulator loads more quickly.* i5 seems to run a bit cooler than the C2D.* Obviously, 4GB RAM is a big upgrade from the 2GB.* Same for the 256GB SSD.* I have not noticed any perceptible decrease in game quality (but I have a Windows desktop for that).* I have had no real issues with Lion.* Again, $1275 was a no-brainer for the upgrade. At $1599, I probably wouldn't make the plunge from a working 2010 model (wait for refurbished units)::strwrsfrk::5.0::September 7, 2011
RHGYC5HLTJP7W::Much improved.  Ready to be taken seriously!::I am using this new MBA for work, and it doesn't miss a beat.  It feels very solid, has a great screen, and is very fast.  I use a Samsung external DVD when needed, but really I don't miss the built-in DVD drive.  The SSD drive accesses files very quickly.  I use Aperture and it moves very fast.  And with Lion, this computer is the best Mac I have owned to date.  The MBA is no longer a novelty.  It is definitely ready for mainstream, heavy use.::Mark B::5.0::July 26, 2011
R3KY9L84SM300L::Great little laptop!::I work for a company that gives me some stuff that requires a lot of hardcore stuff, but also some stuff like microsoft office. I realized that I needed to start bringing in a laptop for MS office, so I got this little computer, and it's one of the best laptops I've ever used. Now, my home computer, with which I do my hardcore stuff, which includes movies and graphic design is a Apple Mac Pro MC560LL/A Desktop (NEWEST VERSION). I do my MS office stuff on that to, but this is for portable stuff. Two things i was kind of disappointed about was that the computer did not have an ethernet or optical drive, but for that, I got a APPLE USB ETHERNET ADAPTER - ZML, and a Apple Macbook Air Superdrive - MC684ZM/A, which I keep at work. At home, I use the disk sharing thing, which is awesome. The hardware and software are great, and so is the customer service. I recommend this to anyone who needs a little laptop, but does not need it to be as powerful as a Macbook Pro.::smc4242::5.0::May 20, 2012
RRQW24TQA9AEY::Best notebook I have ever owned::By far the MacBook Air is the best notebook that I have ever owned.  I take it everywhere and has bridged the tablet/notebook gap and delivered the best of both worlds.::Derek Sather::5.0::April 21, 2012
R2LEA5DNQTXV6Y::Starting to regret my decision::First off I'll say I'm a casual user. I don't make music or design space rockets on my laptop. I use the internet, use documents and spreadsheets and watch the occasional movie online. I have loved Apple's other products including the iPhone, iPad and iPod. I thought a Macbook Air would be a logical next step when my old PC died. After about 5 months of owning one, unfortunately I have to say it was the wrong decision for me. There are plenty of great features here, the computer is beautifully built and lightweight and yet many of these features are either useless to me as a casual user, and there are enough annoyances that get in the way of my normal use.Pros:-Very light and easy to carry.-Nice lay out and workflow.-Boots up fast (when it does boot up).-Works very nicely with other Mac products (obviously).-You don't have to worry as much about viruses and constant annoying software updates from Java, etc.Cons:-Constant problems with computer not going to sleep and the battery being drained when I want to use it.-Impossible to sync volume across all functions (volume will be different with headphones in, computer still makes start up noise even if previously muted).-Computer doesn't sleep when you close the lid--you need to download a separate app for that.-Many of the fixes for these annoying issues are not found in official Apple guidance and you need to search the internet for third party solutions.-Power cord is too short.Here is a link to a typical work-around solution I found on the internet, note how the author talks about his issue and then at the bottom says he had the reverse issue early on:[...]This is what I have found life with Mac to be like, consistent annoying issues with "easy" work around solutions. It wouldn't be so bad if the cost was comparable to a similar PC model, which I realize has their own set of issues, but when you're forking over more than a $1,000 to do mostly simple tasks you want a close to flawless execution. The Macbook Air 13" has not provided that for me and provided plenty of other things, like triple finger swiping that I have no real use for after saying, "wow, cool."It's like dating a beautiful super model (with expensive taste) that has just enough character flaws to make you question the entire relationship.::justin PL::2.0::March 19, 2013
R30W6LP70G87F::Great product! Had some wifi issue in the beginning but not anymore::EXCELLENT PRODUCT! Price from Amazon is very good too - considering no tax and free shipping.In the beginning, I had problem with constant wifi dropping, it annoyed me quite a bit, I called Apple support few days after I get the computer, wish they would provide me some help/suggestions, the first question Apple support asked was "Have you purchased Apple Tech support (or whatever it called)", after I said no, they refuse to advise me anything. Later i saw it somewhere even if you didn't spend extra money for the whatever Tech support, in the first 14 days or a month after purchasing, you should still be able to get Apple support as a new customer...Anyhow, after searching on Internet by myself, I figured the problem with the Macbook wifi issue could be solved by changing the router or the internet provider, after I changed my internet provider to TWC and changed the router to Netgear, it worked great, never had an issue again.It is my first Macbook, but I was using an iPad for a year, it doesn't take much time to get used to Mac system, and after getting used to it, I absolutely love it!::Jane::5.0::May 23, 2012
R38PK10B04YS8V::super sexy computer::I just love my Apple MacBook Air.  It is so easy to cary around and the keys are really cool.  Easy to type and the keys light up.  I would recommend this to anyone thinking about buying a laptop that is easy to carry.::Suzy Q "Sandy"::5.0::April 25, 2012

R2FP6LILG08Z2E::Puppy Proof!::I bought my macbook air from Apple. I love it!Not only is it slim and light weight, but it is also puppy proof! I caught my almost 3 month old pup gnawing on the corner (not the screen) and no damage was done.::klinardos::5.0::April 24, 2012

R2PNKLQ9BTN429::MacBook Air is beyond description::I've had several laptops in the lat 6 years. Having been disappointed by my last one (bought new from USA and via Amazon), I decided to go for the best. I've therefore had my MacBook Air MC966LL/A 13.3 for about 2 weeks (via Amazon.com). The experience is indescribable!!! I have only myself to blame for having wasted my money for years on poor types. [I've had little time for my other work because I'm discovering new applications]. The best way to know how good it is can only be trying it out. But the most impressive thing is the ease of using it without needing help from others; everything is just there for you!!!.Now that I'm reading the book on Steve Jobs "Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography of Steve Jobs", I've decided to buy the iPad 2 whatever other reviews may say.::Moses K. Musaazi "Kmusaazi"::5.0::October 30, 2011
R3ER1OMYDUPL6R::I love this computer::After 20 years of owning and working with only PC computers I finally (after loving the iPhone) broke down and bought an apple and I am never turning back. What a great mesh of form and function. I highly recommend this compact and powerful computer.::Thomas J. Schmidt III::5.0::October 28, 2011
R206JHRBYMS395::Great laptop::Before getting into the review of this new macbook air (which I am using right now) I must let you know that this is the first mac that I have ever owned. With that being said I will proceed to give you my first impressions.Coming from a windows and linux background, there is a bit of a learning curve to get used to when starting out with the new device. However, after taking the time to get used to it, I have grown to really love this computer. So far the battery life on it has been excellent and the SSD makes disc reads and writes super fast.For anyone that is thinking about getting the 13 macbook pro, stop thinking that and just get the air. Now that they remote drive option is available, there really isn't a need to have the disc drive. Also the screen resolution on the air is much better. Also if you are thinking about getting the 15 inch macbook pro so that you will have a bigger screen, the screen resolution on the 15 inch pro is the same as on the 13 inch air so you aren't really gaining any screen area.I know that I said that I didn't need it earlier but the lack of an optical drive is kinda lame. However, the air is thin and light enough that I can let that slide.The only downside that I have run into so far is when i tried to use an external usb dvd drive to read some of my cd's because the air would not recognize my optical drive.The backlit keyboard is amazing even though there is a little bit of light showing around the edges of the keys. It isn't enough to blind you but it is noticeable.The only real recommendation that I can give to apple about this product is that I would like to see 128gb, 256gb, and 512gb 15 models of the air with a 1200p resolution. That would be awesome.For those of you that are thinking about getting the macbook pro, just go ahead and get the 13 inch air. The air is much better than the 13 inch pro, in my opinion, and much more convenient than the 15 and 17 inch pro. Now if you are going to be doing some serious (and I do mean serious) photo and video editing to the point that you are getting paid to do that, then I would recommend the 17 inch pro. However, for the money, the air is probably the best option.::Sam::4.0::July 23, 2011
R8UC997696M87::It is great...when it was working...::Having been among the first to purchase this machine (i5, 128 GB SSD), I am extremely disappointed to experience that it has stopped functioning, slightly more than 1 year after it has been purchased (Great timing with the warranty, Apple...!).The MacBook is completely dead; it will not turn on whatsoever. Re-setting PRAM and SMC does nothing. And when attempting to disconnect the battery for a power cable connected start only (the last check to do before sending it to repair), I've just discovered I need a special screwdriver to open the back cover, which is not obtainable in my local hardware store.Apart from it missing an HDMI port (with the connector costing a horrendous $40!), instability of wireless connection, and having an un-intuitive operating system (yes, I confess, after using this machine I have become a Windows fan!) it has not been a bad machine.Not quite what I would have expected for a $1300 computer, which has been sparingly used as a home computer only. Time to go short on apple stock.--------- update on 23 May 2013 ----------I shorted Apple stock on $665 and have made a 34% profit so far. The profits far exceed what I paid for the MacBook. Thank you crApple!!!::M. Nagll "fitness freak"::1.0::August 29, 2012
R2JOXP9M0FE24S::This is THE best utlra book... well worth the price::After a month of researching the top ultrabooks, I ended up buying this one for my girlfriend and I could not be happier.Ultrabooks that were considered:-ASUS Zenbook-Acer S3-Lenovo U series-HP Envy14 Spectre-Dell XPS13-Macbook Air 13'Why the Macbook 13' over all the others?-Battery life... it's not the best of the group but certainly enough for daily usage.-Track pad... the best featured track pad I've ever used on any laptop. Very responsive, large and it has the two-finger gestures that make scrolling and navigating a lot easier-Apple's display... no complaints here. The screen is beautiful and the resolution is best in class for a 13' laptop-Light and slim... Thinner profile than the other laptops and I believe it is also one of the lighter if not the lightest. The Design is minimalist and so simple yet sleek and modern.-Benchmarks... this is a top performer between the group I listed. Very balanced.-SSD is fast... boot times are incredible.-Apple OSX... very sleek and modern. I've been a PC user all my life but this OS is easy to pick up and very neat. No pre-installed Windows junk to deal withImprovements(?):-Sound... coming out of the speakers is 'ok' but nothing spectacular-Price... this is 200$ more than the XPS13 and on the expensive side of Ultrabooks, but it is worth every pennyI don't think there is any Ultrabook on the market right now that can beat this Macbook Air 13'. You get what you pay for.::esseun::5.0::May 7, 2012
R2TJJO9MYZYKRE::Ahem....not exactly perfect::I bought this primarily because I was tired of Windows constant need for updates, virus checkers, trojans, reliability problems. I still have 2 windows machines.Pros:generally reliable restarting from sleepfast boot upfast resume from sleepvery sharp screentrack pad is much easier on my hands than a mouse, also much smoother than my toshiba laptopCons:Safari locks up on some sites in version 5.1.1I have had over 1 gig of updates since I have received this.  I guess this is how they keep it secure...but not what I expected.After a long weekend in sleep, it restarted superfast...but then nothing worked, and I had to reboot.  I was hoping to be done with rebooting because of programs failing to operate.Neutral:This gets warm just like any other laptop,  When you stream videos the fan blasts pretty load.::Randy::4.0::November 16, 2011
RJ8SNF58U8ZW3::Love it::Purchased my MC965LL/A a month ago and I am loving it. Does not run hot like my old Macbook Air from 2008 did. On that machine, I had to run the app CoolBook.I haven't noticed any wifi problems. Nice and fast machine. No complaints or problems with it.::Pen Name::5.0::September 8, 2011
R1OTJQZTMQDCYY::Macbook Pro to Air User::I have had a 15" Macbook Pro for two years and just last week upgraded to the Macbook Air. I haven't noticed any speed difference between both of the MacBooks and I definitely like the screen on the Air better (look at other reviews to see the difference). The Air is very light compared to the Pro which is a definite plus. However, the reason why I didn't give it a 5 is because I just purchased this from Amazon last week and yet I received the Air with the LG SDD (which is slower). Look at other reviews and other sites online to find the difference. Also, the Air I received, the trackpad is flush with the rest of the laptop on the left side but on the right side of the trackpad it is lower. I can actually a difference between both sides and it is decently significant. I will most likely request Amazon to replace the laptop and update this review.::Medical Student::2.0::November 6, 2011
R2A7ZDBQ3QQGCL::The Lamborghini of Laptops::I consider the Air to be the Lamborghini of the laptop world.The case is like presicion sculpture - I catch myself admiring it like art.Boot?  Lightning fast.  Programs open and close in a snap.It's nearly always silent - sometimes when watching videos the whisper silentfan comes on and I remember that it even has one.The screen is like a little HDTV, excellent resolution.It's super lightweight - work with it on your lap and you forget it's there.Except for when watching videos for extended periods, it's cool to the touch.Nope, no optical drive, never missed it once.Price?  You get what you pay for.When I have top hop on my wife's new Windows PC,it feels like a time warp to 1998.  Torturous.Just like with the iPod, iPhone and iPad, there willbe futile attempts to copy the Air.Apple smacks yet another one out of the park.::Andrew Krals "Sc00bers"::5.0::August 20, 2011
R2URPXRQJSV1M8::Amazing product, my first Mac OS::Being a longtime Windows user, owning systems with XP, Vista, and 7, I figured it was time to grab a Mac OS laptop. I chose the MacBook Air 13.3 inch 2011 model for several reasons:1) Unmatched portability : Hands down, the MBA is the one of the most portable laptops ever. This allows me to carry it around campus without feeling like I'm lugging a huge book in my backpack (which my other laptop feels like)2) OS X Lion : This version of Mac OS sacrifices some speed for power. OS X Lion grants so much new capabilities, it's quite astounding. The ease of usage is also great, and the learning curve is not too steep. It was easy to get used to using a MacBook.3) Great for class : I find MacBooks perfect for taking notes, or studying off of as compared to a Windows PC. The ease of use, and organization a Mac OS PC gives is undeniably great.::John::5.0::August 6, 2011
R1NI8MKXYM4GL6::great must have::my first mac and I love it.... seller delivered as promised everything was in excellent condition since I don't live in the US.... Great price and features are great... don't like the fact that the touchpad is not really a touchpad where u can just touch it to click on something you actually have to press it and the volume control is a bit annoying since it beeps everything you change the sound but i recommend otherwise::Awesturck::5.0::May 11, 2012
R3KD6O2D5ZZHQ7::WOW::I have owned Apple computers since the original Mac in 1984, so you know I'm a fan (and loyal).  My 4 year old MacBook Pro was failing, and after some back and forth, I decided to replace it with the MacBook Air.  I'm thrilled.  It is light, fast, and to die for.  You have to purchase a couple of accessories that don't come "in the box," such as a connector for ethernet, and for projecting video.  Several reviews indicate that the performance of the MacBook Air is essentially on par with the MacBook Pro.  The decision, for me, came down to the weight.  If you need more storage than the Air has, you will probably want the Pro.  We have come to expect fabulous performance and aesthetics from Apple, and this doesn't disappoint.::college mom::5.0::April 8, 2012
R14YFZWHBV56DB::MacBook Air Time::I did a lot of research before I purchased this. I have a 17" MacBook Pro for my office but needed something a little smaller when I'm in the bedroom watching TV. It is great!::helmut13::5.0::November 25, 2011
R2I8BZHT503DRW::One statisfied PC User::I am application Developer ( web,desktop, and now hand-held gadgets) who was grown on PC (windows).Wanted something very light, small yet powerful with a decent resolution. Well would'nt yah know its a mac!!!.Now I do all my work on this baby. The 1.7Ghz proc is decent enough to accomplish all the my tasks ( Photoshop,Flash,Flash Builder,Visual Studio 2010,Flash Develop )...knock on wood :) and if I need more screen real estate ... hook it up to my 3 yr old  24" Dell (Yes Dell ..they make the best mid level professional series monitors).I must admit I was hesitant at first....but this machine had great reviews....and you know what those reviewers weren't lying.Whats amazing is how zippy it feels thanks to the SSD. This is a blessing (the speed) and a curse (the limited size of 128GB).To remove the curse what I did was only install my programs and everthing else is on external hard drive . Not a bad compromise I think.Oooo ..all my dev programs by the way are run under Windows 7. Yeah...I dual boot....but its great...no problems there...I have yet to feel a reduction in performance.Its amazing how quickly Photoshop (under windows)opens up....sweeet.For my first real dive into world of Mac, OSX Lion is ok (the new gestures,launchpad etc are great actually ) but I'm too sucked in by Windows 7 to leave it (everything is fullscreen ..yeah!!!!)..so..sorry guys ...(u know yourselves).My only real concern tho is after a lot of GPU intensive stuff like videos for example it gets warm at the very back and you hear the whine of the fan... a tad bit loud if you ask me.But hey ..its an i5 cpu in there and the package is crazy small so heat + small fan + crammed notebook shell = a little fan noise...not a deal breaker but its why my review is 4 stars.For me, hardware wise, nobody else makes a product as good as this (yes.. yes I know about Samsung 9 Series...I hate the sheen and low res screen) and quality will always cost you a little more...I'm satisfied!!!::sean o. watson::4.0::August 11, 2011
RD3QT1LWGZMMV::Macbook Air Disappointment::I was really disappointed with this item, as it lasted for six hours and the battery died - for good. Unfortunately, I had taken it out of the country at that stage, so I had to leave it into an Apple resellers, who have had it now for almost a week. First day, they did nothing with it, as they were all on a training course. Second day, they ran diagnostics on it which lasted for most of the day. Third day, they decide its the battery (doh!) and place one on order from Apple. All this, and the laptop was only a few days old. They didn't even think to let me know all this. I had to call several times myself. So much for Apple care. I'll be thinking twice before buying Apple. I never had this trouble with a laptop before and I have bought numerous brands, both for myself and my family.::AMMCD::3.0::November 10, 2011
R3NF6XPVQ9MNC2::Be carefull on exchange policy::I got my new Mac Air and it was minor scratch on the touchpad which cause the pad is not even. When using the pad, I felt something on the pad. I was requesting for exchange via Amazon.com but was unable to exchange. Amazon.com requested me to return and get a new one which the price is even higher. It does not make sense that I got a defected one and even have to pay higher price to get the good one. Disappointed on how they handled the defective product.::CY::1.0::January 3, 2012

R3V6AFUR4SH3C8::Do NOT buy from Amazon...::I bought this item in November as a Christmas present. I was very excited to give it as a gift and when the person opened it on Christmas morning... it was pretty amazing! THEN we tried using it. It wouldn't stay connected to the internet, and we were not able to transfer the info from another laptop to the new one. (probably because of the internet issues) After looking at recent reviews, other people were having problems with it as well. I took it to the Apple Store and they were ready to swap it out, until they found out I purchased it from Amazon. Then they wouldnt touch it. They said it was a known problem and the logic board was causing wifi issues. Certain serial number Macbook Airs all have the same problem. They could repair it for me, but then it would be a refurbished computer that I just purchased at full price.So I have to return it to Amazon who wount replace it because they are out of stock, and wait for it to be returned (UPS Ground) and wait 3-5 days for the refund and then re-purchase the computer and wait for the shipping back to me. Merry Christmas! Here is your new computer for you to receive in February! Enjoy.Amazon doesnt offer expedited returns and when I called and explained my story the lady (Britannie W) sounded like she couldnt care less. She didn't say Im sorry once or offer free delivery when I re-purchased it... not a thing.My advise is to but it from Apple. Sure, you are paying $30 more than the Amazon price, but when it winds up faulty... they will take care of you. Amazon can not say the same.::Matty H.::1.0::January 2, 2012

No power, no nothing. Off to apple repair.Locked into RAM and everything else.  Very little is user accessible.VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUY AND OWN.Think long and hard before you invest.UPDATE:  I took my Mac to the local apple store.

R1VD0XPTSWYBZA::nice piece of engineering but Windows for me.::At ASUS Zenbook was more expensive than Apple Macbook Air, I thought my decision was an easy one. I bought Apple and regret it since then. Obviously it is constructed beautifully but there are many flaws as I see it . The biggest drawback was mousepad. Yes it has pinch zoon,smooth surface but when you actually want to choose something you have to press down that very firm mousepad all the time. Windows laptops allow a tap on the pad to make the selection but not apple. It is a major major draw back . Wifi is very weak for connection too. I can't get the connection from my dinning room while my Android phones are connected to the same wifi network even further away from there in my house. The display isn't sharp enough for me and my 2 yrs old Android tablet has better display. I don't really understand why people are so hyped about this Apple product as it's not definitely for me. Waking up time from sleep , my Dell inspiron 1545 wake up faster and connect faster to Wifi than Macbook Air and My Dell laptop was just over $500 when I bought it. Unless you like touching the frosty cold laptop in the morning,it's not very pleasant for me at all. Palm rest are cold enough to deter you from entirely enjoying using the product. Cut and Paste was simple and done on my Dell but Macbook Air needs the short cut keys to do the job and you know you can't navigate the laptop on short cut keys so have to use mousepad again. Let me conclude it very simple, my old Dell has very easy and reliable mousepad over this Macbook Air. I can zoom on it with one finger ( not two ) , I can scroll on it with one finger ( not two ) , I can make it choose items on display by no effort tapping on the pad or easy pressing left mouse key ( not pressing down the whole mousepad like Macbook Air) , Dell wakes up faster from sleep and no SSD in it like Apple , this good old Dell has backlit LED screen which are as sharper as this Macbook Air..I think I made myself clear about my regrets on this Macbook Air..good luck to you all..::Aussie From Sydney::1.0::May 10, 2012
R2LLIU8IKLIHPA::Comparison to the 2011 Macbook Pro 13"::*2012 Pro and Air models are available but the designs remain the same meaning the physical aspects covered below are the same as well.The primary features of the 2012 13" MacBook Air are:- Ivy Bridge processor + HD 4000 graphics (60% better performance)- USB 3.0- 720p webcam- 2x SSD read speeds. Write speeds didn't change.- $100 price dropI've owned the machine for 10 months now and have simplified the review for your convenience.Things I like:+ Light weight; 2.9 lbs (1.3 kg). You can easily hold it with one hand - the MBP 13" is noticeably heavier at 4.5 lbs.+ Solid build quality like the MBPs. Chassis is rock solid, no keyboard flex, screen housing is rigid with minor flex in the middle.+ Better ergonomics than the MBPs; the palm rest edges don't dig into your wrists like the edges on the MBPs do.+ Same fluid multitouch trackpad and the backlit keyboard makes a return.+ The screen is a pleasure to use with it's high resolution (1440 x 900) and semi-gloss finish.There is no glass cover so there will be dramatically less reflections compared to the screen of the MBPsI personally chose the Air over the Pro because of reduced glare.+ 18 second boot ups and 3 second shut downs. Resumes from sleep within 3 seconds.+ The two USB 2.0 ports are on opposite sides of the laptop (less clutter than MBP)+ Speakers are surprisingly loud; they can fill up a small room.+ Runs extremely cool and it's so quiet that you'll wonder if the fan is running at all.I can definitely feel heat ~ 87 degrees F on the MPB 13's underside after 6 hours of usewhere as the MBA 13's underside stayed relatively cooler.+ Runs Windows 7 just as cool and quietly. (I installed Windows 7 via flash drive)+ Performance is almost identical to the MBP 13" 2011 on everyday tasks because the Core i5CPU can turbo boost to 2.7 GHz and the SSD allows for instant application launching.+ Gaming: it has the same Intel HD Graphics 3000 as the MBP 13" 2011. I was able to runStarcraft II smoothly at low settings on native resolution. Medium settings also ran nicely butyou get less FPS during large battles. League of Legends ran smoothly at medium settings30 FPS flat) on native resolution._______________________________________________________________________________________________________Things I don't like:- *IMPORTANT* Wifi drops - have been less frequent in the wake of more updates from Apple.- The keyboard is shallower and has less travel than the MBP keyboards (you'll get used to itwithin a few days)- The screen has less color gamut than the MBP 13's screen. This screen covers only 46% ofsRGB color spectrum where as the MBP 13's screen covers 77%. For image editing,I would use an external monitor.- The vertical viewing angles aren't so great. One minute tilt of the screen causes colors to shiftdramatically (for example: a purple color can change from lavender to light blue as you tiltthe screen backward or forward). Again, I would use an external monitor for tasks inwhich accurate colors are mission critical. For everyday use it's not noticeable and isactually easier on the eyes than the glare-prone screens of the MBPs.- Not all models come with the same SSD. There are 2 variations; a Samsung SSD and aToshiba SSD. The Samsung SSD significantly outperforms the Toshiba SSD inbenchmarks (check the AnandTech review)To check what SSD you have, click on the Apple logo -> About this Mac ->more info/system report -> then look on the left hand side and click on "Serial- ATA".If your SSD's serial number starts with "SM" it's a Samsung and a "TS" means it's aToshiba.- I personally get 5 hours of battery life max on a single charge while surfing with 10+ tabs open on safari; I got~7 hours doing the same tasks on the MPB 13 2011. My activities included watchingYouTube videos, viewing flash content on tech and news sites, reading/writing email,and using AIM.- No FaceTime HD Camera (720p) as on the MPBs. The quality difference is, unfortunately,very noticeable.- The integrated microphone is located on the side of the laptop instead of on top of the keyboardas on the MBP. During Skype calls, my buddies told me that my voice sounded muffledwhen using the Air. Using a headset with a mic, I was able to improve the sound quality.- The base of the machine developed a creaking noise within the first week of use. I suspect this to becaused by uneven tension in the screws.- after 5 months of, a white cluster of stuck pixels developed in the bottom left corner of the screen.The machine has been handled with care so it's not accidental damage._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Conclusion: Which one should you get?As a college student, I would recommend the Macbook Pro 13". The Air is more than capable of being a primary machine becauseof it's superb performance and overall very good screen. For everyday tasks, it should be snappy and an ease to use.However, students will get a $100 discount on the Pro while the Air only provides a $50 discount. This means that there is a pricedifference of $150 for students. The storage space on the Air is imited to 128GB or 256GB while the Pro comes standard with 500GB.Plus, you can always add a SSD to the Pro later on. The Pro will be the better choice for creative students because it's screen has more colorgamut than the Air's. Lastly, you are getting a full voltage processor which can make a differencein video encoding or other CPU intensive tasks.If you are not a student:If you value the extra ports (Ethernet, Firewire, optical drive), a high gamut screen (although more reflective), a 720p webcam(it's a lot better), and the ability to upgradelater down the line - go for the Pro.If you prioritize portability (light weight), higher screen resolution, fast boot ups/shut downs, and less reflections - go for the Air.In everyday performance the Air feels faster when booting up and launching applications because of its SSD. In CPU intensive tasks,the Pro will have a slight edge but not much. (the two CPUs are actually pretty neck to neck on GeekBench benchmarks). They bothhave the same graphics chip but note that the Pro will get better battery life (1-2 hours more) than the Air because the Pro has a biggercapacity battery (63.5 watt-hours vs. 50 watt-hours)Unfortunately, my unit is affected with a wifi drop problem. I don't know if you will encounter the same issue but if you buy an Air froman Apple Store, make sure to test the wifi out by using it on multiple networks. If you encounter any erratic wifi drops withinthe first 14 days - demand a refund or an exchange._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Update - December 27th, 2011After installing the 10.7.2 and a firmware update, the wifi connections in my dorm room became more reliable.However, after taking it home I experienced drops as before on the home network. I DOUBT it's a problem with myrouter because ALL other connected devices work fine. The 2011 MBP 13" I previously owned worked flawlessly on my network.This is most likely a problem with the Air's drivers. 5 months after product launch, I don't believe Applehas acknowledged the issue or either chose to IGNORE it as other users on the official forums continue tohave similar complaints even to this day.Hardware wise,  the casing held up well except for a scratch on the side. The lid is frighteningly thin and I've readreports of the screen's fragile nature - cracking at the slightest bump by another object. I would handle with care.Want to know something funny? With the machine off, I can see through the Apple logo on the lid if there's lightbehind it - it's that thin.Software wise, sometimes the machine would run hot with fans blazing full throttle when watching HD YouTube videosand would remain that way even though I close everything. Very odd. A quick reboot solves the problem.A creaking sound developed within a week of purchase. When I lift the machine up, press on the palm rest or type on itthere would be a creaking noise produced. I suspected the screws of the bottom to be loose so I decided to tighten them.Note that you'll have to order a pentalobe screwdriver to do this - the screws aren't the typical type._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________January 9th, 2011A cluster of 4-5 stuck pixels developed so I went to get a screen replacement. The Apple genius confirmed it was4-5 pixels which qualified me for a screen replacement. Service was prompt and I got the machine the next day.However, the new screen had 2 clearly visible dead pixels in the center of the screen. I tried using it for a few daysbut they were an absolute distraction.Dissatisfied, I took it back to another genius only to be met with rude service. I stated that the dead pixels hinderedfunctionality as they were visual distractions. He snidely responded with, "Where? I don't even see them" and remainedadamant about not replacing it because I didn't qualify for the "minimum of 5 dead pixels for a replacement" policy.It was an unpleasant experience to say the least and didn't help._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________March 11th, 2011I've learned to live with the two dead pixels on the screen and Apple has released an update (10.7.3) to address thewireless card. I've noticed that with Bluetooth off, the connections are pretty stable around campus and at home.I've not yet tested this with Bluetooth - it makes me curious because people on the official forums report wifi drops whenenabling Bluetooth. Anyway, After 7 months of ownership I would say most of the initial bugs have been remedied andthe Air is a pleasure to use. However, I speculate that the Pro and Air lineup will be updated to Ivy Bridge in the summer(along with the rumored redesign of the Pros). Buy now if you need it but if you can - waiting might be better.Cheers!::Wayne Ngo::4.0::July 29, 2011
R3MKO486GGK450::Great Looks, Speedy Laptop. Gets hot and loud under moderate CPU load.::I have been using my new 13" Macbook Air, 256GB, Core i7 for just over a week and here are my impressions...First, the good stuff...- The industrial design is absolutely gorgeous and rock-solid. The laptop is thin, light and pleasure to look at.- Screen is 13" but the resolution is comparable to that of most 15"+ laptops. Perfectly usable for graphic/software development. While Macbook Air uses (supposedly) an inferior TN panel compared to Macbook Pro, I did not find a drastic difference between the two (I also own a 17" Macbook Pro). The Air has slightly smaller viewing angles and perhaps not as good colour reproduction, but the differences are subtle. Also, there's a lot less glare on Air's "glossy" display compared to glossy Macbook Pro.- Performance is great, in some cases it bests the Quad Core i7 17" Macbook Pro, thanks to its SSD Drive. Startups/shutdowns are super fast and the applications open/close almost instantly. Having said that, do not expect to do any serious gaming on this little guy. The built-in Intel graphics chip has hard time handling even 5 year old games and is actually slower than nVidia chip on the previous generation Air.- Expect to get about 4-5 hours of mixed use out of "7 hour" battery. That's what I average while doing some Photoshop and web dev work, browsing, listening to music and viewing a few video clips.Now, the negatives...Well, it's one negative really, but it is something I find extremely annoying. The laptop gets VERY hot when CPU usage approaches 50% and the fan kicks in full-blast at 6,000+ RPM.I first noticed the excessive noise when I was transferring my data and applications from the time machine backup upon initial setup. The fan stayed on entire time, CPU temperature was approaching 90C while being only 30% utilized.I continued to experience high heat/fan noise issues throughout the week. Sometimes it was during routine web browsing where some of the websites contained Flash elements. Starting Windows XP in Parallels would immediately set the fan in motion, again, sometimes hitting 6,000+ rpm. Playing Civilization IV, a fairly old game, had fan going full blast entire time with CPU again reaching 90C. Apple's own "Cosmos" screensaver brings the CPU temperature up to 80-85C and the fan up to 4500-5000rpm. The most annoying thing -- none of these tasks were taxing the CPU at more than 50%!I did a fair bit of research on this issue. There are multiple discussions on Apple, MacRumours and other forums about excessive heat and fan noise. Also, many report increased heat on their older Apple laptops after upgrading to Lion, so perhaps (fingers crossed), there's a patch on the way that will improve thermal management somewhat.The thought about returning the Air for refund did cross my mind, but I decided to keep it in the end. I am not a gamer and doing my work (web/mobile development) is not very taxing on the CPU, however, I do not think it is unreasonable to expect relatively quiet operation on such premium laptop with only 50% CPU usage. I can only hope that Apple is listening and looking to remedy the problem.***Update: March 28, 2012***It has been several months since I purchased the Air, so I thought I'd write a quick update.There were no software updates from Apple that would fix the overheating issue. Some claim in the comments that the thermal problems are limited to Macbook Air Core i7 version, however, I got to play with friend's Core i5/120Gb Air and got the fan hitting 6,000+ rpm simply by opening two browser tabs with YouTube videos in them. The playback has become choppy pretty quickly as well. The fan was also audible on pages with a few Flash elements in it (like newspaper sites). It seemed slightly (very slightly) less prone to heat issue, but it's definitely there.I also played around with an 11" Macbook Air Core i5 at the Apple Store and, interestingly enough, it handled Flash far better than (supposedly) more powerful 13"... I opened 5! 1080p YouTube videos and still wouldn't hear the fan... Quite amazing actually. The difference seems to be the i5/i7 processors in the 13" Air that can hit higher clock speeds but nearly frying the internals in the process.If you find your Macbook Air fan going off like a jet engine every time you visit YouTube or any page with Flash content, here are a couple of browser plugins that I found helpful (they block movies until you specifically click on them):- FlashBlock for Firefox- ClickToFlash for SafariThere's a model refresh coming sometime this summer, apparently, and I hope Apple will figure out the way to solve this problem. Of course, much depends on Intel chips that they're going to use in new models.::Alex Green "alx779"::3.0::August 15, 2011
RE4KOXG8PX8RG::The best ultraportable laptop produced thus far...::Background:For the past two years or so I've gone through numerous brands/models in an incessant search to find a laptop that was easily portable and had enough horsepower to match or exceed the performance of a solid $500 desktop with enough battery life to last over four hours of real world use. In this time span I've gone through over a dozen laptops or netbooks that were eventually returned, sold, donated to family or friends, modded and repurposed, or are currently sitting collecting dust awaiting a similar fate. A short list of the more memorable laptops/netbooks that I've previously owned/used that I can remember off hand include: HP TM2T(Core 2 Duo); HP TM2T(Core i3), Asus T101MT, MacBook Air (2009), Acer 4820TG, HP Envy 14, HP dv7t Quad Edition, ASUS U36JC, MacBook Pro 13, and two lower cost laptop models made by Gateway and Acer that I won't mention because they really didn't fit the criteria I was looking for when I acquired them.I can truly say the 2011 MacBook Air 13" is the most satisfied I've been with any laptop I've used. Although I do find some quirks with the 2011 MBA lineup they are passable and this product still deserves a full five stars. I will probably echo some of the same pros and cons that others have stated, but let's move on with my review so I can tell you my impressions of this.HARDWARE PROS:- Weight/Form Factor: I've always considered portability to be important in a laptop but I can't emphasize this enough. If you've never held and used a MacBook Air before you should be impressed by its weight and form factor alone. Mostly anyone could easily hold the 13" MacBook with one hand. It means I can be watching a video and if I need to move to another room in the house and can easily walk with the laptop in one hand. However, I don't think it is light/comfortable enough to hold while standing for prolonged periods of time. I've demonstrated how light it is to several people under 5 feet tall by stand and watch a YouTube video holding the MBA with one. So, if you're concerned about the 13" size because you're short you shouldn't let that deter you until you actually try it.- Core i5 2nd Generation Sandy Bridge Processor/ 4GB RAM Standard: When I first got the 2009 MBA I was extremely impressed by its form factor and weight as stated above, but after trying to use the 2009 MBA for productivity and multitasking you realize that something is amiss in the hardware and this eventually leads to frustration. The 2009 and 2010 MacBook Air base models only included 2GB of RAM and missed an entire generation of Core i-series processors, and despite having a solid state hard drive and a dedicated graphics card their of value in price to performance was very underwhelming compared to what was available for much less at the time. I currently have 16 tabs opened across four windows in Firefox, 5 tabs in Chrome, two applications(Silverlight and Java) streaming live financial quotes, DropBox, iTunes and a P2P application running while I am typing this review. I haven't noticed any noticeable hitches in performance. I have read about others complaining about issues with various Adobe software (especially Flash) with the latest version of OS X Lion. I have only experienced some sluggishness once when resuming from deep sleep. For testing I used a downloaded Flash game. It took a little more than 10 seconds to re-render. However, this may have more to do with the integrated graphics and could possibly be corrected in the future with an update.- Solid State Drive: There's not much to say here. If you've never experienced the performance leap from using a SSD then you will probably be more than a little impressed by the much faster load/boot times. I've installed SSDs on a few computers after talking up the performance boosts. I guess they were expecting everything to be instantaneous. Anyway, it's very noticeable in Bootcamp running Windows over the MBP 13 I've been using or when transfering/copying larger files. You can read more about the much faster load/boot times from other reviews online.- Trackpad: Quite often, previous MacBook owners don't mention this as a Pro. However, the trackpad is the biggest reason why I prefer a MacBook as my laptop of choice. I grew tired of the jumping cursors, crappy drivers, and erratic touchpad gestures. For some reason Synaptic and most PC vendors overlook or can't seem to get it right. How do you neglect its importance as the primary functioning hardware you use to actually interact with your computer. The trackpad on the MBA just works. It works so well and is far more than accurate enough that I actually prefer not using a mouse with my laptop because of it.- Backlit Keyboard: The keyboard itself may take some getting used to if you've never used a MacBook before. However, once you grow accustomed to the layout you will enjoy the amount of travel and "clickiness" to it. Thankfully, the backlight was brought back for the 2011 lineup. I don't understand why this feature was removed to begin with since it doesn't impact battery life that much. It's clutch and greatly appreciated in low lit environments.- Build: It's the same aluminum casing material used in all the MacBook models and the same chassis design that was used in the 2010 model. Solid constructionHARDWARE CONS:- No USB 3.0: Although USB 3.0 is not as ubiquitous USB 2.0 it is quickly growing and peripherals are far more abundant and less expensive than Thunderbolt peripherals. USB 3.0 will likely remain far more popular than Thunderbolt after Apple's exclusivity expires next year because USB 3.0 is more cost-effective to produce and is backwards compatible with the millions of USB 2.0 devices already available. I agree with other reviewers in that this reduces the future proofing of this model, and it seems like Apple's Firewire vs USB 2.0 situation repeated. (I digress that at least there are two USB 2.0 ports on opposite ends. My original 2009 MBA had one.)- Facetime Camera not High Definition: I try not to show my mug on camera but sometimes I have to use it to speak to clients via remote connections and occasional video conferencing. Again, considering the profit margins on each MBA sold I don't understand the reason to exclude this feature other than Apple being Apple and including this as an improved feature for next year.- Power Button: The power button is placed in the keyboard layout right above the delete key!!! It's where the eject button is on my MBP right above the Delete key. Yes, I just praised the keyboard in the Pros. Until you grow accustomed to this your chances of accidentally hitting the power button by mistake in the beginning is likely. It won't shut your computer down or put the computer to sleep. It simply brings up the power down dialog, but it's still a questionable button placement.- Memory is not upgradeable: Not much more to add here. 4GB is enough for me and the SSD is definitely a huge boost to hard drive caching.- Need adapters for HDMI, VGA, DVI. At this price and considering the profit margins on each unit sold the adapters at least an adapter for HDMI or VGA should be included. Meh...OS X LION PROS: (because it deserves its own section)- Mission Control and Spaces: I really like it. I used spaces on Snow Leopard with full screen apple(via third party apps) and this makes using it that much easier. You can drag windows from Space to Space to re-arrange your groups. It's a great improvement that can be improved.- Cloud/App Store Operating System Installation: No 50 character CD Keys, scratched backup disks, or corrupt files on your thumb drive. Cheaper prices.- Automatic Resume: It seamlessly automatically saves the last state of your applications. Some users don't like that applies universally to every open app, but it's very simple to prevent from occurring. If you are done with an and want to prevent said app from automatically restoring simply right click its icon in the dock press option and select force quit. Another app I've used is Flexiglass which adds the functionality of right clicking the red X to completely close an app and all its windows.OSX LION CONS: (because it deserves its own section)- Launchpad: This was a poor, not well executed integration into OS X. Out the box the Launchpad replaces the App Folder in the dock that used to be next to documents and the trash bin. I actually stared at the screen for a few moments until I dug through the search results. I've tried to use it. It keeps the desktop icon less cluttered for me and I moved many of the icons I typically place there in the Launchpad. However, customizing the Launchpad has its quirks. For instance, adding and renaming folders/icons in the Launchpad isn't just easily done on the Launchpad by right clicking the icon. You have to open it in Finder to rename it. There are no options to change the gesture in System Preference to view the Launchpad. I truly feel like the default gesture was tested using the midgets or elementary school kids. My hands are too big to consistently do the gesture. You'd think I could palm two basketballs with one hand. Right now, the launchpad is quirky and somewhat redundant. I understand the direction Apple is heading and are thus slowly blending touch-based iOS and traditional Mac OS X, but the way Apps for OS X are distributed and the complete integration is definitely not with us today in any of Apple's lineup. Hopefully, things will improve with future updates. My hopes is that the launchpad serves as a replacement for Show Desktop in the future.- Natural Scrolling: By default scrolling is inverted. Some like it, some don't, most people will find it awkward at first and I'd bet the majority no matter how slim will change this back. I'd prefer an opt-in integration method for this if Apple wanted to change several decades of computing.- Three Finger Back/Forward and Scroll to Top/Bottom:  I don't know why this configuration was changed from 10.6 to 10.7 but out the box you may notice when you run a third party browser such as Firefox or Chrome that you are unable to page back/forward using the old gesture three finger swipe left/right. Well, you have to change "Swipe between pages" to "Scroll Left/Right with Two or Three Fingers" under Systems Preferences->Trackpad->More Gestures. A gesture that is now missing entirely is three swipe up/down to scroll to top/bottom but I found a solution with an app called BetterTouchTool By Andreas Hegenberg. It's a very good tool to customize the trackpad gestures to your liking.Expose: No minimized apps unless you are using another window of said minimized app. I don't understand the logic as to why this was removed. It was still featured to be working during the beta but has been removed. The last time I can remember having to click more than twice to view a minimized window was Windows 3.1. Again, I would prefer if this option was carried over from the Beta and preferred an opt-in integration method for this if Apple wanted to change a decade plus of computing.OSX LION NEURAL OR MEH: (because it deserves its own section)Many other changes in Lion were under the hood; complete migration to 64-bit and complete Trim support. A lot of the bundled apps have been improved particularly Mail, Lion Recovery, FileVault, AirDrop, Versions, overlay scroll bars. Some improvements are bigger/more noticeable than others. Also, you can now re-size windows from any corner/edge: Nothing innovative; better late than never; nice for those who are coming from Windows and haven't/won't use other third party accessibility apps.OTHER THOUGHTS:- Screen: I've seen others mention the difference in screen quality between the MacBook Air and Pro models. I have noticed a slight difference. Two things that immediately affect your PERCEPTION of the screen are the resolution and the fact that the area surrounding the display on the MBA is metallic gray vs glossy black on the MBP. When you're comparing the two you might not think that matters. The screen on the MBA does use TN panels but they are far better than your typical run of the mill 1024 x 768 that continues to flood the laptop industry that I typically see. Because of its screen resolution I can dock windows side by side easier on the 13" MBA than I could  with a 17" HP dv7 quad core edition that I used. No lie.- Battery Life: Don't believe the advertised 7 hours of battery life unless you're using a third party utility or disabling all wireless connections and dimming the screen down. However, I easily get about 5 hours surfing the web indoors. I've gotten a little under four hours streaming financial quotes and actively surfing indoors, but I'd typically have it plugged in if I need it for more intensive productivity tasks. Definitely not as good as the MacBook Pro 13".- No Restore Drive: I understand this was a concern for some. Apple released the free Lion Recovery Disk Assistant from Apple's support page. You can make your own recovery thumb drive on a low cost thumb drive of your choice or you can order an OS X Lion Thumb Drive for Apple's Mac App Store for $69 which was released today.- Graphics: Will it max Crysis? No... I have a desktop rig for that when I want. This is an ultraportable laptop and IMO it's the best available.OTHER TIPS:Screen Keeps Dimming and Brightening: At first, I thought it was because i was using the charger from my MBP and I was ruining a brand new expensive --- computer, but I was 98% certain that couldn't be the case. I went to Systems Preferences -> Energy Saver and unchecked Slightly dim the display when using this power source but that wasn't the case because it wasn't on battery. Anyway, I unchecked Automatically Adjust Screen Brightness under Display and felt as if 7 million brain cells must've died beforehand because it took a while to figure it out, but that solved it.Security: Please change your broadcasting discoverable wireless settings and enable your firewall under System Preferences. This is especially true if you are going to use this extremely portable laptop in public areas. Although, Macs aren't targeted nearly as much as Windows or the most popular Linux Distros you are not secure if leave the door wide open.I avoided the expensive adapters and bought two aftermarket adapters to suit my needs that have worked well thus far. Kensington USB Mini Dock with Ethernet for Mac/PC which provides 3 USB 2.0 ports and an ethernet port. You can find a HDMI adapter for very cheap. Though, they may only last several months you could order a dozen of them. Again, I strongly recommend BetterTouchTool if you are looking to gain back the same gestures from Snow Leopard.SO, THE QUESTION IS SHOULD YOU CONSIDER BUYING AND WHAT MODEL?Obviously, this depends on your needs and budget. I feel the MBA is the best ultraportable available and if you can go without a DVD drive an a few extra ports my recommendations are the high end 11" MacBook Air or the base model 13" MacBook Air as others have stated. The 4GB vs 2GB makes a difference. The deciding factor would be $100, portability, and how much screen real estate you feel you is adequate for you.I considered buying one of the best alternatives, the Samsung Series 9. The included warranty was enticing but I've had to deal with servicing a laptop through the mail four times and it's never pleasant. Resale value was another factor, and though it has one of the best touch pads I've used on Windows until Synaptics releases their next generation touch pads and trackpads it still felt subpar. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to get back into cross-platform development for OS X. However, another decent alternative to consider is the Toshiba Portege R835 if you are looking for an ultraportable with very strong battery life.I want to raise a point not many people write about in their reviews and that is SSD performance over time. Although, OS X Lion includes TRIM support the performance of all solid state drives degrades as you store more data to the drive. I've experienced this with a couple of desktop builds I've done. With some SSD's the performance degradation begins after filling up just half the disk drive, and affects nearly all drives to some extent once the drive is 70% full. This is something to consider when storing data. An external storage solution of some kind is strongly recommended.Currently, there are two different solid state drives that ship with the MacBook Airs. One is made by Samsung and is the higher performing drive and the other is made by Toshiba. You can check which version you have by going to About this Mac->System Report->More Info click Serial-ATA and check the the first two letters of the model after APPLE SSD.  Credit goes to Amazon user Wayne N for pointing this out in his review. I haven't read any benchmarks on the performance over time with the new MBA.I personally purchased the 256GB model because I need to store financial data and I need a large Bootcamp partition for Windows to compose and sample music, coding that involves very large libraries and enough storage for music and the occasional movie if I'm not on my home network. So, everyone's needs are different. Still, SSD size and degradation is something to consider for your intended use. The MBA is not a true desktop replacement especially if you're into playing games (of any kind if you want decent graphics) but I feel that the MBA can serve as a your primary computer depending on your needs.Thanks for reading this lengthy review. Hope it helps in your decision.::R. Chapman::5.0::August 16, 2011

R11HIY6RKIZUBF::Good laptop, but overhyped::I've been using a Macbook Air for a week now.  I have the 2011 13" ultimate: i7 1.8GHz, 4GB RAM, and 256SSD.  My main uses are Office for Mac 2011, Skype, internet video, ArcGIS/Windows 7, Mathmatica, Matlab, C/C++, objective-C, and Java. At the moment I mainly use the Air for writing documents.  I am trying to live with the Air as my primary machine and I plan to connect it to a thunderbolt monitor for additional screen real estate.Pros:The Air looks beautiful and Lion is an absolute pleasure to use.  The SSD makes it all work together.  The screen is gorgeous to look at under the right lighting conditions and the resolution is fantastic. The keyboard is generally good. The track pad is awesome and the diagonal cut of the case is much easier for writing on than my previous unibody macbook.Cons:* Build quality. The renowned Apple quality seems to be lacking in my unit. The space bar does not always respond and requires two press from time to time.  The F5 key needs to be hit multiple times in order to work. The case does not seem to fit properly in the lower right corner of the unit and flexes. The screen gets darker edges near the silver bezel.* Skype and facetime.  I find that the placement of the mic on the side of the unit is a disaster for these applications.  I am constantly responding to complaints about poor voice quality that only improves if I turn the machine on its side and speak directly into the mic.  Depending on your use this may not be a big problem, but it is for me.* The screen can be irritatingly reflective under fluorescent lighting, but I can usually adjust my position to compensate.  However, I usually need to use a low screen illumination to get reasonable battery life, which compounds any glare problems.  This is not a major issue unless you are sensitive to glare.* The battery life on my unit is not great.  The first two days I was impressed with 7+ hours.  A week later and I'm lucky to get 4 hours.  Disappointingly the unit does not always seem to hold a full charge.  I'm not even sure I could watch a full-length movie without mains power. Part of the problem is flash, but watching any video drains the battery at an alarming rate.  The battery monitor also does not seem to provide a reasonable estimate of remaining time.* When watching video I have noticeable screen stutter.  This could be a result of the streaming service I use, but I'm not sure.  It is not so bad that I would return the unit for it, but it is there and if you value smooth video then be sure to check it out carefully before you buy.* The Air gets blisteringly hot near the charger connection when running heavy applications. The fan comes on and battery life evaporates.  Some complain the fan is noisy, but my main problem is the impact on battery life.* The ram can only be maxed out at 4GB.  This is really annoying when you need to dual boot and is compounded by the graphics chip using main memory.* There are also two SSDs (Samsung and Toshiba) that the machine ships with. I ended up with the slower Toshiba drive.  I do get the beach ball from time to time, but I could not say that this is related to my unit shipping with the slower Toshiba drive.  Generally things are snappy.  However, instant on is not always instant. I don't know if this is related to the slower Toshiba drive or just the applications I have open.All in all this is a good machine, but not outstanding. I would say the Macbook Air has been seriously overhyped.  It has some strong points.  I enjoy using it and the portability and weight are outstanding.  However, I am genuinely frustrated by the mic placement and poor build quality.  There are solutions, but when you spend $1700 plus tax on a machine I think you have the right to expect it to work. The Toshiba drive is annoying, but may not be significant and the battery life is a worry.  I'm not sure how the machine will standup to the day-to-day grind.This unit is going back to the store and Apple deserves full credit for its return/refund policies.  The 14 day, no restocking fee, window offered to return or exchange a unit is outstanding.**** Update September 30:Apple's customer service is fantastic. Apple provided a new unit which seems to have fewer build quality problems: all the keys work, the unit shipped with the Samsung SSD, and the microphone is much better.  However, I still have problems with the microphone position and sensitivity and while battery life is better on this unit it is still not great for watching video.  Instant on is still not instant on, but I can support other reviewers who have not noticed any performance difference between the Samsung and Toshiba SSDs, although I'm glad I have the samsung drive. All-in-all my new Air deserves at least another 1/2 star, may be even a whole star because of Apple's customer service.::Nick::3.0::September 12, 2011
R3JMDLOK0YAO2Q::2011 Macbook Air - (Nov 2011) - 1.8 ghz i7 4GB 256GB SSD::Well, i have had the Macbook Air 13.3", 4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, 1.8 Ghz Core i7 for about 2 days now.Not a PC Hater....nor an Apple Fanboy. Just need something that is a BEST FIT at the time i am buying the laptop.>> Well, this happens to be thanksgiving now, so hoping Apple will price match my laptop as its still within the 14 days before it hits Thanksgiving.This review would like to address questions you have over:1) Macbook Air (or) Macbook Pro2) How well Macbook Air will Fit your daily usage & stacks up as a Casual Laptop3) How well the Macbook Air stacks up as a Travel Laptop4) How well the Macbook Air stacks up as a Work/Business Laptop-------------------------------------------------------------My profile:-------------------------------------------------------------1) PC & IT Techie2) Looking to Buy the Macbook Air as my personal Laptop when i am in between IT Consulting Jobs.(Had a work Laptop since the past 5 years and had to hand it over once i changed jobs)3) Previous Macbook Air owner(2010 Macbook Air; 1.8ghz core2duo, 4GB, 128 GB;); (My FIRST Mac; Bought it for my Dad..used it for a bit..and loved it.)4) Travel a lot (Work & Pleasure);5) Budget of $1500-$1600-------------------------------------------------------------B. My Buying considerations/requirements for a new Laptop:-------------------------------------------------------------1) Need a Laptop that MUST/MAY have the Latest & greatest in CPU/Memory/HDD/USB specs2) Need a Laptop that MUST/MAY definitely have a gorgeous screen & High Resolution (1920xwhatever; 1080p)3) Need a Laptop that MUST be Vibrant, easy on eyes; For a 7-8 hr workday on the laptop, i need a Display that is vibrant and less strenuous on eyes;4) Need a Laptop that MUST run Windows 7 also to provide for Corporate VPN connectivity.5) Need a Laptop that MUST be very Light. Preferably 13" screen(with HiRes)....but 15" is OK, provided it has the higher resolution.6) Need a Laptop that MUST/MAY have good build Quality and Decent in Looking.7) Need a Laptop that MUST be good to use for Color Editing/Accuracy of colors for Light Home use Photography.8) Need a Laptop that MUST have about 250 GB of space.>> My Documents excluding PICTURES amount to ~100GB.; A 256 GB SSD is the perfect size for me the next 3 yrs.9) Need a Laptop that MUST have about 5 hrs of battery at least (I usually am on 3-3.5 hrs flights in travel)10)Need a Laptop that MUST have a HDMI port to connect and watch movies in TV.-------------------------------------------------------------C. The competition (read Non-Mac and My choices of Laptops)-------------------------------------------------------------1) Not really much into Dell, Toshiba, HP, Lenovo>> Had a Thinkpad before last year and that went just shy of over a year>> The Dell XPS Laptop in my interest was too bulky and looked horrible. Size of screen; 15" for the desired 1920 resolution.>> The HP Laptop (dv6t - Quad/Select) edition laptop was good on Technical Specs, but again, build was too bulky and Plasticky. Size of screen; 15" for the desired 1920 resolution2) The Samsung Series 9 Laptop>> When configuring the Samsung Series 9 to have 1.8Ghz Core i7, 8 GB RAM 256 GB SSD, it was coming upto $2100 all incl(give or take another $100); This was too expensive for me..even though the laptop looked good. Besides, i wanted to use MacOS also occassionally as i liked the Interface.3) All the laptops here were about 6 lbs atleast...excluding the Samsung series 9.-------------------------------------------------------------D. Why i bought the Air-------------------------------------------------------------1) ** MacOS2) ** 256 GB SSD was perfect storage vs Speed Size for me.>> I did not need the slower and extra space in the 700 GB 7200 rpm.>> Besides, i wanted to take a laptop and buy an SSD later. I did not want to pay premium for 700 GB drive.3) ** Battery Life (Minimum 5 hrs met my requirement)>> My earlier 2010 Macbook Air core2Duo used to last me >6 hrs between charges4) ** Processor Speed>> I wanted an i7 processor and the updated Macbook Air specs allowed for it.5) ** Screen/Resolution:>> Higher resolution on the 13" Macbook Air which i believe was greater than the 15" regular MBP definitely looked good>> A visit to the apple store showed how excellent the screen is>> A Bootcamp installation of Win 7 and the screen really compares with the 15" 1920x resolution models>> The screen on the macbook air 13" is phenomenal!...and very easy on the eyes.6) ** RAM:>> While it was tempting to opt for the HP dv6t, which could take upto 16GB RAM, i decided that 4 GB should be enough for my usage in the Macbook Air.7) USB 2.0:>> Would have liked USB 3.0, but decided i would wait the additional time out during data transfers.8) Minidisplay Port to HDMI:>> I used to connect my older 2010 Macbook Air to my HDTV with Video/Audio out. No issues. This was definitely not an issue here.9) Dual Booting into Windows 7 using Bootcamp:>> I actually tried this out last night and it was quite painless.>> Currently typing this review from Win7 on my 13" Macbook Air.>> Split my 256 GB SSD drive into 85 GB for MacOS and 150 GB for Win7.>> The Windows 7 partition stores my work outlook and regular windows files.To summate my reasoning:Though the Processor in the Macbook Air was not the full quad core i7, my reasoning was the SSD should more than make up for routine tasks.>> For the additional, occassional, slightly heavier processing like editing RAW DSLR images,i hope that the i7 processor i selected as upgrade should more than provide the additional punch.>> Yes. There is a drawback of slightly higher Fan Noise...but this is temporary.>> There was nothing in the market to beat the Value/Lightweight offering of the Macbook Air, when you factor in the SSD.>> The resolution and Screen and battery were all fabulous!-------------------------------------------------------------E. Buying the Macbook Air-------------------------------------------------------------Finally Bought the 13" Macbook Air 1.8Ghz Core i7, 256 GB SSD, 4 GB RAM>> Total cost with Sales Tax: $1739.00-------------------------------------------------------------F. Usage/Experience with MacOS------------------------------------------------------------->> MacOS Lion is quite nice actually.>> The interface and the Macbook Air screen really pop out for a 13" screen.>> The OS does not feel heavy/bog down on the available resources>> So far, i have just done general browsing and causal fiddling with the specs.** Will update once i work more.To summate: Love the MacOS Experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!------------------------------------------------------------------G.

R3QJMJOUVHYKVV::APPEAL: Yes.  VALUE: Yes.  Apple understands.::Those that saw my previous review of the 2010 11" MacBook Air will fully understand that title.  The 2010 MacBook Air suffered from a lack of true value, attempting instead to do the absolute minimum in an attempt to appeal to people's aesthetic tastes while sacrificing key features and not pushing the envelope.  Well, with the 2011 version, they have gone back to the drawing board.  Indeed, they have released what the MacBook Air should have been all along.  You can read the specs above for details about what is all here. I'm only focusing on what's improved over the last gen.After re-reading my review, I decided to reorganize things for fluidity.  So I'm going to first start with the general hardware and its approach.  First, let's talk about what's good.- Base 13" is a great deal if you don't need storage on the device.  The price is set just right, and there are very few compromises here.  You can go to the higher storage for $300 if you want, but honestly, just buy an external for $100.  My opinion.- Apple has returned the backlight keyboard.  There was huge consumer demand for this feature, and removing it was pointless.  The machine is so much better with it back, and did great on the night flight back to San Diego.- Mail is no longer a battery killer.  In the older version of the MacBook Air, running the Mail app used to destroy the battery something fierce.  Battery life is a little lower, but realistically it's good enough for the majority of uses.  If you're a heavy user don't expect to get more than 4 hours out of it.- Backlight keyboard alone does not seem to have very much impact on the battery.  This was a worry for some, it really does not make that much of a difference on the battery at all, to my pleasant surprise.- More, faster RAM included this time around.  This is important for application multitasking.  I don't like that it's soldered on again, but I give them a pass due to the 4GB being standard on the base 13" unlike last year's debacle.So why'd I knock it down a star?Well...in all fairness, there's absolutely no logical reason that Apple should have ignored USB 3.0 by now.  Even accounting for the addition of the Thunderbolt port, the reality is that USB 3.0 being backwards compatible with 2.0 makes it the best future proofing choice for computers, and one that all competitors have made.  Apple refusing to jump on board is going to hurt their chances of pushing units.  They'll sell a lot of machines as always, but there will come a breaking point.  Even if they wanted to push Thunderbolt harder, it would not have harmed them financially or competitively to include at least one USB 3.0 port.Also, I wasn't really impressed with the quality of the screen.  There's just something...off...about the screen.  It's hard to put into words.  But it just doesn't have that same visual presence as the Pro, or even the 2010 Air.  My understanding is that the panel type has been changed, likely causing this phenomenon.  There's pixelation in places, and the text doesn't have the same clarity as with the Pro line.  There were some compromises here.  For day-to-day usage it's not a deal breaker, but it's noticeable and thus I note it here.  Don't expect "magical" screen quality.  If the screen quality all around matters and you have a keen eye like me, go for a Pro.Battery life is also quite finicky.  I know it's rated at "up to 7 hours" but I want to stress that this is under EXTREMELY conservative use cases.  I'm talking Safari only, no flash, low backlight keyboard, low screen brightness.  On the plane when they dimmed the cabin lights, I was able to go to one notch on the screen and backlight, which let me see perfectly, and then it lasted quite well.  But here at home, with the screen brightness at just over halfway, running Mail, Firefox and Safari (because right now Safari is the default browser for Mail links), I'm hovering around 5 hours, which isn't bad.  Yet if Spotlight gets fired up and indexing, I watched in horror as that figure went down to 2 hours under the same conditions.Lastly, I am compelled to knock them for their refusal to at least include a USB restore drive in the box.  I know they're pushing downloads and streaming media, but the reality is that physical media for computer restoration is almost a necessity.  The novelty of an internet-based reinstall is nice, and they can keep that, but I still say that they should have included the Lion OS on a USB drive like they did with the 2010.  The additional cost is pennies for that drive, so cost isn't the reason.  They're pushing an agenda, and I don't like being tethered to the internet if and when I need to reinstall my operating system.  There is a hidden recovery partition for this purpose that you can also use.  But I think Apple is missing the boat here.  What if the drive itself, the physical drive, goes toast?  You're stuck unless you pay money.  Thus the value of having external media for restoration if and when that were to happen.  The SSD bar in the Air is replaceable, and there are already options from OWC for those users.  But it's useless unless you pay $30 to download Lion and burn it/write it yourself or pay Apple $70 for a USB stick with Lion on it.  To me both are unacceptable alternatives for something that should be in the box of every computer.-_- Mac OS X 10.7, CODE NAME LION -_-I want to interject here and state for the record that the majority of what bothers me with this purchase really has more to do with Lion, the newest operating system from the Apple, rather than the Air hardware itself.  Based on my experience, the Lion OS is a step in the wrong direction.  Apple is attempting to blend what we know of Mac OS with what certain users know of iOS, and the output is a very clunky experience at times.  They introduced plenty of new features, and changed some tried and true features at the same time.  It's clear they are attempting to create a single OS for both tablets and the desktop OS, but it's just...wrong.Apple introduced a new feature, Mission Control, which is designed to act as the evolution of Exposé and Spaces. The problem is that Mission Control is finicky.  It wants each app to be run in Full Screen to be able to separate them correctly within a single desktop.  However...running apps full screen is a bit of a pain because it disables the Dock.  Thus if you're running Firefox, let's say, in full screen you can't then see the unread count on Mail in the Dock.  This basically forces you to run a Desktop that is just a Desktop and then run other apps in their own Desktop space. If you don't run apps in full screen, Mission Control then just "Paper stacks" them in a very unorganized fashion within the same Desktop.  If an app is minimized into the Dock, it does not show in Mission Control.  This seems bass-ackwards...if it is minimized into the Dock it should be one of the icons on top in Mission Control automatically.  The only way to force this is to manually create the Desktop and assign the app to it, or full screen the app and then switch out of it.I know that's hard to understand, but the bottom line is that the approach isn't very well implemented.Apple has introduced another feature, Launchpad, which is essentially an iPad view of all of the local applications.  It supports the grouping concept also found on iOS.  Anyone who owns an iPod Touch or an iPad/iPhone will instantly recognize this.  The idea is obvious; the concept of it just does not work on a full computer.  It translates on a simple touch interface, but not a computer where you're not really touching.  It should be obvious that the intent is to have one operating system for both desktops and tablets in an attempt to extend iOS beyond its limitations and dumb down the desktop experience.  I get it.  But beyond the obvious issues, there are more functional problems.  Launchpad shows queued up downloads or updates to existing apps rather than the app itself.  So for example, I saw there was an upgrade for iPhoto and started it from the App Store when I was on the plane.  But when I saw it was over 600MB I stopped it.  Problem is that made iPhoto unavailable from Launchpad because it changed to a download prompt instead of the app.  It's not a deal breaker, as one could go to the Applications folder by exiting Launchpad or not using it, but it's something to note...Apple's got some work to do."Natural scrolling" is a joke.  It turns over 20 years of computing on its head and not in a good way.  I turned that stuff off the moment I saw it.  For those that don't know what this is, Apple has set the default scroll behavior to where the window will scroll in the same direction as where you scroll your fingers/mouse.  So for example, right now if you scroll a window down, the the page will go up so you read down the page.  That's logical.  In the default scroll of Lion, if you do the same downward scroll, the page will move down.  So if you want to read towards the bottom like normal people, you would scroll up, because you're "pulling the page up" in order to read downwards.  If it sounds confusing, it is.  I disabled this immediately.Those who are on the fence about this, think of this way.  If I asked you to get to the bottom of the stairs, what direction are you moving?  DOWN.  Down = Bottom.  That's logical, right?  So when looking at a piece of paper, if I wanted to go to the bottom of the page, I am reading DOWN the page. The analogy I stated before of "move the paper up to read downwards" works if my hands are directly on the paper.  But when I am not touching the paper, my eyes go down; the paper itself, say if laying on table, goes up.  That's why computer-based scrolling has worked for over two decades.  It's designed to work for your eyes, not for your hands."Natural scrolling" makes perfect sense on an iPad, because you're "touching the paper" directly, thus you would move the paper so that you can get to the next parts of what you're reading.  I didn't find it to translate well on a disconnected input medium like the trackpad at all.  Your Mileage May Vary, but in my opinion it's more clunky than it's worth, and I would rather it had been disabled by default, with options for users who want to try that input type that are converts from the iPad.Lion wants to remember open tabs by default in Safari.  So let's say you have 3 tabs open and you shut the browser down because you're finished.  In my mind if I close all three tabs it's because I'm done using them and the next time I open the browser I expect a clean slate; otherwise I would just use bookmarks. In Lion, by default, when you open the browser multiple times, it will reopen whatever tabs you had open the last time you ran it.  Even Reset Safari does not stop this behavior.  You have to disable it in System Preferences if you don't want it.Lion has taken a questionable direction with regards to design strategy.  It feels very much like Apple's strategy was to create an OS that could be used on both a computer and a tablet, and I'd be shocked if we didn't see a Lion version of the iPad down the road.  The problem is a lot of the features just don't translate well to a computer environment at all, yet would feel right at home on a tablet.  Things like rotating and the new Mail interface.  I know some people have reported things as bugs with Lion...I don't think they are.  I think a lot of what we are experiencing are intentional changes...and anyone who thinks it's a bug, is really feeling the negative impacts of the changes.  Call a spade a spade.In summary...do I recommend it?  That's a big YES.  The 2011 Air is a solid machine that IMO is hindered somewhat by a questionable OS design.  The hardware is spot on and what the Air really should have been in the 2010 revision.  The backlight keyboard adds significant value to the Air, and the 2011 just feels right.  The base 13" is a great value and well worth the money you spend on it.  It's not going to replace a Pro for many reasons.  But it's strong enough to be someone's primary if they really want it to be.  The review may sound like it's lower than a 4, but the more critical negatives are with Lion, not with the Air itself.  The Air itself is rock solid.  It's a strong VALUE and well worth the dollars you spend on it.  The higher end 13" is pushing it in terms of true value, as is the low end 11", but the high end 11" and the base 13" both are the best values in the Apple lineup right now.  The 13" Pro has a stronger processor but not by much, and you must add a SSD to make it slightly superior to the base Air.  That's the way it should have been from the get-go.  VALUE, people.  Value.::M.D.C. "Tempting Reviews"::4.0::July 23, 2011
R1FPOM71B0CMHK::Long time PC guy.  Not anymore::I've been a life-long PC user who thought people use Mac's so they can look cool in their pony tails and Patagonia jackets at Starbucks.  So when it was time to upgrade the 'ol Lenovo, the first thing I did was go to the PC store in our mall and look at the new PC's.  And there are lots of really cool ones.  I really liked the Sony Viao in particular.  Then I went to the Apple store and looked at the Mac's...and there is no comparison in terms of the actual physical machine.  The Apple is just much, much better built.  I was still about 90% sure I'd go PC though, because it's the software I'm worried about.  But since I was still a month or so out from the buy, I started asking people who looked more like me (you know...boring), at Starbucks and elsewhere, what they thought of their Mac.  100% of them loved them.  100%.  As in every...single...person.  It was universal. People who just switched, people who switched a while back, and people who have had only Apple ALL loved them.  I couldn't find a single person to complain.So I bought one.  And I love it.  Everything about it.  The only error message I've gotten on my MAC is from, you guessed it, the ONE Microsoft program I run (Office for Mac, which actually works well).  So here's the deal: the Mac just works.  It does everything well, and it's very intuitive.  I had a friend who switched tell me "if you can't figure out how to do something on your Mac, just sit back and think how a 10 year old would do it".  And he was right.  I was trying to move a bunch of pictures and getting frustrated because holding down shift and selecting images wasn't working.  I sat back and thought about it, then instantly figured it out.  You just slide over the pictures you want.  That's it.  There's no ctrl/alt/shift/f5 crap on a Mac.  There are no "This program performed an illegal operation and will shut down" warnings. No "Fatal exception occurred" messages that make you freak out that your hard drive just crashed.  Nothing like that.  When I turn it on, it fires up in about 10 seconds, and re-loads everything that was running when I shut it down.  They tell me that's because of the flash memory, but I just know it's awesome.I set mine up with a second monitor (not the Apple one for $1,200, I bought a Samsung for cheap), and it's awesome, I can have different stuff running on both screens.  Took about 30 seconds to learn.I can honestly say the ONLY thing I like better on the PC is how you can Explore for files.  On the Mac its called the "finder", and it's not as good.  But that's it IMO.I use my computer for basic office stuff, no programming, no heavy graphics, no gaming.  For personal use, it's web surfing and pictures.  I can't speak for the heavier uses, but for an everyday guy who travels for work and is on the computer all day, this thing rocks.  If you are worried about memory, buy a USB drive, you can get one for next to nothing now.The Mac is tiny, fast, reliable, and has great battery life.  I couldn't give it higher praise for the way I use a computer.  In fact, maybe I should grow a pony tail....::Chris R. Hotz "Real reviews.  No fake 5-star"::5.0::January 31, 2012
R19KE8KALCQM94::Absolutely love it::It's not perfect everybody knows that. Nothing in this world is perfect, but sometimes you just find something that just works for you. This computer just works for me.- I bike everywhere I go, even though I have a car, because it's fun. The thing about biking everywhere and leaving your house for the whole day is packing everything into your one bag. The MBA packs really really well leaving you PLENTY of space for everything else.-I multi-task a lot and the new Lion capabilities of full screen applications let's me do that even more. Going between the 5-10 PDF's and reading them is very easy using Lion's Gesture control and running . The upgrade to a standard of 4GB of RAM from 2GB was an absolute necessity because I am constantly using at least 3GB of RAM or higher while working.-I've never owned an Apple laptop and I love the light up keyboard. It's great because I tend to study late.-It pretty much does everything you want to do of the basics and can even handle HD Netflix streaming, but it does start up the fan into high gear and heats up the computer, but that's the only time it ever does. 95% of the time it runs silent (and I mean absolutely silent because that was a pet peeve of mine from my older laptops) making me love this thing even more.There are way more in depth reviews around here so I won't try to be an expert. Just as a regular person and student doing regular things, this computer does all you need. I don't play Games and I don't do video editing or complicated photoshop stuff on a day to day basis so this works great as my daily driver. I also say this from laptop experience.-I bought an Asus netbook and hated it because it was loud, heavy for its size, clunky, awkward, and shut down on me at random times. I eventually sold that thing on craigslist.-I owned a CR-48 (original chromebook) and the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook and realized I wasn't going to be able to multitask the way I wanted and it was still too much to carry on my back and bike with.I eventually just decided I was going to wait for this laptop and hope for the best. I got the best I could hope for and I love it.::S. Spediacci "Rowing is Life"::4.0::August 31, 2011
R2MSYI45XOU5EX::Powerful Features, Casual Interface::As a user interface enthusiast, I feel that a computer should be bought first based on the interface and second based on performance.  Luckily the Macbook Air 13" beats my expectations on both fronts.This Macbook Air was clearly made for Mac OS 10.7 Lion.  Having used Lion on an older computer without one of Apple's new multi-touch trackpads, I originally thought it wasn't a very big upgrade, but this MacBook Air proved my original thoughts wrong.  It still retains all of the power of Snow Leopard, and adds some new functionality too, while making everything seem much more casual and personal.  Four finger swipes between spaces and full screen apps is the best way to go about a handful of tasks at once.  Mission Control can quickly organize the most cluttered workspace.  There are also tons of nice little features that really make the computing experience seem much more natural and refined.  Over time, you'll start spotting small differences that really make a big impact in usability like being able to zoom into webpages in safari, holding down a letter on the keyboard to bring up accents, and letting Quick Look run in the background.The immediacy and intimacy of apple's iOS operating system has been brought over, making simple tasks like checking email, browsing the web, or writing a document feel much less constricted.  All of these things, of course, get the benefit of a bigger screen and a full qwerty keyboard.My first thing that struck me about the computer physically was just how compact it was.  Even now, whenever I pick it up or plug in a cable, I'm surprised about how much they could fit in such a tiny body.  Of course, there are some sacrifices to make it this thin, but nothing that has really bothered me too much.  No optical disk drive (more on that later), no firewire, no HD FaceTime camera, no external battery indicator...  These are all things found on the MacBook Pro line, but are absent from the Air and aren't horribly missed.  One concession that might bug people is in the keyboard.  Although it's backlight (which is much more useful than it sounds), the travel of the keys in about half of that found in traditional MacBook keyboards.  It bugged me a bit at first, but after just a few days it wasn't really an issue anymore, but if you're still on the fence, it's one thing to keep in mind.One thing to note is that if you're looking for a day to day computer, the 11 inch macbook air will probably feel a bit claustrophobic to most.  The 13 inch screen is definitely a breath of fresh air for me because feels much larger than it actually is.  Having used a 13 inch white plastic macbook for the past 4 years, I expected the screen to be similar, but in use, it's vastly better.  Colors look brighter and blacks look deeper, but the big difference is in the display's pixel density.  The 13 inch Air ships with a 1440x900 resolution screen, matching the 15 inch macbook pro pixel for pixel, but at a smaller size.  This makes texts and graphics look much crisper.  I've found that the interface in general has much more room to breathe than on the 1280x800 resolution screen found on previous 13 inch MacBooks and the current line of 13 inch MacBook Pros.Someone looking for great connectivity features might want to look at the MacBook Pro line as the MacBook Air has only two USB ports, and SD Card Reader, Thunderbolt port, and auxiliary in/out.  However, I've been surprised at how little I really miss the CD Drive.  If you're already seriously considering this computer, it's omission shouldn't be too much of an issue, especially if you share files mostly through SD cards, flash drives, or emails.  Of course, a $79 Apple CD Drive can be purchased and plugged in if you really need it.  It's definitely a good idea to get one now if this is going to be your only computer, but since the world seems to be going further away from physical media towards downloads exclusively, I could see that CD drive collecting dust a few years down the road.  I'd also like to note that wifi performance has been stellar so far, being able to pick up a stronger signal in most places than my phone or previous computer.Inside in Air is 256gb of flash memory and a Core i5 ULV processor, making the computer feel quick and zippy.  After Effects and Illustrator, two extremely large and intensive applications, boot up with unbelievable speed.  If you're going to use this just for light tasks and small applications, this computer packs more speed and power than you'll ever need.  Even if you're into more intensive applications, you'll still be pleasantly surprised by the performance.  While it's clearly no super computer, anyone who casually likes to play with the Adobe Suite, even monsters in it like After Effects or Photoshop, won't be upset.  As expected, rendering takes a while, but any slowdowns you might encounter aren't enough, for me at least, to get frustrated with the computer.  I've yet to experience an app crash, even Adobe After Effects, which used to force quit every time I tried to close a composition on my old MacBook.The Air feels like an obvious extension of both the established Mac line as well as iOS. When I had an old baseline MacBook, I couldn't imagine living without an iPad for simple tasks, because the old computing experience was so restricted and confined, but after using the 13 inch air with all of its OS X Lion glory, I completely understand why people wouldn't want something between a computer and smartphone.  Using the MacBook Air is the first time I've felt as engrossed into a desktop interface as I have with an iPad.  Everything about it feels more fluid and comfortable than any other full computer I've ever used.  When Apple announced the new MacBook Airs and killed the white plastic MacBooks, I was really confused, but now I fully understand their actions.  The white plastic MacBooks were the cheapest computers they sold that could do everything the average consumer wanted.  People bought them because they could do a lot for less, but with the matching price point of the MacBook Airs, they suddenly have much less appeal.  The great specs and power of the MacBook Air prove Apple's commitment to quality across all levels as it takes the position as the cheapest MacBook.  The MacBook Air is the first computer I've used that does everything I need it to and disappears when I'm using it so I can focus on what I'm doing.  Overall, the MacBook Air is a strong choice for anyone looking for a computer to use day to day and maybe even for a bit of serious computing.  Although in the future, it might be reflected upon as a transitory device in the convergence of iOS and Mac OS, right now it feels like the perfect combination of the two.  It's both comfortable in use and powerful, making the entire experience feel "just right."::Daniel Lipson::5.0::October 21, 2011
R2B63CWTLEDSE8::One laptop to RULE them all::Hello, this review is about my preciousss... MacBook Air 13 256gb (2011).I have been using Thinkpad laptops for the past 10 years.  My last one was a T410s.  It was mediocre.  This is my first Apple laptop, and I'm now a believer.  I've had this machine for over a month.I carry this around with me almost every day in my Booq bag.  I installed Windows 7 Ultimate via Boot Camp, which works great.  I now use Mac OSX Lion about 80% of the time, and Windows 7 20%.What I love about this MacBook Air:-- awesome battery life, at least 6 hours.  I've never run out of power.  I don't even carry around my power cord.  Just make sure to charge the laptop every night.-- OSX Lion.  There are so many features that you cannot get in Windows:  the multi-touch gestures, buttery smooth pinch-to-zoom in Safari, multiple desktops, and full-screen applications.-- excellent LCD quality.  The bottom right of my screen had some uneven lighting issues when I first got the laptop.  I guess that the problem was that the glue needed to settle.  After 1 week, the lighting became more even.-- 256gb SSD is more than enough space.  I partitioned 80gb for Windows 7, which I'm using to write this review.-- very quiet.  Goodbye, spinning hard drive! I guess that the heat management is pretty good because the fans rarely turn on in OSX.  In Windows 7, the fans can kick in when I have 2 Chrome windows open with about 12 tabs open, including espn.com.-- adjustable keyboard backlight.  I can type like 85 wpm and I infrequently look at the keyboard.  I like how I can turn off the keyboard backlight, or change its brightness between about 15 levels.Change requests:-- upgrade USB ports to the 3.0 standard-- that's about it for the hardware.  For the software, sure there are features and minor bugs that can get fixed in OSX.  But this review is mainly about the hardware, and it is nearly a flawless victory.SO... should I get THIS one, or the teeny tiny, cutsey wootsy 11 inch laptop?-- Dudes:  get the 13 inch laptop. Why?  the battery life and screen real estate (higher resolution)-- Ladies:  whatever you prefer.Summary:From the perspective of a salaried, college-educated guy who used Thinkpads for 10 years, I highly recommend getting this MacBook Air.  I give it a 5/5.  Everything works, and you can use Windows if you want to.  But give OSX at least 1 week, and I think that you'll see that it's far superior to Windows for everyday tasks.UPDATE, Oct. 10My friend who weighs about 165 lbs accidentally stepped on my Booq bag.  The dude stepped on the side that had my precious.  In my mind, I was like "precoussss!"  But it was during church service, and I waited until the end of service to check if there was any damage.  I opened the lid and saw that there was... no damage.HAHA, too bad clumsy foot!  Precious wins!::Albert Youn "Technical Recruiter"::5.0::September 29, 2011
R2XH2JJBST656E::Read this before buying (Updated June 2012)::I come back to this review with a bit more of information that I hope you might find useful.There are rumors that Apple will launch a cheaper and faster variant of this laptop on the third quarter of 2012, so if you can bear the wait, I predict it will probably be worth it.The Intel HD3000 integrated graphics card NEEDS to be upgraded for todays standards, this laptop heats up when playing HD video. Intel's Ivy Bridge HD4000 card is better and will probably come with the next version of this laptop.________________________This computer is built for a specific type of customer, so please make sure you fit the profile before buying it.Ask yourself these questions:1. Do you find yourself playing video games on your laptop?2. Do you use CPU-intensive programs such as iMovie or Handbreak?If your answers are yes, I strongly encourage you to but a 13' Macbook Pro. Alternatively, you can wait for next year's Ivy Bridge line of Macbook Airs, which will deliver better graphics.Now, if you work on your computer, if you go to college (like I do) and only need it to take notes, Skype, watch some videos, make documents and presentations and manage spreadsheets, this laptop is for you. I do encourage you to keep all your media on an external hard drive, because iTunes can fill up that 128 GB drive pretty fast.Pros:· 4 or 5 hours of battery use.· Fast, because it uses a solid state hard drive instead of a normal disk one.· OS X 10.7.2 is by far the most intuitive user interface I have graced my eyes upon.· 15' Macbook Pro resolution, meaning you have more pixels on a smaller screen, which is always great.· It CAN run taxing programs, but don't expect the greatest performance.· Trackpad and keyboard are the greatest I've seen.· Great for programs like Evernote and Word.Cons:· Heat, but you won't notice it that much, really.Final verdict:Make sure you are a person that won't find the graphic performance a hazard.I came from a Toshiba core i7 with 8GB of RAM and 512 of nVidia VRAm, and let me tell you that changing was the greatest idea I've had this whole year.::Julio R. Corzo M::5.0::December 14, 2011
R11DUFKZ5VSIZM::GREAT SOUND, GREAT SPEED, GREAT DESIGN, AVERAGE BATTERY::The most beautiful thing about this laptop is obviously how thin it is. It weighs maybe 1.3 kgs but it feels like it weighs nothing. Now there's a lotta talk about how the iPad 3 is going to be. Imagine a 13 inch iPad with better speakers, a better screen, a 128GB SSD, a lotta ram and a wonderful back lit keyboard. That is the macbook air. I doubt I will need to upgrade to an iPad 3 just yet when I have the macbook air. I have stopped spending hours with my lovely iPad 2 since I got this beauty, beast and God itself.I have an iMac from 2010 which has a intel core 2 duo at 3.06 GHZ. My macbook air runs at 1.7GHZ but has an i5 dual core processor... What does this mean in terms of actual performance? Well the macbook air takes less than half a minute to load, I never quite shut it down cause when i'm not using it I simply close the lid and that's that.Using a software available for free called Wontube converter, I tried to see which computer converts a 700 mb avi file into an mp4 faster and the laptop did it in roughly 8 minutes where as the computer took 90 seconds more. I think that is phenomenal speed. It is also remarkable the amount of technology that goes into  making a puny machine faster than the desktop.They both cost the same amount so I would really struggle if I had to choose between one. I love the fact that I can carry the AIR wherever I go. Also 120GB was free when I first received it. That is wonderful because I thought it's gonna somewhere around 100 and a few gigs.I can open multiple applications but I'm a little cautious cause it has a direct impact on the battery.It is not seven hours, it never has ran more than four hours. The brightness of the laptop is not as bright as the Macbook pro. Correct me if I'm wrong but using it in anything less than full brightness is not recommended. I  can keep my desktop at 25% less than optimal brightness and function properly but the laptop... I wouldn't.CAMERA - The camera is not good. I wouldn't use it for photo booth and clicking photographs, they appear grainy. My 2007 Dell Inspiron notebook has a better camera.SPEAKERS - Very good loud sound. A little louder than the iPad actually. They are very clear, the headphone jack is situated on the left but I wish it was on the right because if I'm using that and the usb port and the charger all at the same time it gets a little crowded. Anyway, the earphone speaker volume on max isn't that loud.WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY - So far not a single problem. The wireless is very finely tuned I find. It is super active and restless but not once has it given me the slightest hint of an issue at obtaining a signal.BATTERY LIFE - Advertized is seven hours, the maximum I ever get out of it is 180 minutes to about a max of 200 minutes or so.BLUETOOTH - Apple makes for a great generic inbuilt bluetooth and in a matter of a couple of minutes I had my android hooked to this computer and was transferring mp3s to and fro.iTunes - I recently enrolled in Itunes match and this ensures that even a laptop with just 128gigs of HDD has all my music on the go. A downside of itunes match is the fact that it downloads the song before actually streaming it but hey I can live with it when I have a 25k song limit on iTunes match's icloud.Keyboard - It is not a perfect keyboard, the lights seem a little cheesy when they are backlit to about 50%.Weight - Hardly any weight at all and I can hold for it for hours without getting tired. Weighs much less than my ASUS U35F-X1 Thin...let's say it weighs a feather over 2 iPad 2'sPortability - The Macbook Air 13 doesnt heat up like almost all of the Windows laptops I have ever used. Because it doesn't have an optical drive helps the cause but it remains a cool customer  all the time unless I am doing something processor intensive like converting video. But I gotta give it to Apple because their laptops NEVER HEAT.Lion seems to work better on my laptop than on my desktop. One reason for this could be the fact that I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion but nonetheless the desktop is substantially slower (thinking of a clean install..)I use TEXTEDIT for notepad because Apple doesn't have a native notepad.The trackpad is flawless. It is better than any laptop I have ever used.FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER OWNED AN APPLE NOTEBOOK -Let me explain a few things that make an apple laptop stand out from the others.1. No heat on your lap irrespective of what application you're running, it seems cool, the chassis never heats up like numerous laptops I've had in the past2. It's much lighter, Lion loads much faster on the macbook air than any other operating system I have seen load on any other machine I have used3. The magnet end of the charger easily attaches into the charging port on the mac, there is an AMBER light that displays itself when it's charging and it turns GREEN when the Mac has been completely charged.4. Setting up a macbook is easy, Apple doesn't load any bloatware because somehow this company manages to make everything seem genuine and intuitive for software as well. For example, the applications that I never used before like LAUNCH PAD etc seem more convincing on the Macbook Air than any other application a laptop pc manufacturer has loaded on their machines.5. Portability is divine. I do need a great perfect carrying solution though recommendations would be welcome. I do like sleeves but am open to any suggestion as to what others use.6. The screen resolution is optimized, I doubt you will ever change it, the icon spacing is beautiful, the track pad has various shortcuts, go to a store displaying this laptop and tell me you've seen a better looking computer. Watching a youtube video is a fantastic experience because 1080P truly pops out and there is a certain flow of programs which other computers don't have7. 2 USB outlets let you attach extra devices such as optical drive, external hard drive but I wish the HDMI port was something simpler and less "Apple'ized" ... Good luck finding a HDMI cable in India.CONS -The macbook air doesn't have the advertized battery life. I wish it lasted as long as a macbook pro. I hate having to close applications to save the battery. Also decreasing the brightness on this type of a screen makes it dull.  The Macbook pro can take more of a decrease in brightness than this machine can. When you turn the keyboard light all the way back, there is some light that escapes from the bottom and it makes your laptop look a little robotic. Certain businesses don't allow widescale access to INTRANET on wireless and asking for a wireless password is considered almost rude. This makes the absence of the Ethernet port a bit of a debby downer. Yes, you can buy an add on but still...WHY IT HOLDS UP AGAINST THE MACBOOK PRO -1. I don't really need an optical drive, I have a desktop Apple but if this is your only computer then I would consider the macbook pro or maybe an external USB optical drive (sounds odd to me honestly)2. The solid state drive and the i5 are both plenty fast. The boot up time for both machines is the same.3. The track pad, the keyboard, the overall feel is same on both except the macbook pro is heavier4. The macbook pro has a much better outlandish battery life so if that is of a lot of concern I would recommend the 15 inch oddity cause it's beautiful.I have previously owned notebooks by Compaq (running XP) Dell (running Vista and later Windows 7) and I also have an Asus U35F-X1 Thin running Windows 7. The Apple seems to beat them in terms of portability, design, size, performance, etc. I envision greater integration between Apple's operating system for their mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone, iPod (iOS) and their operating system for the desktops and notebooks (Currently Lion) in the future and it only seems believable that the Air will support those formats for a few more years. So the chances of this becoming obsolete are slim. I don't think this is that expensive especially considering just how much of a marvel the machine is. I love browsing the web on it but I need to further probe into keyboard shortcuts. I'm more aware of PC shortcuts than I am of MAC.**UPDATED 03/16**PS - When you connect an HDMI to this laptop using a converter, to transfer the image from the mac to the TV screen simply hold down "Command" and press "F1" - this basically duplicates your image to the tv screen. HDMI works pretty good.::Harkanwar Anand::5.0::February 27, 2012
R1G7R0QZ5RBR6P::Too Fragile - UPDATE - Solution!::UPDATE---(on bottom)Conceptually and on paper, this machine is awesome. After using it for about a month or so, it was still awesome. It is very snappy, and the trackpad is amazing compared to any other trackpad I have used. The display is not perfect (gradient mountains near the edge of the screen due to varying 'tightness' of the bezel), but decent for being on a laptop. They keyboard is backlight, adding value during use at night. Overall, it has been good computing experience.It stopped being awesome though, after I used it for what it is designed to be - portable. If you search on your favorite search engine "2011 MBA - Faint lines", it will be your first hit. If anything presses against the lid of the MBA while closed for an extended period of time, the keyboard will press against the screen - imprinting onto the LCD. This is a common occurrence for those who use a laptop...like a laptop and is honestly unacceptable. After bringing it to the genius bar, a suggestion provided to me is to simply use a hard cover case such that the pressure is applied to the case instead of the MBA lid. While an excellent suggestion, it undermines the purpose of the form factor of the MacBook Air - namely, portability from being extremely lightweight and thin. To travel without without fear, I would have to double the weight and quadruple the thickness.For those travelers out there - this is my warning, and may I also add that my ThinkPad 120xe and Alienware M11X never suffered damage due to being transported.Edit: If you're wondering whether or not this screen issue is a just cause for 1 star - it is. The screen heavily impacts the enjoyability of using the product. If it was just a matter of having a poor quality screen (such as one with very poor color replication), then the rating would have been based on how important I felt screen quality was. However, this is something entirely different - the screen is damaged during what I would consider to be normal and practical usage. As such, it is a design flaw that cripples the entire experience. I will attempt to find and upload a picture of related damage.UPDATE -- (Copy and paste of my review for the Razer Kabuto Screen Protector/Mousepad - refer to the product for a full review, I only copied comments relevant to the MBA)<review for the Kabuto>At first, I was told by the Apple Genius Bar technicians that placing something between the screen and the body would only reduce the clearance, and would do nothing to help with the issue. I decided that it certainly would not hurt (more) - and might even help distribute the pressure a little more evenly across the screen. Worse case,  /wave <$20.To my surprise, the cloth has work VERY well. Since I've used it, the white line issue is practically nonexistent.Now, to review the product:Pros - Thin! - but not TOO thin. I was certainly aware of the thickness of this cloth before I bought it. I chose this one over other (more popular / common) brands because this cloth adds the additional functionality of a mousepad (others are just cloths - I did find one that was a cloth, and a mousepad  - but that one was a tad too thick for the MBA - first hand experience - Everki). It was also 'slightly' thicker. I valued the thickness because I sought to provide more of a 'cushion' between the screen and the body. I deemed other cloths TOO thin.....DISCLAIMER - the fit within the MBA is not a 'perfect' fit. Meaning the lid does not close entirely (it is not a giant gap - but definitely a noticeable one if you care). If you want a cloth that closes entirely, you would want a thinner cloth (Shaggymac, Radtech). For me, the cushion was a requirement - a super thin cloth, in my opinion (it could be completely wrong!), could not protect as well as this cloth.</end of review>WITH this product, I would raise my rating to around 4 ish stars. Unfortunately, the Macbook Air does NOT come with a screen protector cloth, and will be leaving my reviewing of 1 star as a WARNING that a screen protector cloth is NEED - not to prevent scratches (with is the obvious reason why one would want screen protection), but to prevent the 'faint white line.'Good luck!::Minnus::1.0::December 18, 2011
R1Q810YH4R6PYZ::As a college computer science student, this is fantastic.::As a computer scientist who spends a lot of time programming and cares about both the functional and aesthetic qualities of my electronics, the ultrabook craze as of late has excited me a lot. The fact that I have used PCs almost exclusively for the last 12 years initially lead me away from considering a MacBook Air--after all, Apple's computers are expensive; they do have a reputation for all looking the same, acting the same, and being generally uncustomizable; and they have had a reputation for being incompatible with a lot of software out there.  But I found myself in a position where I want a secondary computer that is small, light, attractive, and dedicated for light use, like text editing/coding and recreation.  As it turns out, Apple has done something with this laptop that I never thought I'd dream of.The Macbook Air--*gasp*--is price competitive with its competition.Most comprable Windows ultrabooks, like the ASUS Zenbook UX31E-DH72 13.3-Inch Thin and Light Ultrabook (Silver Aluminum), right now are often only about $100-$200 or so cheaper than the Macbook Air now.  I think that there are many things that the Macbook Air brings to the table that make the premium worthwhile. This review is not going to focus much on the actual specs of the laptop, as you can glean that from any of the 90 5-star reviews this laptop has at the moment.  I will focus instead on why this is great against the competition.1) The user experience is fantastic. The trackpad alone could win me over for this one. For some reason, other laptop manufacturers can't get multitouch gesturing right, but Apple clearly put a ton of effort into something so overlooked--but so constantly used--as the trackpad.  Multitouch gesturing on Lion is just the best you'll find on any computer anywhere. It feels natural and makes navigating your computer effortless. Even ignoring that, I've rarely seen any hiccups while using the laptop in terms of things freezing up or the computer becoming unresponsive. While I do love Windows 7, the benefits of Apple's closed in environment is that they can control everything about the user experience, and so slowdowns and UI problems become a rarity. You really can presume that nearly everything's going to work right. Finally, all the components seem very solidly built. The keyboard has great tactile feedback, and the port selection, while limited, all works perfectly. The hinge of the laptop even clearly was thought about, as the resistance is pretty much ideal (no wobbling, but not difficult to move around). The screen resolution (1440x900)--while not as good as the Asus Zenbook--is better than most of the rest of the competition, and that's something that's important to me as a software developer since I like to be able to read documentation and type out code at the same time, a feat difficult on a low-resolution screen.2) The customer service is also great. AppleCare has a great reputation, and you get it for a year for free. I've used ASUS support before, and it's really, really annoying to have to wait a month without your laptop for service. There really isn't much comparison.3) As a software developer, I find it irking that Apple forces iOS developers to code on a Mac with a subscription fee to the SDK. But that's the nature of the beast--so having this laptop gives me the ability to do just that. Sure, it seems unfair and maybe I ought not develop for iOS because of the many subversive choices Apple made, but hey--it's not up to me, and it's easier and more stable than making my laptop into a Hackintosh, so I guess I'll play the game :PAnd finally, there are some complaints about heat. Using the laptop on your lap does make your legs feel pretty warm. I haven't had the laptop crash due to heat ever, though. It is to be expected, though, since the metal chassis is part of the laptop's cooling system, though I hope that in future revisions of the macbook they come up with a good way to avoid this issue.There's one other laptop that I haven't taken into consideration that in retrospect I wish I considered more seriously. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 (129126U) 13.3" LED Notebook - Core i5 i5-2520M 2.50GHz - 4G DDR3 320G HDD (Windows 7 Professional) - Black is a pretty good, and overlooked, ultrabook that seems like a great alternative, especially considering that you can get an extended battery that brings the battery life of that beast to an inhumane 22 hours or so while still being pretty small and light.  If you're looking into high-end ultrabooks, I'd limit my search to the Macbook Air, the Asus Zenbook, or the Thinkpad X1 at this point (the Sony VAIO VPC-Z212GX/B 13.1-Inch Laptop (Black) is very cool too, but also too expensive for me to take seriously). Also, you may want to wait for the near future when one of two things happens: a) the new Intel "Ivy Bridge" chips come out, as this may make laptops have even better performance and battery life; and b) Windows 8 comes out--I think that Microsoft's latest revision to their OS may have the potential for changing things big time in the market, so unless you feel good about Apple as it stands, I would consider waiting for that to come along.Hopefully this review will help some of you in the search for the latest and coolest laptops around :) Let the best manufacturer/operating system win!::Omar Diab "Sebastian"::5.0::February 2, 2012
R2O74X4FL6W96C::WOW- just amazing.::I have traditionally been a 13" Macbook Pro user since they have been the most fully outfitted laptops in Apple's line-up. When the AIr came out a few years ago, I remember thinking that I really liked the idea of an ultra portable, but was worried about the lost functionality that came along with it (ethernet port, fire wires, optical drive). Since then my usage has changed a lot. I print and connect to the internet wirelessly, so the ethernet port does not matter anymore. All of my software is downloaded (legally of course) and I have not needed to burn a CD or DVD in 3-4 years, thus the optical drive issue is gone. This latter point matters because I use flash drives to move large files and anything up to 15MB I just e-mail. Port issues aside, there is a lot to recommend the Air over a 13" Pro. The air's screen is less reflective and higher resolution. To my eyes it's just better. The air is light. I never thought a 13" Pro was heavy until I used an Air for a bit. The Air is faster in day-to-day usage than the 13" pro. Both use i5 processors, the same GPU and have 4GB of RAM. The kicker is the flash-based drive in the AIr is WAAAAY faster than the regular HD int he 13" Pro. Side by side, I think the air is the way to go. If you really must have an optical drive, you can sync the Air up to another Mac and use its drive or Apple sells one for $80, but before you buy one, try the Air on its own and you might just be surprised about how well you get along without it. Note: The 15 an 17 inch Pro have much more sophisticated graphics processing and for those needing the extra GPU power, neither the Air nor the 13" Pro is the best choice. I mention this because my review compares the 13" Pro to the Air only.::Ryan H. Smith::5.0::April 30, 2012
R11XYTQCM68HTM::PC guy for 25 years turns to the dark side::So for the last 25 years I've been using PC's. From my 4mhz 8088 PC clone with 2x 360k floppy drives and 512k of RAM with a monochrome screen to my current desktop PC which is a 6-core, 16 gig ram, RAID-0, RAID-1, NVIDIA 560ti video with 1gig RAM and 2x 24" monitors. I had never considered a Mac previously and always considered them to be nothing but overpriced PC's in a shiny case built and designed for computer illiterate individuals seeking a point-and-click appliance. How could I have been so wrong?This laptop is simply the best product I've ever purchased, period. My head, being in the PC world, couldn't even comprehend how elegant and wonderful this laptop could possibly be. I had no frame of reference for a "GREAT product" because, coming from the PC world, I had never experienced that. EVERY laptop I have previously owned or used had something that was sub-par. Sure, 90% of other laptops are good, but they always leave something to be desired. For instance the track pad might be finicky, or the keyboard design may be sub-par, or the built-in speakers aren't loud enough, or the machine is heavy, or noisy, etc. There is nothing sub-par on this machine.- The thing is as light as a feather- Battery lasts 7hrs- Battery charges quickly- Track pad is the best thing I've ever used- Keyboard is shockingly usable and prevents errors, it's a joy to type on- Screen is bright, vibrant, and beautiful- It doesn't get hot- I never hear any fans or anything... maybe 2x's since I've gotten it has it used it's fans- Web cam is great, high res, and works flawlessly- Speakers sound great- Even the power cord is brilliantly designed... and that's just the hardware.OSX, being now based on UNIX, is a dream come true. It makes doing every-day computer tasks a breeze and as simple as point and click. BUT, never fear, you have the full power of UNIX under the hood so if you want to get deep, you absolutely can. I had wrongly ASSumed that OSX was for dummies. Again, I couldn't be more wrong. Within hours I had my macports repository set up and was sucking down Nmap, GTK+, and all sorts of things I would do on my Ubuntu box. I was running Python scripts, writing scripts, running ifconfig... it was great!Oh, so then I decided to fire up Eclipse and try debugging some Android code. After installing Eclipse I tried to fire it up and when I did it complained about not having a Java SDK installed. "Great, let the nightmare begin", I thought to myself. Not so fast! My Mac popped up a window that said, "Oh, hai! I see you don't have the proper Java SDK to run Eclipse, lemme go get that ish for you, cool?". Stunned, I pressed OK, and it went out, got the proper SDK, installed it, and re-launched Eclipse all ready to do. Let me just say the Eclipse install on a PC is... shall I say, slightly more involved.I grabbed my Galaxy S phone, plugged it into my laptop and VIOLA! It just worked! No endless driver installations, no driver conflicts, etc. It was great. So then, just for kicks, I unplugged my Galaxy S, plugged in my Galaxy Nexus and guess what? No drivers necessary, it just worked! Amazing.Another thing that surprised me about OSX was the apps. Everything about them. They are abundant, beautiful, and feature rich. Many of the cross platform apps such as Skype are far superior on the Mac. Not to mention that the apps that aren't free, such as Keynote (Apple's version of PowerPoint), are dirt cheap. Keynote was $19.99 and in my brief experience of crafting a 30 minute slide presentation, far superior to PowerPoint.I've seen the light. Trust me, I didn't want to, but it's impossible to ignore. I'm a convert. I don't think I'll ever buy another PC again, unless it's for gaming.::Eric Maxwell::5.0::April 9, 2012
R366CF267HRKUT::Macbook Air: A different perspective::I purchased this directly from the Apple store and not from Amazon.com. I have owned the product for about two weeks.I will try to avoid repeating what has already been said in many of the other reviews for the Macbook Air and offer you my own perspective and decision-making process before the purchase and thoughts after the purchase.Before I purchased...I have been a long time Windows OS user and really the only Apple product I owned up until this purchase was my iPhone4. I had plenty of desktops at home and work, but I needed a new personal laptop I could take with me when I'm on the go. I would like to think I'm in the majority when it comes to having a very usable laptop that's also portable. It doesn't need to do intense gaming, it doesn't need the best graphics card out there, but it DOES need to be light and it DOES need to do daily tasks well.I researched...I certainly wasn't in the Apple camp just yet and looked at several notebooks from HP, Samsung, Toshiba, Lenovo. I looked at all notebooks, but something about the thin and light ones just really caught my attention. I wanted to be careful though because in the world of technology there are always trade offs. To my relief it appeared that the thin and light notebooks out in the market had all gotten to a point where they were now very capable machines. They were certainly not up to the performance of their thicker brethren, but they were now considered very usable with a price premium that was still within budget. (See the complaints about the first generation thin notebookes like the original Macbook Air if you want to know more about some downsides).Thin and light...The final contenders in the running were the Samsung 9, the Lenovo X1, and this Macbook Air. If you looked at price and performance they're on a level playing field. As the typical consumer though we tend to evaluate beyond just the speeds and feeds. It came down to aesthetics and feeling around the brand. Long story short, Apple won. The OS was not an issue for me because there are several ways you can set your Macbook up to run Windows.The kicker...I would be traveling internationally and Apple clearly offers an international warranty. You can take them to any Apple store to get them fixed. It was not clear what kind of "limited" international warranty were being offered by other manufacturers. I have noticed international warranties are usually NOT standard on typical consumer PCs. Business PCs are another story.After I purchased...Everything works well and the notebook is as speedy as everyone says. There are certainly little things I noticed here after I got this computer.I did try some light 3D gaming and the laptop would get hot especially near the upper part of the keyboard.The large trackpad is easy to use and the surface is a very nice anti-friction material. You would be surprised how many laptop manufacturers get the trackpad surface wrong. The ability for it to recognize a finger vs. your palm resting on it while typing on the keyboard is one of those little features many don't notice.The magsafe adapter is a great design and still beats the traditional plug-in power because there is no harm down if you accidentally pull it out by say tripping over the wire.The power adapter is tiny and doesn't get warm. It also comes with an interchangeable extension cord if the default cord is too short for you.OS X Lion has taken some time to get used to, but it wasn't terrible. I did not end up installing Windows :).The one thing I have NOT liked about the Macbook Air though is that for some reason the notebook screen puts more stress on my eyes than other screens. I can not pinpoint exactly why, but it happens.Conclusion: I gave it 4 stars because I have only had it for a few weeks, but if this notebook lasts me past the warranty period it deserves a at least a 4.5 rating.::DSO::4.0::October 16, 2011
R39QVZ4ZL7IOJ0::Simply amazing!  Best Apple laptop to date!::Although I was thinking of making a "summarized" review, I think this product really deserves a thorough go through.  Just to let you know, I switched over to Mac a little less than 2 years ago, and since then I've had 3 Macbook Pro's and a 27 inch iMac.  As of the purchase of this item I had the 2011 13 inch MB Pro with their 2.8 GHz processor, plus the 2010 27 inch iMac.  Both have memory and HD upgrades.  With this in place, let me get into details:1. Fit and finish, weight, look and feel - Without a doubt this is simply put the best laptop Apple has gotten out in this sense, period.  The machine is significantly lighter than a MacBook Pro, which is a plus being a frequent flier and having to put this on my shoulder along with various cables, an iPad, an iPod and small documents.  The look is all Apple, brushed aluminum with the light up Apple in the middle...  The only down side I've found to Apple's laptops is that they do dent quite easily.  I found this out the hard way since with my previous MB Pro I left the internal zipper in my laptop case not fully closed, and the pressure with alot of documents inside literally made a small ding on my top cover (backside of the screen).  Unfortunately no spare parts to replace this, and repairing would've meant replacing the entire top panel (including the LCD screen) for over $800.2. Features - Again, this machine gets top marks, but does have its drawbacks.  Firstly, the 2011 Airs now have backlit keyboards (again) which is a plus if you work in low light conditions (in my case, on a plane at night).  The computer includes an HD webcam (Facetime camera) which again if you travel and a friend or loved one has one of the more recent Macs or iDevices (iPhone 4, iPad2) you can do videocalls using Apple's facetime feature at no cost and with minimal setup.  Display is not edge to edge like on Macbook Pros, which is a bummer, but it's not noticable if you're coming from another Air or a Windows PC.  As to connectivity, computer has an SD card slot, a Thunderbolt port and 2 USB 2.0 inputs...  And that's it.  This means that everything you have to connect will basically be via a USB.  Therefore, if you need a wired network connection, buy an adapter and take up a USB port...  Need to read a CD or DVD, buy an external Superdrive and connect to a USB port...  This means that you will surely have to purchase a USB hub (if you use external drives you will surely have to purchase a powered hub), so all of this eventually adds up in price.3. OS - For those which use Snow Leopard, Lion is definitely an important step forward in the right direction.  If you don't but already use an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad, many things will seem familiar.  Lion now uses gestures, which basically allows you to use multiple fingers to swipe or move in a direction on your trackpad to do certain items.  I won't go into great detail here but items such as Mission Control and Launchpad are definitely impressive and very user friendly, although many hardcore users will not find themselves using it too much.4. Performance - OK, here's where I leave the best for last.  To be honest, I'm reviewing my Macbook Air I purchased for my wife, since my original plans were not to "downgrade" to the air from a Macbook Pro.  For those of you who don't know, Airs use SSD drives.  In short, this means they are enormous USB pen drives.  The result of this is much lower power consumption, no need to power off the computer when moving it (SSD's have no moving parts, so there's no risk of damaging your hard drive due to motion shock) and the two most important things... very little probability of data loss due to hard drive failure and IMPRESSIVE SPEED!  Although the Air has a lower processor speed than the Pro, the SSD more than makes up for this for common tasks (combined with Lion's efficiency).  From the time I press the power button on the laptop to the moment I get my logon screen... 8 seconds!  To the moment I type in my logon credential to the time the computer is ready to go (with all background processes loaded including antiviruses and indexing programs) 5 seconds!!  I use the Air for virtualization (running windows within my Mac OS) and it is quite fast and responsive for basic tasks, and I also use it for some minor flash animation and other general tasks, and the computer has not disappointed at all.  The only part I have specifically seen a drop in performance versus the Pro is when working with video, such as converting files from one format to another to sync with my iPad.  Otherwise stellar marks.5. Upgradability - Unfortunately, here the Air gets a failing grade.  Basically how you buy the maching is how you will have it.  No options to upgrade RAM or HD (soldered to the motherboard and in the case of the SSD it's an Apple proprietary design) so this has made me have to be creative in cleaning out all of my "non frequently used files" off my laptop since the HD maxes out at 256 GB.  An external HD is a must for photos, movies and music if you have a decent sized collection.So in short, after working a couple of days with my wife's air, I was so impressed that I sold my Pro and purchased one for myself.  Although I don't do my heaviest work on it (I have my iMac for that) it is spectacular for everyday office use and even some heavier than usual lifting...  Definitely something worth buying!::H. Sole::5.0::August 22, 2011
RVHO5MN6QEXLQ::Apple finally got it right...::Finally took the plunge and bought a Mac. Been waiting for the updated MBA and now that it's out, it does not disappoint. I will not get into reiterating features but instead just make a few observations from the perspective of a 20 year PC user who just bought his first Mac today.1) Been using it about 4 hours straight on my lap and doesn't generate nearly the same heat as a Windows laptop. Makes me wonder where all the heat IS going though....2) New gestures and trackpad features on scroll pad are extremely intuitive. I did make one change from default which was to make the bottom right the secondary click. Especially love the 4 finger up-scroll for the dashboard and mission control. Really eliminates the need for a mouse. And Natural Scrolling takes about 15 min to get used to... honestly.3) A previous reviewer wrote that the graphics don't "pop" off the screen and I tend to agree. Even though resolution is increased, was expecting a little more. I think the biggest problem is with the text - doesn't seem clear in some settings. I sure hope Apple has an update for this. On the good side, the new 1440 x 900 resolution is wonderful. Not quite 16 x 9 ratio but pretty darn close and you get a ton of text to fit on the screen.4) This laptop really does feel unbelievably thin and light. We know the specs but when its in your hands, its a different story and Apple hit the mark here.5) SSD drive is instant on and super fast. This boots up and wakes faster than any computer I've ever owned by a LONG shot (I boot up in less than 10 seconds). 128 GB is more than enough for everyday use IMO. Buy an external drive if you need more. The 128GB 13" model is the best value IMO.6) Viewing angles great side to side not so great vertically, but not too relevant anyway on a laptop IMO.7) A little surprised that we didn't get an HD FaceTime camera but just SD. I guess sacrifices had to be made somewhere to keep the price point - we got so many other upgrades so not complaining too much about this one, just an observation.8) This computer can be your primary IMO - its got all the right features and is now just as powerful as the MB Pro.All in all - Apple did a great job and finally created a MBA that is for the masses and will satisfy the masses. This notebook is the PC killer.... at least it was for me.Update 8/2: Now that I've been using this for a week, the fan does get a little louder if doing high processing requirement tasks like streaming video. Otherwise, it runs completely silent for web surfing and other administrative tasks.::R. Chen "wahoodude23"::5.0::July 25, 2011
R2HUTBG72ODMZX::The new MBA comes full circle - ONE AMAZING LAPTOP!::This is my second MacBook Air.  I loved my first MBA, which was the 2008 Core 2 Duo model (MB003LL/A), running in 32 bit mode.  I used it 8 to 10 hours per day (as my primary computer).  However, it did get hot, and lacked the horsepower when put under load.Naturally, I was very excited to hear Apple was going to put the i7 processor in the MBA refresh!  I purchased my second MBA, the 2011 i7 model (MC966LL/A) a few months ago, and I must say there is no comparison between the two.The newer i7 (Sandy Bridge configuration) is a workhorse!  I am running OSX 10.7.3, 64 bit, and usually have around 3-4 applications open at any given time while I work.  My typical apps that are open include a combination of MS Office for Mac -  Outlook, Excel, and Word, and Adobe CS 5.5 - Lightroom, Photoshop, and Dreamweaver.My typical use of the i7 MBA include using it as a backup for RAW photos, for a quick look / editor of same RAW photos, and for web page design, and / or editing.Unlike some of the reviewers, I find that I really have to tax the i7 MBA to get it hot.  Which is unlike my first MBA, when leaving Outlook open, and using Excel kicked on the fan and increased the temp.  On the new i7 MBA for example,  I had to run an HD movie in the background, while opening RAW photos in Photoshop to get it hot...but under normal use, it seems more than competent at managing heat.Did I mention the new i7 MBA is fast?  I know it sounds nuts, but the new i7 Dual Core MBA with 4 GB of RAM seems to be as fast as my 27" i7 Quad Core iMac with 16 GB of RAM, when it comes to managing RAW photos in Lightroom, and editing RAW photos in Photoshop...I kid you not!Needless to say, I am more than pleased with the performance of the new MBA, and would recommend it to anyone!::J.

RE7CBSBZKCH15::13 inch vs 11 inch Air::I agonized for months over the 13 inch vs 11 inch macbook air.  I made 3 separate trips to the Apple store near me to try out both models (they don't work on commission there, and Amazon is less expensive than the Apple store, so I had every reason to buy it here).  Ultimately, I couldn't decide with confidence, but was tired of being frozen with indecision, so I ordered the 13"I am VERY glad I made the decision I did.Now, the 11" was perfectly fine in many ways.  I tried a typing speed test on both the 11" and 13" and had similar results.  While the 11" has a smaller body, the keyboard is just about the same size, if not exactly the same.Here's the big deal:  My typical use case is propped up in bed with my laptop on my knees.  I used to do this with my 15" macbook pro.  Now with the 13", it's fine, but it's definitely on the smaller side of comfortable with respect to screen size.  Yes, I can increase the screen image and zoom in, but then you can mess up the native navigation of many sites.  At least making it hard to navigate.  And it's more of a pain.  So the point is, with the 13" being JUST ok, I am certain that the 11" would not be ok.  In this lounging position, the laptop is about 2 feet away.  I think that's just too far for an 11".  And I'm happy with my 13"I feel like all the other reviews have touched on the gorgeous body and the lightweight size .... Macbook Air is fantastic.  So I wanted to focus specifically on my issue - which was the 11" vs the 13"One last thing - the reason I can't give this 5 stars is because the fan gets VERY loud and seems to come on very frequently.  I was previously using a Macbook Pro 15" and the fan didn't come on nearly as often.  It seems this fan is running loudly nearly all the time.  And it's actually distracting.  At the same time, it doesn't get as hot as my macbook pro did, which makes sense if the fan is kicking on sooner.I would definitely make this same decision again.::Rebecca N::4.0::March 24, 2012
R18OGN8GAZ9X42::Great for Computer Science majors::I was a bit skeptical about using a Mac for school since my funds are limited, but since the Air was very slim, light and had great battery life (not to mention, a great display, illuminated keyboard and terrific fit and finish) I spent my hard earned money plus Christmas money a new Mac Book Air.  Its great, I have dual booted it so I can use my Windows based compliers/development suites and I can use the Mac OS for everything else.  I love how Mac OS has no registry and Apps can be installed as a single instance instead of the messy Windows way of doing things.  MAC OS's UNIX under pinnings make it stable and reliable.  Since  my new Air is only computer I have at school, I use it 8-10 hours a day and have had no crashes yet.  I have Netflix streaming a movie, while I am chatting with friends and using X-Code writing my CS project all while writing this review and this Mac Book Air handles it without a glitch.For Engineering and Computer Science Majors:Given the Mac comes with Boot Camp you have a way of booting traditional Windows based applications on your Mac.  Matlab, AutoCAD etc...  I know some of these applications are available for Mac, but usually your university does not have the Mac versions at student prices (my university has an arrangement with Microsoft so we get all Microsoft software for $5, so I get Visual Studio for $5).  Best part is you can download X-Code for free from the APP store which is awesome for C++, C, C#, C Objective  code.  I have been using Visual Studio for couple years; X-Code is way better. Better tools, easier on the eyes and just a more robust development enviroment.  NOTE: You do need a full version of Windows to install with Boot Camp(with unused product key).Also get some form of accidental coverage for any Apple computer.  I work part time as a Geek Squad agent and see many  students bring in their Macs with cracked screens.  Its about $400-$500 to get your Mac display replaced.  Its expensive.  Apple parts are expensive.  It doesn't take much to crack these screens.  Get some accidental coverage.The Mac Book AIr is a fine piece of engineering/art.  (I'm not an Apple "fanboy", I just appreciate things that are well designed and made.)  This is good stuff.::Bears Fan "ADP"::5.0::January 28, 2012
RGYCQ0OTHI7TE::Looks great, light, and great for travel::I have the late 2010 15" MPB i7 at home and the late 2010 iMac 27" i7 at work so for xmas I bought this for my girlfriend for xmas.  I want to say that I bought this for my girlfriend, but really it is just an excuse for me to buy this laptop without her complaining.  Personally, I don't have an OS preference because I can use either and I don't have an excuse or reason why I use one or the other.  Sometimes I go months without using OSX and then months without using Windows so for me, buying this was purely aesthetic.Things I like:- OSX Lion- Great industrial design- Light in weight- Great battery life (average around 4-5 hrs with videos and 6-7 with out videos)- Backlid Keyboards- Ergonomic - friendlier edges- Multitouch- Screen resolution and brightness- Restart/RebootThings I don't like:- Front facing camera - crappy resolution as always.- Keyboards, it will take sometimes to get used to since the spacing is a bit smaller, to me anyhow.- Shut down - zzzzzz- Wake up time.  Its definitely slower compared to my MBP and surely a lot slower compare the Chrome book.  Waking it up is also tricky as sometimes it goes back to sleep instantly.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does it is annoying.- Temperature - it does get hot if you're watching flash or any videos online/offline.  Don't even think about gaming...- Loud - In relation to the temperature, the fan is kinda loud for a small laptop.- Graphic - crappy as always, this thing is pathetic so don't expect too much from it.  No matter how much they (intel or apple) try to sell this, it will always be a sub-par graphic engine.- Speakers - crappy as always.  The speakers are loud, but that's it.  They're just outputting loud noise with no depth. If you're remotely an audiophile, you will never use the speakers.Some of my "crappy as always" may be harsh, but if you use apple products long enough you know it is true.  Apple considers their line of products as premium products and charge premium price for them.  It's only fair that I review this laptop as a premium product and as a premium product you can't cut corners and except the consumers not to know.  So that's my review of the late 2011 MPA 13" i5.::Vietson V. Nguyen::4.0::January 27, 2012
R2LEB6GQAN1N6R::switching to apple/osx after 23 years of pc/windows::3 weeks have passed since I received my 13" Macbook Air, my first Mac.I am a passionate user of PC's since 1988, the first one had a 8086 processor, 640kB Ram and two 5" floppies, no HDD. The addition of the first 20 MB hdd in 1989 was a HUGE progress. Fast forward to 2011 and here I am with core i5, 4GB Ram, 128GB SSD on my Air.About the hardware in Macbook Air:extraordinary feel and finish, a pleasure to hold, touch and look. The unibody enclosure is very sturdy and gives a constant feeling of solidity and foreverlastingness. I love the fact that the bottom is securely held in place by screws. I never changed the battery in my previous laptops and never upgraded anything in them. The keyboard is pleasant to use, size and travel are perfect for me. The backlight is a feature I find absolutely necessary, as I use the computer a lot at home in dim lit environments. The system adjusts automatically the brightness of the screen and of the keyboard very close to my taste, sometimes I have to make adjustments which is very easy to do with the dedicated keys. The display at 1440x900 in 13" is practically retina class for me, as I cannot see the individual pixels anymore. It is a great display, with very good definition and color, a pleasure for all the tasks I am performing on the computer. The touchpad is fantastic to use, as your fingers glide with almost no friction on the surface, and the button has the right amount of pressure threshold. The display hinge has perfect movement and feel. The case gets not hot in my normal use, and having and absolute silent laptop (no HDD spin and no fan blowing) is and absolute joy for me. The battery lasts between 5 to 7 hours, maybe even more if I use it in the night, all lights at minimum. No optical drive? I do not need it anymore. Two usb ports, enough for an external HDD and a thumb drive. With the thunderbolt I connect to an external display when I am at the office. With the SD card slot I import the photos from my Nikon D5000. Magsafe connector for power? A little masterpiece on its own. Almost forgot the tiny 45W power adapter, very small and with long cords on both ends.My verdict, hardware: attention to detail taken to extremes gives perfect product and satisfaction.About the software Mac OSX Lion and bundles:Stable and fast operation. It shuts down in seconds, and boots in under 20. That is a HUGE improvement over my PC/winXP. Sleep is a big surprise for me. Practically, it is instant on and instant off, just open/close the display on your Air!  Multitouch gestures are fantastic. It took me a few days to get used to the 1, 2, 3, 4 finger gestures. They are all great and improve my productivity in ways hard to describe. Safari has all the functionality I need, and more. Finder was my greatest challenge to get used to, me being hardwired to total commander's two panes type of operation. Now i find it very good. For documents I am using Libre Office (have used Open Office since 2006 on PC). iPhoto has also all the features I need to fiddle with my new photos and the 30k digital photos collection that goes back to 1999. Mail is great, also is spotlight. I only disabled dashboard, which I do not understand right now, maybe later. Coming from PC, I immediately installed Sophos Antivirus, just to relax my mind. Fonts and the looks of windows, button, menus . . . are very well implemented, to the last detail. Everything on the display look pleasant to my eyes, even the pages I regularly visit are rendered in a more pleasant way for me. I do a lot of pdf reading, and the full screen capability of preview combined with the possibility of making annotations makes my Air now being favorite, better than the iPad. Photobooth is an amazing application, we had hours of laughter with the kids and our friends. I have a pair of Logitech usb 2.0 speakers that worked (to my surprise) immediately I connected them, I mostly listen to internet radio. I have still a lot to discover and learn.My verdict, software: Mac OSX Lion is an environment that puts the user and his satisfaction on the first place, with success.About Amazon:I am very pleased with Amazon, I can learn about the products, can learn about other users experiences, can make a well informed buying decision. The service was excellent with all my purchases.My recommendation : try before you buy, and give opinions only on things you own or use regularly.::pol::5.0::December 11, 2011
R23YE3IZBAG2HN::Don't Believe the 7hr battery life::You will not get 7hrs of battery life, even with nothing running and screen dimmed so much you can barely see it. It is more like 5hrs if you are not watching video and you have the brightness turned way down (and that is pushing it). I don't know why Apple say's this thing will get 7hrs. Other than that performance is great and the screen resolution to me is what sets this thing apart from other ultra books. The high screen resolution makes it seem like you are working on a 15.4" screen. I would give it 4 stars if Apple hadn't misled me about the battery life. If it can get 7 hrs, as they say, then they ought to tell ya exactly what was running and exactly what was installed at the time they got it. Because it is not easily replicable.::Matthew T Atkinson::3.0::November 13, 2011
R283SFBD964KHG::lcd::seeing many reports like mine of lcd failure from SLIGHTEST trauma . . . and cracked screens are not covered by warranty (even extended!) Fixing this (model 1369) costs ~ $600!  I too was thrilled at first but now at 11 months disappointed.  APPLE needs to stand by this defect and correct this problem for future of MBA's::Louis B. Fowler Jr.::1.0::April 13, 2012
R1R5J7O0011LBK::Makes Owning a Laptop Fun Again Yay::Switched over after 20 years of Windows. And I don't plan on going back. I absolutely love this machine. Fast, responsive, light, clean, simple, chic. Now if I can just get that elephant Microsoft Word for Mac 2011 to function I'll be in heaven. Strongly recommend that you splurge for the 256 SSD. The faster processor isn't necessary, from what I can tell, but the 256 SSD is definitely needed in order to relax and spread out. The MAC OS seems to take big bites out of your storage space with its own backups and mysterious other machinations, so plump for the big drive. Also, after reading so many gripes about the heat and battery life, I have to report that this laptop is much much cooler than my 3-year-old Dell Latitude, and the battery lasts longer than any I've ever had. The shortest run Ive gotten from it has been 4 hours, and the longest about 8. Granted, I've always had 12-inch Dell notebooks, which are not necessarily stamina kings,  but still. As for the heating, I guess I have noticed it when streaming videos or movies, so if that's something you'll be doing a lot, and for more than half an hour at a time, you might want to research the issue further. But for general browsing and applications, there's no heat problem at all, even when using it on my lap.One annoying and seemingly unnecessary thing versus Windows is the way the MAC OS wants to control all your files instead of letting you organize and maintain them yourself. iPhoto, for example, duplicates every photo on your hard drive, thereby doubling the space occupied, and won't let you import photos into files of your own name and choosing. The MAC mail program makes 4 or 5 copies of every attachment, squirreling them away all over the place, and the word software (Pages or Word) replicates files so many times over I can't keep track of them all. But I'm learning workarounds to all of this--e.g., use Gmail and Picassa (and/or Xee) instead of Mac Mail and iPhoto, change the settings in Word to make no backups at all, and then just manually backup after every few revisions, etc. And really, as long as the hard drive isn't full, none of this really matters. It just bugs me from an efficiency standpoint. The important thing, when switching over from a PC, is to realize that almost everything that it seems, at first, like you can't do on a Mac, you actually can. You just have to do a little digging on Google or MacRumors to figure out how. Give it a few weeks to get used to the OS and to get everything configured. This machine is worth the effort.::Mallo Bennie "Mallo"::5.0::August 24, 2011
R6CKE6IIMLMTY::Buy it now::I know this is going to be updated in a few months, but, if you need a laptop, BUY THIS NOW!!!!I rarely write reviews, but after using this for a week I feel I have to. I've been using computers since 1982 (VIC 20) and building my own since 1990, so I think I'm qualified to write this. I thought long and hard before buying this computer. I'm disabled now and moving around the house is hard, so I needed a laptop that would allow me to work at my computer easily.  I've always used Microsoft, but I've become increasingly upset with cost of upgrades, ease of use, etc. & don't like the feel of Windows 8 so decided to look at a Mac for the first time. The keyboard on the Air is the best on a laptop I've ever used & better than many regular keyboards I've had, there was a learning curve with the operating system, about 4 hours, but I MUCH prefer it to Windows. Easy to find a program with Launchpad, no windows covering the screen, easy to swipe between open programs & the Trackpad, once you're used to it, actually works better than a mouse in most circumstances. The App store provides fast, easy access to literally hundreds of low priced apps that work smoothly, making it easy to find a program to do tasks that OS doesn't work for.In conclusion, If you want a computer for regular use, email, light photo editing, light gaming, web access I don't think you'll find a better buy. Plus the great screen - I've heard they will have a higher def screen with the new Mac Book AIr, but this is better than most screens I've ever seen and I couldn't ask for more. I never imagined that such a light, beautifully designed, ergonomic machine could be priced so low. Sure it's more expensive than a Windows laptop, but from the moment you unpack this you know it's a quality machine.Yes they're bringing out a new model, but the specs on the machine mean that, unless you're a heavy gamer, this will be able to meet your computing needs for many years to come. BUY IT NOW and enjoy it yourself.::M. Freeman "cyderman"::5.0::April 20, 2012
R1PU86LWF52482::Boy have macs come a long long way!::I have had the macbook air for about 2 months now and I do like it very much.++ Great little computer... all most of us need really.  Gee-wiz chassis.--  It does have a problem with wifi.  For me, it' sonly the upper 5 g band.I am a somewhat technical user of computers with a degree in computer science.  I currently support BI reporting solutions for a hospital patient accounting software provider.  We use windows laptops mostly for our workstations... though, MacBooks are available and if your job role doesn't require RDP and certain other things.This is the first Apple computer that I have owned and the first version of Mac OS that I have used since before the wild cat names.  It still has the mac style, but certain inflexible ideas of the past have been reworked so that the transition from the PC to the mac is not as jarring.  Windows 7 has improved much also.  I would say the feel of the two desktop environments is a toss up.  Mac is simpler, but more two dimensional.  Windows gives the home/workstation user just too much at times, but it certainly feels a bit richer when you are using it.  Mac OS is just a better home PC OS these days.  Good for you Apple, sometimes a big corporation can do something worth while with software.1) The air is thin and light; perhaps slightly lighter than it needs to be (more battery time please).2)  Battery is great, but not as good as advertised (bit of a trend with Apple?).  Too get the advertised time, just be careful what you keep open and be sure to lock down features for the flash plugin.  There are some very thoughtfully written articles on line to help you get your battery life up closer to 7 hours.3)  Edges are slightly sharp, could be helped if they would make the front edge a little thicker.  I suppose they are trying to set a standard.4)  The web browser crashes more often than I'd expect given the noise that Apple fan-boys make.  Common sense tells us that things like this will happen.5)  Gee wiz it's Unix and many familiar Unix utilities are loaded and as light weight as ever.  Nerds can have fun with this too.6)  Mac Air resolution is great, though it's definitely not a retina display, it's dense and may appear so from a distance.7)  Mac Air text can be very small due to the small screen (and great res.).  I have perfect vision so I can read it... but I might tweak the settings somewhere.8)  Xcode.  I bought this partly to try Xcode.  I was worried, but it actually works quite well.  It's very snappy.  The little iPhone simulator pops right up with no problem.  So far, I am very pleased.9)  Bought an adapter for my Dell 1080 IPS display... works like a charm.  I'm using the DVI adapter... just wanted to make use of the DVI plug on the screen.  It certainly seems to work just nicely.10)  Can't get the upper wifi band to work well.  Seems to be fine with lower one.  It works for a bit, then it gets stopped up.  I will call Apple about this soon.  It's working just fine with my Dell... maybe the air weaker antenna?11)  Silly card reader slot.  Cards to not slip most of the way in, like on the dell and many others, with that delightful little "snick snick" feel.  Instead it sticks out a good half centimeter and nothing provides no satisfying click.  It reads the cards just fine, but you will have to remember to put them away when transporting your Air or something will be broken for sure.Hope this helps.  Have a nice day folks!::UserInVT::4.0::February 26, 2012
R1J1WVOGRTROAA::I love this thing for school::I just got my macbook air from best buy and it has been great for school and note taking. Word for mac has a notebook view that makes taking and organizing notes really easy. The battery on this thing lasts a long time if all you are doing is in class using word for taking notes. If you are worried about being able to get through a day of school with light internet use and heavy note taking it should last you all day easily. After using mine for 6 hours straight of mainly note taking with maybe a half hour or an hour of internet web browsing thrown in my macbook was still at 22% Over all I am really happy with my purchase =)::Dexter "Dexypoo"::5.0::February 15, 2012
R35LFLR8X95L6M::WOW! This is an amazing laptop::This is my first Mac product. I have owned Windows laptops since 1997. From Dells to Vaios. From general corporate level stuff from Dell to top of the line Vaios - X, Z and FW. I was a little hesitant on buying this Mac, but I am glad I did!1. The instant on and off is a great feature and truly makes this a portable device.2. It is FAST and it runs cool. This was a first for me. I can't remember a singe time I have heard the fan (if there is one!)3. Mac OS X is just amazing. As a long time Windows user I can say that I like everything about OSX better. I guess you have to use it to realize just how refined the OS is. I love Time Machine and many of the included apps. Even the external display feature is very well implemented.4. Other little things like the fantastic keyboard, the mouse and build quality.I have the i7, 256GB model.  I'll update my review as I keep using it. I am now officially a convert :)::Jaffrey W.

R2P78G7AGMTMWL::Not What I was expecting::I when I purchased my laptop I was under the thinking that by old version it was the last one released or maybe the one before that. I ended up with a great little 2009 macbook air and a terribly mangled charging cord (wire is exposed at a spot or two). If I had known that at the time I would have not purchased it. Like I said I was expecting a newer version. I also feel like for the  condition and age I should not have been as much as I paid. I had contemplated  sending it back for a refund, but due to the fact that I am a student and it is mid semester that is next to impossible. Over all if I don't think about the fact that its not what I thought it was, paid to much for it, I had to purchase a new charger, and can't purchase accessories for it due to age it is a great laptop.::Brittany Bratton::3.0::February 18, 2014
R15TR6231SQ08R::Overall an amazing laptop::Despite knowing that Apple may release the updated version of Macbook Pro, I chose to buy Macbook Air 2011, and I have to say all my reservations about the Air are gone.This is an incredibly well-designed, super light and very efficient laptop that should fit most people's needs in my opinion.What I love:- Design: I have used Windows based PC all my life and after using Macbook Air, I have to say the quality of design of this Apple product is superb. It has really clean, minimalist design that looks aesthetically pleasing. I also love the aluminum unibody. And the backlit keyboard is not only useful but also visually pleasing.- Screen: While not the retina display found in iPhone and iPad (the new one), I'm overall happy and impressed with the Air's clear and crisp screen quality.- Weight: Ultra-thin and really light. What more can I say? :)- Snappy: this is the fastest and the most responsive laptop I've ever used. It boots in like 5 seconds (unlike my previous samsung laptop that took literally at least 3 minutes to finish booting). It opens applications almost instantaneously. The internet experience is just as snappy. No more waiting!- Battery life: I'm sure the battery life depends on individual's usages, but based on my experience, the Air lasts me at least 6 hours, sometimes 7. I mostly use the Air for writing and modifying documents using Word, using Safari for web browsing, watching videos and listening to music via iTunes. However, the battery life seems to deteriorate when using Skype.- General usability: This is my first Apple laptop, so at first I didn't know what to expect. I did need to adapt somewhat because mac OS is different from Windows. But after a week of use, the general experience of using the Air has been outstanding. There's hardly any freezes. Everything just goes smoothly and seamlessly.What could be improved:- Heat: the heat and fan noise hasn't been a problem for me, but I did witness that when I'm using certain applications like Skype or Handbrake, the Air did get noticeably warm and the fans kicked in.  However, in most circumstances, not much complaint here, but I still thought  I would mention this.Conclusion: this is a really well-built laptop. I got 256GB i5 Air, and this is the best laptop I've ever used so far. As long as you're not a heavy user who needs to run power-consuming programs, this laptop should be perfect for every-day user. Also being a college student myself, I definitely recommend Air to other students because it is light, really portable without breaking your back with already heavy backpack, great battery life, and outstanding overall usability. Unless you really want the new Pro, I think Air is a great investment.::kjra2250::5.0::June 6, 2012
RN1CIG3NDWX6L::Absolute best laptop I've ever owned!::I've had a regular MacBook from 2007 that is still going strong but I wanted something lighter so I finally pulled the trigger to buy this MacBook Air. At first I was worried that the screen might be too small but it doesn't feel that way at all to me. So glad I bought this beautiful piece of machinery. Apple never fails to impress!::Sohrob Tahmasebi::5.0::March 1, 2012
R2TOZXCACFQUVT::Best laptop I've ever used.::I've owned four laptops in my lifetime. The first two were hp and the last two have been macbook airs. My first laptop was quite a few years back and it was mainly used for school. The second laptop I got was an HP Envy 13, after my first laptop I just wanted something that I didn't need to have plugged in after 2-3 hours of use, or in other words ONE class. The envy did not fulfill this at all (there's a reason they called it a macbook clone). So after the first revision of the macbook I decided okay lets try this out. WOW! not only did it last me more than one class without charging, I was able to get through THREE 2 hour classes without charging AND still have about 50% battery life. Keep in mind I would tweek my settings to get those results (low brightness, minimal browser use, MS word or excel open the whole time). My only complaint was that the first revision was a bit sluggish and it could be felt when I would have multiple browser windows open. The second revision (2011) took care of this one complaint I had, while still not as speedy as a top of the line desktop, you have to keep in mind that you need to make some concession for portability. Its thin, its fast, the flash hard drive is zippy. I do have some accessories as well, the superdrive that I use sparingly and don't even take with me 90% of the time (disks, who uses disk now?), and the usb to ethernet adapter just in case you venture into some third world location that does not have wifi (just kidding).::vasq::5.0::February 2, 2012
R12VUXARHERF4S::Excellent Mac Notebook But Lot of Keyboard and Trackpad Problems in Bootcamp Windows::It is a beautiful Mac notebook computer. The only problems I have had with the Mac OS part is that lot of the legacy Mac programs, including Microsoft Office 2004 & 2008 do not work in the new OS Lion.But if you use Windows programs in Bootcamp then there are a lot of problems.This has Bootcamp 4 and their trackpad and keyboard drivers do not work well. The keys constantly keep moving positions and the trackpad can be clicked only in the right front corner. Scrolling also does not work well. The trackpad and keyboard work very well in Bootcamp 3 on my MacBook Pro. But Apple has still not fixed these issues in Bootcamp 4.::SanjeevP "Bottom Line"::4.0::December 22, 2011
R3CKIEYLGXS76Z::Awesome laptop, graphics inferior to 2010 version::We own both the 2010 version of this laptop and the 2011 version (this model). The 2010 version has a Core 2 duo processor with an NVIDIA graphics card embedded. The 2011 version has an i5 processor (Sandy Bridge) but Intel integrated graphics (to be clear, the model being reviewed here). Both laptops have 4GB of memory and 256GB hard drives. The 2010 version, which I personally carry, is the best laptop I have ever owned. The solid state drive makes it more than fast enough for everything I do. Even running Windows 7 in vmware is fast enough to not be bothered by the virtualization. I love that laptop.This 2011 version we bought for my wife. This laptop is even faster but the graphics is inferior. I play Starcraft with my son and the 2011 Macbook air is a step backwards from the 2010 version in terms of performance in that game. Sure it works, but it's not as fun. it's glitchy. In fact, it seems more glitchy than a 3 yr old Macbook with older integrated graphics.This is not really a revelation as many blogs have pointed out that the 3D graphics in the 2011 version are a step backwards from the 2010 version. But unfortunately, while the 2010 version had adequate graphics and CPU performance, the 2011 version has inadequate graphics performance and more than adequate CPU performance. I would not be happy with this laptop. My wife on the other hand, loves it. She does not game so if Excel opens a microsecond faster or a web page renders more quickly, it's a pure win for her.In my opinion, if you care about 3D graphics performance, you might be better off with a used 2010 Macbook air.  When Apple comes out with a 13 inch Air based on the Intel Ivy Bridge chipset, buy that and resell your 2010 Macbook. Ivy Bridge is rumored to have better graphics.::Andrew Erlichson "phanfare"::4.0::December 13, 2011
RR3NDGPMC747O::I love it, and I hate it::I've had my MBA for a few months. I had a MBP (running Snow Leopard) prior to this which was stolen. I love the size and lightness of the MBA. I love the modern, chiseled look, the trackpad, the performance, and all the apps (which work great most of the time). The App Store is fabulous. Its a great place to find an app for almost anything. I say almost because it doesn't have everything. There's a lot more SW available out there on the web though.What I don't like about the MBA are the frequent lockups requiring a force reboot, or the many times I've had to force quit an application, or restart it because it crashed. Its frustrating. I've had more issues with this laptop than I've ever had with a PC. I'm not a fan of Microsoft either, but lately I've just been doubting all the hype out there about Mac reliability and stability. As far as I'm concerned, its BS. Don't get me wrong, I still love this little machine, but I wish it was more stable. It also gets a bit hot when creating and sometimes viewing video and the fan will kick up to full speed.My MBP seemed to be much more stable and run a lot cooler. Lion has too many issues. I don't see updates coming as often as I would like. What are they sitting around doing at Apple? I don't care about a stupid iTunes update (which I seem to get all the time), I need updates that are going to make my system more stable. I need them to fix Lion!I'll keep putting up with the issues I guess. I'll take my MBA to the apple store as often as I can to get help... which is a really nice option to have!There a whole lot of things to like about this machine. Like I said, I love it... but at the same time I sometimes hate it.Update 2/10/12: got a Lion SW update recently (ver 10.7.3), and its been more stable so far.Update 6/1/12: Been quite stable last several months. I love this thing. I don't hate it anymore.::Doodle Meriwether::4.0::January 31, 2012
R2NM6QSNR7NNN5::Nice but not worth the $$$::Thanks to my profession I have been able to use a Mac AIR over a year and have been recently upgraded to latest version of one.Overall its a great lap top but its also $1000.  You could get a more powerful Wintel laptop for half the money.  I realize that is sacrilege to MAC OS guru's.  But the fact is as easy and solid as apple tries to make OS X and MAC hardware they both still have some issues.- Both versions of the mac air I use and a MAC pro I also use constantly drop WIFI.  While non-mac laptops attached to the same WAP do not drop.  The frustrating thing is the apple goes out of their way to hide all of the real advanced settings that may actually fix the issue.  I understand they want to make these things like a toaster and thats fine, but some time you need to open the "hood" and fiddle with the "engine".  OS X is based on a UNIX variant and I have been working on various UNIX flavors for 16 years, I am no stranger to UNIX OS's.  But even at the CLI level they hide many of the advanced tools that one could use if one should run into an issue.  Of course you can pack the thing up and take it to the genius bar, which may cost you money.BTW in windows or linux you are able to get to the advanced settings easily enough if needed.-  As much as I don't love windows because of its instability, make no mistake OS X is not immune.  While it is overall more stable than windows 7 it does have its moments of instability.  Run it too hard or open too many windows it can freeze or hang.  Matter of fact I notice when I run the airs and the pro hard I see bluetooth devices loose connectivity, especially the mouse, and the only way to get it back is to reboot.  Wait I thought windows only did that, well OS X does too unfortunately, albeit not as much.- OSX still is safer than windows as far as viruses go, but that is because there are more virus written for windows.  IT is not because OS X is immune.  Purchasing virus software is a good idea.-  Software is still kind of limited for the Mac, and the ones that are available are usually pricy.  Sometimes I just want to play a game, but most of the good ones run on windows.  If you are not  a gamer or power user and just want something to surf the net why pay the big bucks when you can get a Acer for under $400.I can ramble all day with the comparisons but end of the day the Mac air is a cool device and sleek but I wouldn't dole out my money for it.::Amazon Customer::3.0::January 29, 2012
R3QAU5ZHIGEKRU::Excellent replacement for MBP 13.3"::Other reviewers have covered most of it, so I will throw out random facts.* The screen is NOT semi-glossy. It is a bare LCD with a very nice layer of anti-reflective coating which minimizes glare.* The 13.3" is a better choice, because the longer run time allows you to leave the charger home/in the office, which more than make up for the heavier weight.* The 'latch' finish is smoother than the MBP, so it does not scratch or even cut your skin like the MBP.* The Thunderbolt port is not as robust as the ones found on the MacBook Pro, iMac, or even the Mac mini (single-channel vs dual-channel).* Unlike the currently-shipping iMac (5/2011) and MacBook Pro (2/17/2011), which can accommodate 10.6.8 (because at the time of shipment, they had 10.6.6 on them and nothing changed), the 7/20/2011 release of MacBook Air and Mac mini REQUIRE 10.7.n. 10.7 is a bloody mess and for that, I am taking off a star.* Next version (probably Feb-April) shall have 8GB of RAM. Those who find 4GB limiting should buy a MacBook Pro instead. I find the MacBook Pro to be surprisingly smooth with only 4GB. However, I can easily gobble up 8GB, as software gets more and more deficient.On 10.7:'Natural scrolling' is anything but natural. When your finger is not on the item being moved, convention (the same way we have been used to for almost 30 years) should prevail.Launch Pad? You'd better pray that all of your applications fit the first screen.Mission Control? Austin (Location of Apple's offices in TX), we do have a serious problem. Give me back Exposé.::Paul C.

R3OC969Z2DGDHD::This Laptop is a Better Choice for Many Road Warriors than the Macbook Pro::Well folks, I received my 13" MBA yesterday, and I wanted to provide my impressions. Mine has the 256GB SSD, a $300 upgrade over the base model.  Some are comparing this laptop to the 11" MBA.  However, for many, the 13" MBA is now powerful enough to be considered a replacement for bigger Macbook Pro Computers. Rather, it's about how well I think this computer will address my needs.  If your needs (computing and travel) are similar to mine, you might find my impressions useful. I won't discuss performance.  I don't run benchmarks, and the benchmarks I've seen so far show that this computer is much, much faster than my nearly 4-year-old MBP, which is my most important performance requirement.Based on my initial impressions, I say that the reasons to purchase a MBP instead of a MBA have been reduced drastically.  These reasons include*Needing the most powerful laptop available (a desktop replacement)*Running programs that need/can use more than 4GB of RAM*Needing greater storage (SSD chips get real expensive real fast)*Wanting or needing a 15 or 17" screen.*Needing a greater variety and number of IO portsFirst, a little about me so that you can determine whether my computing needs are similar enough to yours.  My needs and desires for a laptop include being able to take it on the road with me and duplicate much of what I do in my office on trips lasting from one day to two-weeks. I, therefore, eliminated the 11" MBA because its screen is simply too small for use as a primary computer for more than a day or two.  I need to be able to remote connect to my office computer and sync daily using Dropbox and Sugarsync.  My most used programs are Safari, email (I use Thunderbird but will consider transitioning to Apple Mail in Lion), MS Office (Word, Excel and Powerpoint), and for my photography addiction, Lightroom and Photoshop. So, I do not engage in heavy lifting in my computer use.  The 256GB seems like an excellent storage compromise.  My old laptop had 250GB of storage and that proved adequate, and I have no doubt that this will still be the case.  I found that for the type of computing I do, having a fast SSD enhances the usage experience far more than a faster processor.  I had a fast SSD installed into my 2010 iMac.  The iMac was far faster than the Mac Pro that I use at work which doesn't have an SSD.  Of course, this assertion would not be true if I edited video or ran elaborate statistical analysis etc.As for size, the MBA's surface area is pretty big, but it's much smaller than the 15" that it replaces. The thickness--or rather, thinness--of this machine is amazing. For me, next to a current generation MBP the rear at .68" is noticeably and significantly smaller than the .95" of the MBP. More importantly, the width rapidly decreases in size down to .11".  This laptop will go anywhere.  I will have no problem stuffing it into any bag I have or sliding it into the magazine pouch in the back of the airplane seat in front of me.  As suspected, the wedge shape facilitates putting this laptop  in many tight places.  What I didn't realize, was that it is just so super thin throughout, that stuffing this laptop into tight places will rarely be a problem. I live in a medium-size town with a small airport served by small jets. In the past, if I wanted to put my overstuffed bag in the small overhead bin, I invariably had to remove my MBP. I have no doubt that that will be much less of a problem with this laptop. In, fact I will get more space by removing a book, magazine or report from my bag. It will also be less of a hassle removing and reinserting the MBA in my bag when going through airport security.  Thus, I suspect that I will value the size relative to larger laptops more so than the weight difference.On the weight, this bad boy is heavier than expected.  I guess I've gotten used to carrying around an iPad. I'm no body builder, but I'm in pretty good shape.  I still bench press 140lbs and backpack with a 30lb load. Nonetheless, 3lbs is above the "I don't think about it, just take it with me all the time" weight. I haven't picked up the 11", so it is hard to imagine that the 1/2 lb would make much difference. But as someone else who had both the 11 and 13 said, they found that they took the 11" with them more often than they took the 13", so even small differences in weight matter. Suffice it to say, I'm glad it's not any heavier. Clearly, the 1.5 lb difference between this MBA and the smallest Macbook Pro is not something that I want to consider. The MBP's added weight just creates an additional reason to think about whether to take it with you, which in my mind defeats the purpose of portable computing.The screen is excellent. It's very clear. One feature that I hadn't realized previously is that its native resolution is 1440x900, the same as the 15" MBP.  By contrast the 13" MBP is 1280x800 and the 11" MBA is 1366x768.  This statistic provides a pleasant surprise.  It makes using this laptop less of a compromise than I had originally thought. The negative is that text characters are smaller than I'm use to.  I'll have to see whether I get use to it.Finally, and perhaps the biggest negative is Apple's failure to add cellular capabilities to this machine. Having the ability to access the Internet anytime and anywhere would provide tremendous value for me.  The Sony Vaio has it (albeit at a much higher price), so the technology exists.  This absence was almost a deal killer for me, which is why I gave the MBA a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating.  What got me over the hump was that I really wanted a smaller computer than my 15" MBP and the knowledge that Apple laptops really hold their value.  If Apple comes out with a MBA with cellular capabilities in the next year, I will be able to sell this laptop for 70-80% of what I paid for it. So my investment will be cheaper than leasing it for the same period.Overall, a very impressive machine.  The size is a huge plus.  The weight is acceptable, but I'd love it if it were closer to 2lbs.  The screen is excellent.  It strikes a good balance between being compact yet big enough to get work done.  I am quite please with this laptop, and I suspect that it will bite into the market shares of both 13 and 15" MBP laptops.::Gatorowl::4.0::July 26, 2011

R2NYUXMOA3EED2::LOVE LOVE LOVE::I don't know what I ever did without this. I was a PC person before, and even if this is the old version, I see no reason to upgrade for quite some time. It's so light, it's so fast, and I never used the disk drive on my old computer anyway so I don't miss it at all. I got it used on here for MUCH less than original cost and I want to just hug it everyday.Tablets work seamlessly with a mac, even off-brand non-wacoms (I have a monoprice and a huiron, both highly recommended as well).I'd recommend getting an external hard drive and/or passport and keeping the majority of your files on there, and getting a case for this laptop that will have a compartment for the drive to go as well. I keep very little on the computer itself and it prevents the notorious issue of it overheating or running itself ragged. A nearly empty SSD is so fast, and the externals are easy to load up.If you don't want to bring your hard drive around, you can also take advantage of any number of cloud storage systems out there.::Sugarbee::5.0::February 11, 2014
R16XR752AS9NDG::A former PC user who has drank the cool aid::I absolutely loved owning this laptop. I had been a windows user and decided to go ahead and give apple a try. I don't ever plan on going back to windows. In fact, I liked it so much that I have just upgraded to the new model. This MacBook air model is beautiful, light, and performs very well.

R1G6TI3C9ZYS36::Another Great Apple Product!!!::I actually bought this computer as a gift and know that I made the correct decision. The computer is fast, light, great battery life and is an overall beautiful machine. I cannot say enough on how Apple has changed mine and my families life but they have for the better. They are always made really well and built to last and you may pay a bit more but is definitely worth it, we were Windows users for a very long time and always seemed to be missing something we found it in Apple.

R19CH4L0N7OIV9::First Mac since the Apple IIE - and it's a BIT improved.::Ok, so I know the Apple IIE wasn't a Mac, but it was the last Apple computer I used.  Close enough.  Anyway, I went through 3 Lenovo laptops in successive years; always having random hardware issues with all of them.  Love me some Windows 7, but the hardware was terrible (in my experience).  I stuck with Lenovo only because these were the company laptops and I didn't have any other options...until now.When my job evolved to where I spent most of my time working on the web, I then had a choice of laptops.  I've been a huge fan of the iPhones & my iPad 1, so I thought I'd go for a MacBook Air.So I've had a week of working on this new device, and so far I love it!  Sure, it's not perfect, but I've never enjoyed a laptop more.  The name "Air" certainly matches the design; it is incredibly light, which makes a HUGE difference in workability.  I feel like I can bring this laptop anywhere.  In the past, I never enjoyed lugging around a similarly sized, but 5.5lb Lenovo.  The weight makes all the difference.The Mac OS itself is fine;  it takes some getting used to, but I've picked up on the basic features quick enough.  Eventually I'll learn those mouse gestures!So far the only hiccups I've encountered have been the so-so battery life...and that's probably because I'm comparing this to another popular Apple product, the iPad.  The other issue is that so far I've been unable to print via Google Chrome, but that could very well be an issue on Google's end.  Safari works just fine.In the end, the point of a laptop, is mobility, isn't it?  And for that this MacBook Air gets 5-stars easily.  The screen-size is just right, and the weight is out-a-sight!  Oh man, that was lame. ;-)::Mac Riddel::5.0::December 28, 2011
R1FBHEV4VFZFQN::Love love love it::First Mac computer - absolutely love it.  Super light, brilliant screen, it turns on and off in a flash, battery life is great, etc.  There's a slight learning curve for new mac users, but it's fairly intuitive and after a while you'll never know how you dealt with the annoyances of a PC!::obenation::5.0::December 21, 2011

R14RDWSP5SIFS5::Surprised it doesn't get 5 star!!!::I love it, simply put. Being a 4 month Mac user, this is my first using a Mac and Mac OS, changing from Windows 7. I admit that I am a little bit geek and spent quite some to get exposed to OS Lion. I bet once you got the idea of structural design of the operating system you will never want to go back to windows (I am not saying I hate windows). And what is more is that the word processing tools (iWork suite) for Mac is no inferior to MS office. I spent much less time in learning how to use iWork than Office and even get confused, when historical reasons is temporarily out of my mind, why today's PC market share is so in favor of Microsoft.If you have long been considering switching to a MacBook but deterred by the fact that you might not be used to it's OS, it's now your time to make up your mind at least to get this MacBook Air a try in an Apple Store.::Qin::5.0::December 7, 2011

R1YAZ0ZSSKTFG2::Best ever, but...::Everything about this computer is fantastic, except for the Thunderbolt port.Thunderbolt is utterly useless, unless you plan on buying a $1,000 drive array, or a $1,000 monitor.  There is no firewire port, and most of us have firewire peripherals - external drives, video cameras, music recording interfaces.  And it's nearly 2012, and NOBODY makes a Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter yet.The Thunderbolt port is nice for someday in the future, but without a FireWire port, Thunderbolt is just a waste of space on this machine.This is my 6th Mac.  It's fantastic - light, fast, powerful, and it's still worth four stars.  But Apple really screwed up by dropping FireWire in favor of a connection that is useless now, and will be for the foreseeable future.::Foodie::4.0::November 23, 2011

RCU7NIQHX5XQE::Nice, but networking and printer issues::Great little laptop, really like the multi touch. Garage Band is cool and fun to play with. But:Does not handle WEP encryption well. So while you might run WPA at home, if you are at a hotspot running WEP, good luck. Even running WPA on my 802.11G router I notice irregular performance: ping will return 3,1,6,3,129,5,34,45,2,3MS with an occasional request timed out. My work Dell running XP will yield consistent replies <1MS. Something's not right there.Also, I have an older Canon MF1450 printer / scanner / fax and there are no drivers that work for it, at least not yet. It will see the printer, print to it, then it says "printer paused". So as of now I can't print from this thing. Very annoying.I am hoping these issues can be resolved with an OSX update. As of now, I am underwhelmed by the "Apple Experience". I've done more head scratching with this than with any other windows or linux box I've built. Maybe if you buy a new Apple AirPort router and Apple approved printer with your new Mac, and use it while eating applesauce with Apple compliant utensils, everything will "just work". However, I would expect better backward compatibility from a $1,300 laptop.I'm thinking maybe I should have waited for the Acer 128GB flash ultrabook? W7 is a pretty nice OS, too. If any Apple fans out there can set me straight, go for it. Any help I can get to bring the utility of this thing up to the price I paid will be much appreciated.::Rob Guffanti::3.0::January 14, 2012
R2CX6Z1NHDF6JD::Wow such a difference.::I just got it and even though I haven't used any Mac's before I love almost everything about it. Sleek design. Lightweight. Backlit keyboard. Fast i5 with 4GB of ram. Blazing fast SSD and minimal loading times for everything. Super high dpi, contrast, backlight screen.I'm a Computer Science major and I do have to spend a lot of time outside of my home coding group projects, and I absolutely adore my new macbook air and how much lighter and faster it is than my previous P8400 4GB Ram, 1GB M9600 Nvidia video Asus X83VM-X1 HDD laptop. It is so much more that any other windows laptop that I had chance to use having less than half the battery endurance. Simply said it is different in many ways. Different being mostly good (aside from the different right click on the touchpad that takes time to get used to).Strongly recommend this item to the many computer science majors out there. And one more thing, if you lack Windows, just put on a virtual machine using a virtualBox, vmware (the free version), or some other virtualization software available out there and use it when you need it. To my experience it is faster even when you dedicate 2.5GB of ram to it and use the SSD speedup to compensate most of the HDD thrashing.And yes I know $1240 (for 128GB i5) is more than if you buy 2 Windows based laptops, but if you can afford yourself to spend it and not regret it like if you would when buying a Windows based one when every time you use your not so well designed, awkward controlled(Mac is so much more natural in it's UI), slow (using HDD most of the time on a slower operating system), heavy, and not personalized windows based laptop.::Georgiy Chigrichenko::5.0::November 11, 2011
R7X3H8EPR8IK3::best notebook until now::I was hesitating before buying the MBA 13 version a few weeks and until now i think it was a good decision to buy this.  I have used iphone4 , a  macbook pro 17 as my basic computer and an iPad, and still couldn't solve the problem of traveling well. On the IPAD it is  simply impossible to work , it doesn't have a file management system, no ports etc. And i have good eyes so i can do the same things on my phone so i found it is not necessary to carry. My macbook pro is more than 3 kg.I chose the MBA 13 and not the 11 because the more SSD disk  though you can configure a 11 model with 256 as well  and the bigger screen, sd card slot. 30 grams difference in weight is nothing and for a longer use it is a big difference the bigger screen size. So if the money difference doesn't found for you i would definitely go with the 13 modell, that is is sure you won't regret that . If you get the 11 model what i did with my previous sony vaio for the whole time i had the feeling i should have chosen the bigger model.PROS :Fantastic feeling in your hand , a real piece of art .Very fast , much faster than my macbook pro 17 form mid 2009.Very good keyboard , very easy and fast to type on it .Excelent battery life.Good for ultraportable and for a basic use as well , multipurpose.SD card slot is very useful to download photos, videos or simply for storage .2 usb ports can be useful instead of the one one the 11 modelexcellent voice quality and power  when listening to musicCOINS:the built in mike  could be in a better place to record you louderthe resolution of the screen could be better, it is slightly less than the 11 inch model. Developers still couldn't solve it on any 13  screen model though this size is the good one if you want to carry and use for basic a modell.Summing it up if you have the budget and want to buy a notebook now , this is the choice. An ihpne and this and you are solved , you don't need anything else . For more storage buy a timemaschine or an external disk, and use your old monitor or tv if for some reason you need a bigger screen for a task. Extremely fast machine.

R2QNRPNXIHKALO::MBA 13 inch i5 128gb is made for starcraft 2 on the go!::I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about switching over to mac after so many years of windows but decided to make that leap finally due to frustrations on the windows platform, and let me say, I am in love. :)I won't go into details about the architecture of the mba 13 cuz of the numerous reviews.I did a lot of research trying to figure out if this laptop can run starcraft 2 comfortably (only game I really play AND need to play it on the go!) and let me say this baby can run starcraft 2 comfortably!I have the settings at just a little below medium (with a few options taken off) and it still looks beautiful and it is able to run at 4v4 full screen online with almost no lag, in fact I don't even notice it while playing it! the loadtimes are low and I always end up waiting on other ppl to load the game up.The only problem is the heating. The top left corner of the laptop heats up and the fan goes crazy. Baseline temps run at 45C and after running starcraft2 or skype with video or youtube, temps will run up to 92C! the fan will go from baseline 2000rpms to 6500rpms.Of note, I am still trying to get used to the osx system. The iphoto, itunes and the way they take control of everything and I "lose" sense of where they are at, but you can change your options to create the libraries accordingly without changing the original folders of the files.If you have any questions wrt starcraft2 I will try to answer. afterall..

R2WL38G0SK2J63::Converted Skeptic - Not - Please read update::Please read this entire review.  I have updated it as of March 2013.  I have left my original review in place so the reader can see how my views have changed from the original review date.***I bought a basic MacBook Air over one year ago.  I had never owned a Mac and the purchase price was high, so I was skeptical about what I was getting.  I also disliked the keyboard (still do) but went ahead because of the constant problems I was having with PCs.  I had spent a hundred dollars ridding the PC of virus problems - again - just prior to buying this MacBook Air, and that was while I was running anti-virus and anti-almost everything else (McAfee) software.  And that software was costing me money every year.  EVERY PC I have ever owned has slowed down over time, usually within six months,  and that includes desktops as well as laptops.  I was fed up with the PC problems and hidden cost so I bought this MacBook Air - and held my breath.I have let the breath go.  After over one year of operation this computer still runs fine.  It is just as fast as it ever was and I have never had a slow down even though I surf the net a lot and shop on Amazon constantly.  It runs off wifi with no problems and I have connected a Logitech keyboard to it without problems.  Plus, there are a ton of applications with reasonable prices.And I have never bought or ran an anti-virus program on this machine; thus, saving me the cost to clean up the computer every few months and paying for anti-virus software every year.  These cost savings add up, and I think I am saving money over the "cheaper" PC.My wife still uses a PC, but she is starting to think about an Apple.  The cost is hampering her; however, as the PC slows down and a decisions nears to clean it up plus pay another year of anti-virus, or buy something else, she is leaning toward the Apple.  Maybe by Christmas 2012 she will come around and give me a way to buy a present without a lot of thinking.***Update March 2013I have previously reviewed my Apple computers (see above - a laptop and a desktop).  I have written many reviews, but Amazon does not let me search my own reviews by subject to find the review to update it, so I am stuck. I have owned my Apple Macbook Air for a little less than 2 years and the desktop for one year (approximate).My most significant complaint is the exceptionally poor customer service. Even a slight problem can result in infuriating hassles trying to reach Apple or otherwise solve the glitches on line. APPLE GOES TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PREVENT YOU FROM REACHING A HUMAN. Worse, the on line "solutions" are ridiculous, failing to solve even the most common problems. My closest Apple store is in Reno, Nevada about 50 miles away; however, you cannot reach a person at the store by phone. You only get a recording giving directions to the store. This is a specialized Apple Store, not a secondary retailer like Best Buy. Another complete block to human contact.The machines run decently, have few virus problems, and the display is very good. However, they DO suffer from slowdowns over time. When I first bought my Apple laptop it came on and ran instantly - and I mean instantly. Now it takes up to a minute or more to start up. I am having a similar experience with my desktop machine, although the start up for the desktop was never close to instant.Why it is running slower and slower is hard to say. Virus scans and multiple runs of Apple Disk Doctor and disk verifications here at home turn up nothing. I have also erased data on and highly restricted access to Flash programs, among other things. I have updated the operating system with each new update: from Snow Leopard, to Lion, to Mountain Lion. The hard drives on my machines are less than 10 percent full. I can only report that the performance of these machines deteriorates significantly over time.The mere fact that Apple blocks access to human beings is enough to downgrade my rating significantly. The real problem is the people running Apple, they simply have no customer awareness. In addition, the free support for their machine is short and I have found the owners of the local Apple stores an unforgiving lot - even when you purchased the machine from them.The next problem, and this is a HUGE problem, is the availability of programs, and the functioning of programs that are offered. The number of excellent programs available for PC platforms is amazing. They dwarf the number of programs existing for Apple. This especially true in games. The number of first-rate games obtainable for the PC platform is at least triple the availability for Apple. In addition, many of the programs that are available for Apple from outside vendors run poorly. One example of this is the Dragon speech dictation program, which runs very poorly on Apple but very well on PC platforms. There are literally dozens of other examples. Read the software reviews here on Amazon.Another complaint is the worthless Apple keyboard. I have arthritis and using the keyboard is difficult. Aftermarket keyboards do work; however, Apple has several specialized keys not duplicated on aftermarket keyboards. These same keyboards, although excellent in design, exhibit odd anomalies commonly associated with all aftermarket non-Apple products. Of course, "fixing" a laptop keyboard isn't possible. One can plug in another keyboard but that harms the portability of the machine, a key reason to buy a laptop. When I say the keyboard is bad I mean worthless. The keyboard on the machine is nearly unusable for me because of my arthritis. I use an Adesso curved keyboard on my desktop and it works pretty well.After two years of experience with an Apple laptop (and desktop), I cannot recommend Apple. The actual computer itself, and the display, are above standard, and at the price charged they should be; however, everything else is below acceptable standards. For all the virus problems with PC machines, and the necessity to "clear out" the junk accumulating within the programs over time, the PCs run just as fast, cost much less money to buy, have far far more programs available for them, run after market add-ons like keyboards, game controllers, et al, without a glitch, and new programs, products, and games coming out are all written for the PC Platform, not the Apple.And yes I have read all the glowing reviews. I wrote one of them myself after owning the laptop for about six months and I was dumb enough to buy a desktop about a year later; however, time has changed my mind. I am buying my wife a new computer for Christmas, and it will be a PC based platform (Toshiba). She has used PCs for years, and even after my glowing reviews of Apple and my second purchase she would not abandon her old old PC. Guess what? She was right. For all its "problems" the PC platform, and the companies selling the PC platform, have a strong customer orientation that Apple does not have. If you want a company to put YOU first and a machine that runs everything out there, buy a PC.AD2::Alan Dale Daniel::1.0::March 1, 2012
R9ELFYRFC4GD3::The screen is waaaaaay too fragile - do not buy this laptop!::I've purchased two 13" Macbook Airs and thought they were quite well made, which they largely are, except the screen which is incredibly fragile. On my first flight with a MBA, I had a set of earbuds resting on the keyboard and gently closed the lid when I picked up my laptop to get up and the screen immediately cracked. The small crack soon spread throughout the entire screen.When I took it to the Apple store in Bellevue, WA they said the MBA is very durable in general but admitted that the screen is its main weak point and it tends to shatter easily because the glass is incredibly thin. They would not replace my screen despite admitting that it is a design flaw and wanted $450 to repair it. My friends with older Macbook Pros that are beat to heck still work fine, I baby the heck out of my Air and the screen shatters - it wasn't dropped, it wasn't hit, it wasn't abused. I would not buy this laptop for any students, young people, travelers, business users, etc. My iPhones and iPads have been well built, but the Air is not the same level of quality.It is unacceptable for a laptop to be this delicate, none of my previous Thinkpads would have been damaged from this.Apple needs to fix this serious design flaw in their current generation of Macbook Airs.Legendary customer service and quality? Yeah right, what a joke... :-/::Matt S "Matt S"::1.0::February 16, 2012
R2GN2DB6HUULLM::Hook Line and Sinker::It started several years ago when I received an ipod nano from the wife for Christmas.  I always wondered what the buzz about Apple products.  Well..a nano, 2 apple tv's, 2 iPhones, Airport Extreme router, Airport Express, ipod touch and now a macbook air, I can tell you I will never go back to a pc.  This computer is by far the best I have ever owned or even used.  Very sleek, blazing fast and compact.  Not to mention it just works!..No freezing programs error messages etc.  I know apple products are expensive but in the long run its well worth it.  I can't wait to start using this laptop for traveling.  I can now be that "cool guy" I always envied at the coffee shop with the cool looking Mac!::Art Vandelay::5.0::March 1, 2012
R1WE65BX41M5FQ::Macbook Air - new Mac user - very very pleased indeed::I got the i7 256G 13" Air.  I am totally new to Mac after being PC user for past 20 years.  I am an engineer, so always foolishly thought I can't possibly get by with a Mac (duh).  Anyway, I made the switch after so many recent problems with our new laptop at home and my work laptop provided by my employer.  First, the learning curve is there, but nothing that you can't get through after some intensive use.  I have been using my Air daily and intensively for two months without a single crash - I repeat, not a single crash.  The display is great, the speed is phenomenal due to the SSD, I open multiple applications with zero crashes.  I read Kindle books on it, I do my investing online with it, I run huge spreadsheets on it, I read huge PDF files with it, I am writing a book on it, and everything just works.  I am using MS Office for Mac and that has been very, very stable to use.  BTW:  I also got the Thunderbolt display with wireless keyboard and trackpad.  It is seamless - just one cable and voila, I have a 27" display and all my peripherals hooked up to it.  The Air does not even flinch and handles the 27" display flawlessly.  This is especially useful for viewing large spreadsheets, editing video, and things of that nature.Battery life is OK, not great, however.  I could get 7 hours on very low screen brightness doing nothing but word processing, but anything like watching a video will burn up the battery pretty quick.  But the trade off for functionality and speed in a 3 pound wonder is well worth it.  I live my life out of my Air and I barely notice it is there - it is a tool that just works.  There are some tradeoffs you need to deal with in switching to Mac from PC - like webmail through Exchange is much more full-featured in Explorer than through Safari, some flash applications do not work, and a few minor nits.  I love, love the backlit keyboard - just makes sense!  The aluminum case is the bomb - I mean, wow, what nicely assembled product.  No creaks, no flexing, it just feels great in the hand.  The computer restarts from cold in about 15 seconds and wakes from sleep mode in the time it takes to raise the lid.  This means instant productivity.  I only reboot it to accept software updates when needed, otherwise it is always on and I never shut down my applications - the F3 key is awesome to quickly navigate open apps.  Did I mention it is fast, I mean, everything happens nearly instantly.  I can open and view a research-grade 150 page PDF file loaded with spreadsheets, graphs, and images and it just opens it up instantly with zero lag when scrolling from beginning to end.  The trackpad is AMAZING - scrolling an resizing webpages and PDF files is just a great experience (too bad the resize does not work with MS Office for Mac).Why will I never buy a PC again?  Well, after a few days of ownership my Air and Time Capsule crashed and totally locked each other up.  I was really, really mad.  I took it all back to the Apple Store - they said they didn't want to waste my time trying to figure anything out and offered me all brand new hardware on the spot with a full month to decide if I want to still stay with Mac.  So I went home with another brand new Air and a new Time Capsule and everything has worked flawlessly since.  SO, in a word, customer service when you need it is where it is at.  That is why, BTW, I have driven Lexus the past few years - they also know what customer service is all about, at least that has been my good experience.I am pleased, pleased, pleased with my Macbook Air and recommend it without reservation.  If you are new to Mac, do not be afraid, just tell yourself you will have to go through a learning curve and in a few weeks you should be good to go and probably will never look back.  I know nothing about playing games on the Mac vs. PC because I am not a gamer, so no advice on that.Update:  One more thing I would like to add is how I went about my final decision to switch to Apple?  I really wanted to avoid Mac, and tried to convince myself to get another pc - mostly because of lack of experience with Apple (we do have an iPad however, which we also love).  I spent a lot of time between Apple Store and big box stores comparing laptops.  Some big box stores also carry both, so it was easy to compare.  What did I find?  Well, there were maybe 25 pc's on display and I'll bet that 50% of them were locked up with the blue screen of death.  None of the track pads worked consistently on any of them - I tried Vaio and Asus (they have their version of the Air) and it was riddled with operating problems.  In contrast, I never came across an Apple Macbook, Air, or iMac that was not running.  In fact, they all run exactly the same.  Finally, I talked to a few of the techs in the big box stores - they all said they spend each morning trouble-shooting all the crashed pc's, but the Apple products run for months without issues.  I must say my iPad has never had a problem either.  So, that how I made my ultimate decision to switch to Apple.  For the kinds of things I do (mostly office type stuff) I could not tell the difference between the Air and the Pro - so I went for portability, and with the Thunderbolt display it is almost an iMac!Follow-up:  Now in my 15th month of ownership, I must say the Macbook Air continues to impress!  In general, this computer has been "on" since I bought it and has never crashed or hung-up.  I only have rebooted for system updates, speaking of which, are seamless every time.  It has never ever crashed.  Let me repeat that - EVER!  Now that is amazing.  My wife has since gotten an identical Macbook Air that we bought as a refurb through Apple store.  I use this laptop every day and it travels with me every day.  I also switched to a Macbook Pro at work, the wife and I both have iphone 5, and our 8 year old daughter has an ipod 4thG.  None of these devices has ever crashed.  This is so amazing to me after so many years of pc nonsense.  Needless to say, I am now a bonafide Apple nut!  The new Macbook Pro with Retina is the bomb, but for routine use like email, spreadsheets, powerpoint, web, photos, video chat, etc. you can't beat the MBA for portability and lightweight.  As a side note, we are having some problems with the hard drive on our time capsule router, but that is under warranty, fully realizing that any hard drive running continuously is prone to failure.  Solid state all the way baby!  Apple rocks.  Period.::MKOW::5.0::February 24, 2012
R6IMCHX1JPYSO::mac air 13::Excellent piece of hardware, fast start up, good battery life, mine went up to 5 hours with mediumusage like browsing and occasional you tube videos. This laptop is very portable and lightweight.But the only issue I had is the screen size, this 13 inch screen was a deal breaker for me,using this for more than 2 hours causes my eyes to strain, even changing fonts did not help much.Also working through remote connection to desktops is almost impossible due to this small screen size.If apple comes up with a 15 inch screen for air next year I might go for that.So this one is going back as I don't want another show piece sitting beside the ipad doing nothing.::Anik::4.0::December 14, 2011
RDWJ3RKOUL21G::Macbook Air 2011: Great value, and powerful ultraportable.::PROs:- The Macbook Air 2011 equipped with a powerful Intel SB ULV processor, and a Samsung SSD is blazing fast for everyday and office usage. The computer boots in 14 seconds and shuts down in 4, programs open instantly, and the entire feel is extremely smooth.- Intel HD 3000 Graphics fare okay in games; they seem to handle Valve games (even the newest ones such as Portal 2 and HL2E2) well. Other games can be played on native resolution at medium settings.- The battery life at 50% and light-medium usage is 7 hours, but it can be easily extended to 8+ hours by turning down the brightness. At maximum brightness and medium usage, the battery life is 5:30 minutes.- Also to mention is the absolutely dazzling design; the device is remarkably thin and light; and it looks beautiful and sturdy at the same time. It's important to note that the wifi problem has been fixed with the new Mac update (10.7.2).- The Macbook Air fares well versus similar competitors; it is actually priced lower than most of its competitors (except the Lenovo Ultrabook - which really does not offer the same level of performance and design).Con:- When using the laptop in an intensive task it does become noticeably hot and noisy - nothing extreme, but definitely noticeable.I have been using the laptop for nearly 3 months now, and I have to say that I am absolutely impressed, and recommend it greatly over any of its competitors for anyone looking for a powerful ultra-portable laptop. Also to note that while this was my first Mac, it took little time to become used to it.::Al G::5.0::October 20, 2011

R1Q4EUJRM9NZAO::Absolutely Fantastic::This compute is absolutely the cream of the crops. I purchased this MacBook air and the 13 inch MacBook pro and compared them exhaustively and finally decided to keep the MacBook air and here is why. This computer has a wayyyyy faster SSD drive which translates to programs starting up almost instantly, faster start up times and way faster sleep times, with the MacBook pro it takes a couple of seconds for it to go to sleep which might be a problem if you want to grab the computer and hit the road instantly and the storage I thought would be a real issue but i found it to be not a problem at all for me since I have a portable external drive. The most important deciding factor for me was the screen. This has a much better screen that the MacBook pro, it has a much higher resolution that makes MacBook pros almost fuzzy(you have to see them side by side and it will be hard to choose the MacBook pro after seeing the airs screen) it has much higher contrast ratio but i have to say MacBook pro has a little bit brighter screen but this has way deeper blacks which makes MacBook pros black level almost grey. (I tested and calibrated both of them with Xrite I1 Display Pro) MacBook airs contrast ratio was 814:1 compared to 620:1 for the MacBook pro. the only advantage MacBook pro has is color gamut which to be honest isn't really noticeable after you calibrate the screens. Overall I think MacBook airs screen is the next best after retina display MacBook pro in the MacBook line. Asus UX31A has a better display which is an IPS panel, but to me and IPS panel is not really that necessary for a laptop as it is for a tablet since you won't be changing your position very often but i have to mention that MacBook airs screen has very good viewing angles even though it is a TN panel. In my opinion MacBook airs advantages far outweigh its disadvantages compared to the Asus, specially once you consider how amazing trackpad and keyboard are on this little machine. This is the first time I have switched to mac and it is exactly what i thought it would be, an operating system that is straightforward user friendly and not riddled with problems like windows 7 and can serve users form amateur to advanced levels. I feel like i can multitask way more efficiently than i ever have on windows(I used to have a Sony VPC laptop with a standard voltage Core I5) and I absolutely love the ram memory management which makes even the most tedious tasks such as running photoshop CS6 final cut pro x, chrome with dozen of tabs open iPhoto, Skype, etc. makes it feel like you have way more than 4GBs of ram.This is the laptop to get if you don't feel like the retina pros are worth the dough, I highly recommend this laptop and with amazing resale values of macs i feel like this is a bargain.::ferrari 458::5.0::December 3, 2012
R3B6J3PO1UN8OR::A Star Is Born::Now that my world is firmly entrenched with my iPhone and iPad, getting an Apple computer system, as opposed to my old stand-by, a PC which I have used for some 30 years - seemed logical.I tried Mac before and had to come around very slowly as it seemed, at the time, a bit on the slow and clunky side.  Well, that was then and this is now.Weighing 2 pounds (but it feels more like 2 ounces), the MacBook Air is a sleek and classy piece.  But looks aren't everything and it was not until I turned on the power that the true genius that went into the creation of this product finally became clear.It looked for my home WiFi.  It found it.  It took my picture, asked me a few harmless questions and then - in what seemed like a few seconds - the MacBook Air was ready.  Set up and just begging to be taken for a test drive.The backlit keyboard was the first boon I noticed. The ease of the trackpad (and I am not a trackpad fan) was next.  Could this machine do no wrong?Within the first hour, it seemed as if I had owned the MacBook Air for years.  It had a natural flow and everything was easy to find. If you have just a bit of computer know-how, you'll be up and running in no time with this baby.Recalling my days of dialing help desks, re-reading documentation for set up, etc. was now a dim and distant memory.  I was downloading drivers for my year old printer and had it connected via the wi fi system in less than five minutes (it took much, much longer when I had installed the same drivers on a PC).Yes, the fact that there is no CD drive did make me stop a few times but in today's world, everything you need is an app or downloadable from a web site.  If you can find your wi fi, you can have this wonderful computer fully loaded.It's that easy and that good.::Joseph Albanese "The Joe Show"::5.0::February 21, 2012
R3V4D4Z1RYHP52::The most comfortable laptop I have ever used.::Yes, it's expensive if you only consider tech specs like processor power, RAM, GPU, etc. But if you buy Apple, you don't buy specs, you buy "user experience", you buy design (both hardware and OS/software). And the MacBook Air certainly delivers.::Amazon Customer::5.0::February 11, 2012

R3AFDJ0OM9G7E7::Love This Laptop::I bought a refurbished 256GB version online and used it for 2 weeks. During this time I also bought a Samsung Series 9. I returned the series 9 within a day because the trackpad didn't work as well and the series 9 just didn't feel as well constructed.I kept the MBA for 2 weeks and used it everyday. I returned it because I started feeling guilty for spending so much on a computer when something cheaper would suffice.3 days after I returned the MBA, I realized I couldn't live without the exceptional build and uncompromising design that I love about Apple products.On another note, the refurbished MBA had the Toshiba SSD and my current MBA has the Samsung SSD.

I'll never use another computer with a hard drive again.  This 13" MacBook air is so light it's amazing and the 13" screen size is perfect for sitting on the couch and getting a little work done.

The 13 in model is large enough for everything I do.  I like how fast the software works and using two or three fingers to swipe the pages now seems so natural that I don't miss a mouse at all.  The only disappointment was in transferring music from iTunes in my older laptop to my new Mac Air.  So much of my music wouldn't transfer because of restrictions.

R1KQM40ML064ZU::17th is the charm....::Over the years I've counted 17 laptops in my lifetime so far including Dells, Asus, Lenovo, Toshiba, and Apple (including a 160, Duo230 and a 5300 among many others), this Air though...is by far the best improvement from any of the previous models, period. Whether it's the SSD (talk about opening software in mere seconds) or the super slim, featherweight design (wow), or the exceptional battery life (yes I know it's new, but it has beaten all others out of the box by a few hours already) - overall this is a great system. I did buy an extra AC adapater, a 3-port usb/ethernet adapter and a Thunderbolt/display adapter as well, as I use these at work, still, I just leave them at work for when I need them, no need to carry them around. Had no problem installing software without a DVD. Lion is a wonderful, well thought of OS. After using XP, Windows7, and the other assorted OSX systems by Apple, this is a solid migration pushing the boundaries between iPads and the like. As a note I have yet to get an iPhone or iPad...I'm an Android fan at the moment. Although to me this is a solid player and fits my personal and business life perfectly, there are some people that this laptop will not satisfy (those doing heavy graphics, or needing/wanting larger screenspace for instance), but for those looking for a solid, light (did I say light), dependable machine, here it is.::SilverArrow::5.0::August 8, 2011

I am getting 4.5 - 5 hours of battery life on average.  The screen quality I feel is pretty good and I did not experience any kind of anomalies with color etc.My only complaints are that the machine has no FW800 ports and does not feature USB 3 a new and growing format.

R1S32VSAEQ7H30::Ultimate Portable Computer::I ordered MBA 13" with 256 SSD and 1.8 i7 CPU,early morning on first day of its release ! What is the most important attribute for a laptop? "Portability". What are the second and third important attributes of a laptop? "Battery life" and "Powerful CPU" !this is now about 10 days I work with it, it scores 100% in all ! I dual boot with Win7 works perfectly. No problem with screen, Wireless, Bluetooth at all. Very smooth and fast,I run heavy computations and multiple applications without any problem. Of course one can argue it can not be quite your main machine, but it is a perfect portable computer.update 8/23/11:!) I noticed some people had problem with WiFi connection, I did not have problem thus far it might be a defect with some series, however I had disconnection of bluetooth which seemed resolved after Lion update.2) I installed VMware Fusion and virtualize the Boot Camp partition so I can boot into Win7 both from Boot Camp and from VM machine without rebooting, it is very cool and convenient. I gave VMware 2 RAM and 2 CPUs, works very well.3) Playing Flash generate more heat than other applications!::Amir Gahremanpour::5.0::August 5, 2011
R3GPPHABOXQMWN::Great Macbook!::The new macbook air is great! I just picked up this exact model today at the Apple Store.  The screen is brilliant and the speed is amazing (i5 processor)  But I would recommend buying it at the apple store...i paid $1299.00 and received a free HP printer and $100 iTunes gift card.::WV35::5.0::July 23, 2011
R14YFZWHBV56DB::MacBook Air Time::I did a lot of research before I purchased this. I have a 17" MacBook Pro for my office but needed something a little smaller when I'm in the bedroom watching TV. It is great!::helmut13::5.0::November 25, 2011
R2I8BZHT503DRW::One statisfied PC User::I am application Developer ( web,desktop, and now hand-held gadgets) who was grown on PC (windows).Wanted something very light, small yet powerful with a decent resolution. Well would'nt yah know its a mac!!!.Now I do all my work on this baby. The 1.7Ghz proc is decent enough to accomplish all the my tasks ( Photoshop,Flash,Flash Builder,Visual Studio 2010,Flash Develop )...knock on wood :) and if I need more screen real estate ... hook it up to my 3 yr old  24" Dell (Yes Dell ..they make the best mid level professional series monitors).I must admit I was hesitant at first....but this machine had great reviews....and you know what those reviewers weren't lying.Whats amazing is how zippy it feels thanks to the SSD. This is a blessing (the speed) and a curse (the limited size of 128GB).To remove the curse what I did was only install my programs and everthing else is on external hard drive . Not a bad compromise I think.Oooo ..all my dev programs by the way are run under Windows 7. Yeah...I dual boot....but its great...no problems there...I have yet to feel a reduction in performance.Its amazing how quickly Photoshop (under windows)opens up....sweeet.For my first real dive into world of Mac, OSX Lion is ok (the new gestures,launchpad etc are great actually ) but I'm too sucked in by Windows 7 to leave it (everything is fullscreen ..yeah!!!!)..so..sorry guys ...(u know yourselves).My only real concern tho is after a lot of GPU intensive stuff like videos for example it gets warm at the very back and you hear the whine of the fan... a tad bit loud if you ask me.But hey ..its an i5 cpu in there and the package is crazy small so heat + small fan + crammed notebook shell = a little fan noise...not a deal breaker but its why my review is 4 stars.For me, hardware wise, nobody else makes a product as good as this (yes.. yes I know about Samsung 9 Series...I hate the sheen and low res screen) and quality will always cost you a little more...I'm satisfied!!!::sean o. watson::4.0::August 11, 2011
RD3QT1LWGZMMV::Macbook Air Disappointment::I was really disappointed with this item, as it lasted for six hours and the battery died - for good. Unfortunately, I had taken it out of the country at that stage, so I had to leave it into an Apple resellers, who have had it now for almost a week. First day, they did nothing with it, as they were all on a training course. Second day, they ran diagnostics on it which lasted for most of the day. Third day, they decide its the battery (doh!) and place one on order from Apple. All this, and the laptop was only a few days old. They didn't even think to let me know all this. I had to call several times myself. So much for Apple care. I'll be thinking twice before buying Apple. I never had this trouble with a laptop before and I have bought numerous brands, both for myself and my family.::AMMCD::3.0::November 10, 2011
R3NF6XPVQ9MNC2::Be carefull on exchange policy::I got my new Mac Air and it was minor scratch on the touchpad which cause the pad is not even. When using the pad, I felt something on the pad. I was requesting for exchange via Amazon.com but was unable to exchange. Amazon.com requested me to return and get a new one which the price is even higher. It does not make sense that I got a defected one and even have to pay higher price to get the good one. Disappointed on how they handled the defective product.::CY::1.0::January 3, 2012

R3V6AFUR4SH3C8::Do NOT buy from Amazon...::I bought this item in November as a Christmas present. I was very excited to give it as a gift and when the person opened it on Christmas morning... it was pretty amazing! THEN we tried using it. It wouldn't stay connected to the internet, and we were not able to transfer the info from another laptop to the new one. (probably because of the internet issues) After looking at recent reviews, other people were having problems with it as well. I took it to the Apple Store and they were ready to swap it out, until they found out I purchased it from Amazon. Then they wouldnt touch it. They said it was a known problem and the logic board was causing wifi issues. Certain serial number Macbook Airs all have the same problem. They could repair it for me, but then it would be a refurbished computer that I just purchased at full price.So I have to return it to Amazon who wount replace it because they are out of stock, and wait for it to be returned (UPS Ground) and wait 3-5 days for the refund and then re-purchase the computer and wait for the shipping back to me. Merry Christmas! Here is your new computer for you to receive in February! Enjoy.Amazon doesnt offer expedited returns and when I called and explained my story the lady (Britannie W) sounded like she couldnt care less. She didn't say Im sorry once or offer free delivery when I re-purchased it... not a thing.My advise is to but it from Apple. Sure, you are paying $30 more than the Amazon price, but when it winds up faulty... they will take care of you. Amazon can not say the same.::Matty H.::1.0::January 2, 2012

No power, no nothing. Off to apple repair.Locked into RAM and everything else.  Very little is user accessible.VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUY AND OWN.Think long and hard before you invest.UPDATE:  I took my Mac to the local apple store.

R1VD0XPTSWYBZA::nice piece of engineering but Windows for me.::At ASUS Zenbook was more expensive than Apple Macbook Air, I thought my decision was an easy one. I bought Apple and regret it since then. Obviously it is constructed beautifully but there are many flaws as I see it . The biggest drawback was mousepad. Yes it has pinch zoon,smooth surface but when you actually want to choose something you have to press down that very firm mousepad all the time. Windows laptops allow a tap on the pad to make the selection but not apple. It is a major major draw back . Wifi is very weak for connection too. I can't get the connection from my dinning room while my Android phones are connected to the same wifi network even further away from there in my house. The display isn't sharp enough for me and my 2 yrs old Android tablet has better display. I don't really understand why people are so hyped about this Apple product as it's not definitely for me. Waking up time from sleep , my Dell inspiron 1545 wake up faster and connect faster to Wifi than Macbook Air and My Dell laptop was just over $500 when I bought it. Unless you like touching the frosty cold laptop in the morning,it's not very pleasant for me at all. Palm rest are cold enough to deter you from entirely enjoying using the product. Cut and Paste was simple and done on my Dell but Macbook Air needs the short cut keys to do the job and you know you can't navigate the laptop on short cut keys so have to use mousepad again. Let me conclude it very simple, my old Dell has very easy and reliable mousepad over this Macbook Air. I can zoom on it with one finger ( not two ) , I can scroll on it with one finger ( not two ) , I can make it choose items on display by no effort tapping on the pad or easy pressing left mouse key ( not pressing down the whole mousepad like Macbook Air) , Dell wakes up faster from sleep and no SSD in it like Apple , this good old Dell has backlit LED screen which are as sharper as this Macbook Air..I think I made myself clear about my regrets on this Macbook Air..good luck to you all..::Aussie From Sydney::1.0::May 10, 2012
R1OQ9B5EW83V68::NEWEST MACBOOK AIR 13.3 i5 processor Lion OS FROM A NEW APPLE USER::I am new to Mac...I have owned a Mac book Pro for nearly 5 months...They are not as intuitive as Apple would have you think,  but I have learned to use Mac.....Happily Apple is using 2nd Gen. Intel i processors as they are incredibly fast in any good computer... Both of my Mac's, using i5's and my Windows 7 with Quad core and i7 processors run at lightening speed......I have not as of yet had connectivity issues with MBA ***SEE LAST PARAGRAPH***......I cannot remember the last time I used an optical drive and don't miss it...Because I am new to Mac I only know Lion and Snow Leopard OS ... I will not slam PC's or the Windows 7 operating system as it works well. I don't understand why Mac users insist on comparing their new Mac to an old Windows XP or Vista. Its not comparable and most have never owned Windows 7... Having said that,  I am liking Mac.... I'm not thrilled that Mac's are double the price of most PC's. Thankfully I can afford Macbook Air.....No problems with Lion OS ...Lightening fast boot up..MBA does not run hot as there is no hard drive....It may be the fastest computer I've ever used....They are  light as a feather..Backlit keys.. I am loving MBA's solid state drive. I'ts quite impressive.....This laptop is a pleasure to use.. It's a wonderful web surfer.........What I do notice is Mac users are snobs........Apple and apple users SERIOULSY,  get over yourself.... Hopefully this review is helpful to others that are new to Apple and trying to learn this system, which WILL take some time and effort  or for folks that are considering spending $1400.00 on MBA which is really an expensive netbook......****BUT*** if you are happy with PC and Windows 7 and cannot afford the hefty price tag on the newest MacBooks in these troubled times, stay with PC and Windows 7.  I highly recommend  i3/i5/i7 Intel processors....TWO STARS  because Mac users are incredibly pompous and rude, ** SEE COMMENT SECTION**  the product is overpriced with EXPENSIVE customer service ...........THREE STARS for the beautifully, aestetically designed MacBookAir, that just today dropped an internet signal 3 times in 10 minutes and continues to drop signals...HOW YA LIKE THEM APPLES...****I humbly have had a change of heart...see my comment toward the end of the string of comments....*****::L.

R1OUU15IY4C0IJ::Think before buying home::Please take a serious concern before you buy a macbook air:Pros:look for the details on apple web siteCons:1. sensitive with water, 10 drops of water on keyboard may cause damages2. definitely no warranty on water caused damages, the apple technician will not accept any excuses what the level of the water damages. few drops are enough3. horrible customer service in IFCMy macbook air, purchased around 1 and half month, suffered a low degree water damage. This damage hurt ONLY the KEYBOARD Function but not more than that. Yesterday, I brought my macbook to apple genius bar in IFC. I totally understand that water damages is not covered on warranty and just looked for the fix price of the computer. The technician,CHESTER WONG ('''), a fat ass with little white hair (whose the name I can't never forget in my life),just spend not more than 5 MINUTES DIAGNOSIS to diagnose my computer was total. I tried to provide some suggestions such as whether it is possible to fix the keyboard only, or to provide me any other ways to fix the computer.He rejected all of my requests and just said, 'I feel you but I can't do nothing for that, maybe you better buy a new one'. What amazing is the computer still works and he rejected provide any aids on it in accordance with his hypothesis (that regard to his professional 5 mins diagnose). And he for sure knew that the computer was purchased not more than 2 months. How he felt me? I am pretty sure he is cold blood!!! and he also did not provide any help to me (probably I am not a female)4. complicated online support:The story is not the end. I dropped down has name and tried to find the way to make my opinion on his service (complaint actually). But, as the result, I found that apple doesn't provide any ways for store feedback; the phone number of IFC does not work, online service number is different department, and the online feedback site is in error, and no feedback area for store service....I just felt regret last whole night.I am still looking for a feedback page for leaving my opinions of ''' service. so.... Please let me know If YOU KNOW THE WAY TO MAKE FEEDBACK FOR STORE SERVICE.  Thanks x 100::kwan yu chan::1.0::October 18, 2011
R39KU47F19JSDI::It is a piece of crap::I have been a Windows user for many years. I bought this macbook thinking that Mac is supposed to be easy to use. This is far from truth. Apple product is disappointing. I was shocked. It is a good looking toy, but it has no quality. I used iMovie to create movies from slides. I found out that it was impossible to finalize the results in HD. You can google "imovie heap zone". You will read that there have been so many complaints for so many months, yet till today, Apple has not addressed it. I am shocked that any company could actually release such a lousy software that has memory management issue. This is not even intermittent issue. This is a broken software or maybe hardware.I also found out that the DVD creator software, iDVD, is nowhere to be found. As far as I am concerned, this laptop is a very expensive paper weight. DO NOT BUY this piece of crap.By the way, I have never encountered any issue with using Windows software to create slide shows. Sure, it is not very good looking, but it is DONE.::WT::1.0::April 13, 2012
RHU73HH0PKW02::BUYER BEWARE!::MacBook Air is to MacBook Pro as Volkswagen Beetle is to Mercedes Benz.  This massively stripped down version is more than a major disappointment.  What you supposedly gain in the marketing platitudes of "lighter, slimmer, faster" is crap.  Here's what they DON'T tell you.  No internal CD/DVD... purchase separately... do you really want to lug this unit around with you?  Inadequate ventilation... over heats... shuts down... requires external booster.  Do you want to lug this around too?  Operating system?  SAME.  Software and Apps?  SAME!  User friendly? NOT!  Definitely demands more Tech Support.  (Thank God for Tech Support!  Them's that can function beyond the menu will apologize and honestly tell you the same thing.)  Why pay more for less?  BEFORE YOU BUY download the USER'S MANUAL.  Great read.  A real eye opener.

RFDNTJO0P84FE::I USED TO READ...::This Macbook Air Is Too Fast! Normally When I Start Up My Computer, I Have Time To Read A Chapter In My Book Before I Can Get To My Email Now I Cant Even Read One Page!?!?!?!?! This Mac Has Stopped Me From Reading!::BOOK READER::1.0::December 3, 2011
RQHMF0YIR7TMH::I guess I am a Mac after all...::I recently made the switch from PC to Mac, and I can say that I'm not sure why I waited so long.  Considering that I have only had my computer a few weeks I can't say much about the durability and longevity of the hardware, but I can say that the operating system (mine shipped with Lion) and software is top notch.I labored for a long time trying to decide whether the 13" MacBook Pro (MBP) or MacBook Air was the right choice for me.  I liked the form factor, screen resolution and weight of the Air, but couldn't get comfortable with the comparatively small hard drive and the RAM fixed at 4GB.  Considering these factors along with the significant price premium for an Air, I decided that the MBP was right for me.I also thought long and hard about whether to go with the base model with the 2.4Ghz i5 processor and 500 GB HDD or the 2.8Ghz i7 processor with the 750GB HDD.  after looking at reviews and benchmark tests I decided that for my uses, the less expensive model would be perfect and that the incremental added performance of the more expensive model is not worth the additional cost.  When large solid state drives become more affordable I will probably switch my HDD out, but until then 500GB should provide plenty of storage.I opted to get my computer locally, but purchased the Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339) from Amazon for a great price.  Once I got my computer home I installed the RAM in 10 minutes, start to finish.  If you are planning this upgrade just be sure that you have the right Phillips head screwdriver.After using this computer for the past few weeks and carrying it on weekly business trips I am very pleased with my choice of computers.  It handles the Microsoft office suite flawlessly, and the added ram allows me to open and view very large pdf files without any lag.  I have done minor video and photo editing on this computer and it performed very well.  The added weight compared to theAir hasn't proven to be too noticeable, but I am a big guy at 6'4" and 210 pounds.So far I am pleased with this computer and my Mac experience overall.  The process of learning a new OS and overall user interface was daunting at first, but Apple has done a great job creating a system that is intuitive and easy to learn.I would recommend this computer to anyone looking for a new laptop that they expect to have for awhile and would like to be able to customize to fit their needs.UPDATE 5/29/12: I have been using my MBP for six months now and couldn't be happier with it.  I may have been lucky enough to get a great unit, but during the time that I have owned my MBP I have NEVER needed to contact technical support.  I use my Mac for my primary business computer every day and have traveled extensively with it.Aside from its performance and reliability the feature that I like most about my Mac is the multi-touch trackpad.  By using gestures on the trackpad I can be very efficient, and I'm not sure that I will ever be able to go back to a regular mouse or trackball.One addition that I made was to get the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter MB570Z/A to attach a second monitor when I'm at the office.  This allows me to use both my MBP monitor and an external, which provides me with much more area when using Excel or other programs and also allows me to keep my mailbox visible when working on other things.Considering how pleased I am with my Mac, I have a feeling that I will be buying a lot more Apple products in the future.::H.

R3PU0HQTGMMP6N::MD 314LL/A 2.8 GHz, 750 GB HDD::The reviews here are for the MD313LL/A, yet the computer is actually MD314LL/A, which has a faster processor and bigger hard drive.The MD314LL/A features a 2.8 GHz i7 processor, integrated Intel 3000 graphics and a 750 GB hard drive.  I've never owned an Apple laptop before, so there was a little bit of a learning curve.  Now that I'm getting the hang of it, I'm beginning to like OSX Lion better than Windows.  Programs can be run on separate virtual desktops, and the computer never misses a beat when several programs are active.  Switching between different desktops or open programs can be done by merely sliding three fingers forward on the large touchpad.  Control-clicking on words or phrases in Safari brings up a context sensitive menu which allows the user to select to view a dictionary, Wikipedia, or do a Google search in a pop-up window in the browser. You can also ask the computer to speak the word or phrase, if you have any doubts about pronunciation.  Safari also includes links to a library of plug-ins at extensions.apple.com, which includes a plug-in for Flash, so you can now watch free Hulu videos and other videos online.  The network preferences window makes it far easier than Windows to set up a list of public DNS servers to bypass the sometimes slow, glitchy ISP servers.This computer is completely silent. I wasn't even sure it had a cooling fan until I downloaded a utility to monitor the fan speed.  This computer is super fast, and the base plate never gets more than lukewarm.  The light weight, small footprint, lighted keyboard, crisp screen and speed really make this computer shine.The attention to detail is really outstanding.  The cooling vents on the back of the base are completely covered by a sliding plate when the lid is closed, keeping dust out of the innards. The power supply has flip out legs for winding the cord for storage and the prongs can be removed so it can be used as a brick type supply with the supplied AC cord. The computer also has a green LED battery status gauge built into the left side of the base, which is activated by a flush button.  The lid snaps shut quietly even though there are no cheesy stick-on rubber bumpers, and it is held closed by magnets. The built in light sensor shuts off the keyboard backlighting and brightens the display in bright ambient light. The computer also has a 3 axis accelerometer to protect the hard drive from damage. The attention to detail is why Macs are more expensive than the various PC clones.::Steelers Fan::5.0::November 13, 2011

R3OTAITBXQBU8P::No longer an apple hater::Packaging:Very impressed with the packaging. I was very impressed how well this thing was packaged. A well thought-out design protects the content and minimizes customer dissatisfaction.First impression:I am sure everyone who are interested to buy this product, has gone to best buy and played with it a bit. well, the new MBP right out of the box is 90% more impressive and attractive than that of the store. It is a good looking piece of machine.It came with a charger, extension cord for the charger, instruction book, screen wipe, and nothing more that I needed. I took the cord out, and started charging it. A full charging is highly recommended before use. after a few setup screens, I am up and running.Upgrade time:(Make sure you shut down your machine first)I ordered this machine with a 8GB memory upgrade (DDR3-1333) from Crucial. I did not want to pay a premium for the apple upgrade. Instead, I bought a dual channel kit separately for $39.00. I highly recommended Crucial brand as they use Samsung memory chips and for one more reason I am telling you next. I will not go through how to change the memory(a lot of youtube videos available). when I took out the existing memory out of the MBP, guess what chips they use on the memory sticks? yes, guessed it right, samsung.And I also have reasons to believe that the RAMs are OEM version of crucial memory judging by physical similarities. but, that is just my opinion, not a fact.User Experience:After the upgrade, turned on the machine and few beeps and clunks later, it started flying. I repeat, it is flying and my machine is currently running over 600 threads without any sign of slowing down. virtual box? NO PROBLEMO! this little beauty is a little beast in performance. I have installed over 50 applications, running dozens simultaneously, 10 more browser windows open, and it just happy. I can't say enough about the multi-touch gestures. No other laptop I have ever used that had such ease of switching between applications, scrolling, searching, sliding  and navigating. I have never used Mac OS before(not more than a few minutes of playing around at best buy), and I felt it was very intuitive to use and learned fairly quickly. I still don't know a lot about the OS, but it has not stopped me from doing what I need to do.What could be better:Not that I cared much, but the standard power cord is a little short. I bought a sleeve to keep it safe, and it does not allow room for the extension cord that comes with it(big and bulky).It has good speakers that play nice sounding beats. But the 15" plays them better.The outer shell is aluminium, but don't think you can't scratch it. I spent a sleepless night just cause it put a small scratch under it by accident. But, I am over it now.Advice to the people who wants to take the plunge:I felt like it was the best $1100 I spent on a laptop. I could not justify it before using it as I always thought that Mac is more style than performance and usefulness. I admit that I was wrong. This machine offers more features and performance per dollar than I thought. This is a well-built machine that would serve me longer than any other laptop ever has for me. I have half a dozen windows machines in my house including a 990X extreme desktop that I built 4 months ago. I love windows, but I have learned that I can like both (Macbook pro and PC).::FAISAL::4.0::December 28, 2011
R19J6AYWHH36KO::MacBook Pro: Think Different::Steve Jobs had returned to Apple, which had been a struggling company, and it was time to align it once again with world of creative users.  In 1997 an ad was run with actor Richard Dreyfuss reading the voiceover, which began with: "Here's to the Crazy Ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently." Think Different... that was the 1997 slogan and theme for Apple's comeback to the world of serious computing after the return of Steve Jobs, and perhaps it was a cynical reference to IBM's famous "Think" slogan.  Whatever it was, this was the ad campaign that restored Apple's reputation under the leadership of the late Steve Jobs.Take this MacBook Pro review as one from a dedicated Windows PC user who made the switch awhile ago, with time enough to put it through its paces, to do side-by-side comparisons.  I've owned a Mac before, back in the day of the Macintosh SE, and though I found it to be extremely useful for desktop publishing in the days when Aldus PageMaker reigned supreme in that area, I saw things blend as Microsoft slowly got its act together, for the most part.  When it came time to upgrade back then, I stuck with the Windows PCs... until recently, when I found the need to diversify a bit.To make this easy for those who just want to get to the facts quickly, I'll list the positive and negative points that I've personally found with the MacBook Pro first, then elaborate with details a bit further on.  Please also remember that these are coming from a satisfied Windows 7 PC user, and one with multiple computers.◆ MacBook Pro Positives:+ Well thought-out packaging, easy out of the box setup+ Excellent build quality, unparalleled detail in workmanship+ Superb aluminum unibody chassis construction, has a good solid feel+ Sharp 13.3-Inch backlit display, first-rate 1280-by-800 Resolution+ Screen display has excellent color resolution and contrast for photos+ First class backlit keyboard, easy to use in low-light situations+ Very fast boot up even with password protection enabled+ Proven Mac OS X operating system; based on UNIX (like a server)+ Built-in SD card slot; great for transferring photos to computer+ Responsive ergonomic multi-touch trackpad; no buttons, excellent cursor control+ Well-engineered 60W power adapter with decent cable management system+ Automated incremental backups with Time Machine, works with almost any external HDD◆ In Between:± Claimed 7 hour battery life; 5-6 hours is more like it, depending on the apps that you're running◆ Negatives:- No built-in HDMI or VGA output, adapters must be purchased separately- Only 2 USB 2.0 ports, and they are too close together◆ The Details:We each have our reasons for the computers that we own.  Mine were primarily to have a compact yet sturdy platform for word processing, accessing the Internet, and digital photo processing.  That stated, there's little to not like about this MacBook Pro.  The Intel Dual-Core Processor is fast and efficient, and even better than the Pentium Dual-Core 2.20GHz processor on my Windows 7 notebook PC.  It's one thing to see it in the store, but when one gets it home and takes it out of the well-designed box, it's apparent that this is a better grade computer than might have been anticipated.  The first thing that is noticed once it's unwrapped is the workmanship.  The unibody main enclosure, constructed from a single block of aluminum, is proof of this attention to detail and it helps add to its durability.The 13-inch backlit LCD display is sharp, and has the excellent color resolution and contrast that I need, especially when working with photos.  The glossy screen actually helps to see images with their full clarity.  Using both Adobe software apps and Nikon Capture NX 2, having clear and sharp resolution is an absolute necessity, and this MacBook Pro offers that.  The backlit keyboard is a pleasure to use, and quite functional in low-light mobile locations.  I'm also very impressed with the quick boot up, even with the password startup screen enabled, a security necessity when at some mobile locations.It's hard to fault OS X in any way.  This operating system is UNIX-based, and therein lays its strength, along with its ability to run 64-bit applications.  It works right out of the box without fiddling or tweaking.  It's far better than Mac OS 9 and its predecessors, and the security while on the `Net is reassuring.The tiny built-in SD card slot has proven itself to be good for transferring photos from the digital cameras to the computer.  I've also used it to transfer other media files and documents between computers in a pinch.  It took awhile to get used to the trackpad, with its so-called "multi-touch gestures," but once mastered it's easy to use.  Must admit that I do revert to using a mouse when using the computer at home... call it years of conditioning.This computer really shines with the inclusion of the Time Machine application, and I was happy to find that I could use a reasonable priced off-the-shelf hard drive to do automated incremental backups.  I have a Toshiba 500 GB USB Portable Hard Drive, and all I did was reformat it to HFS+ Journaled file system to use the Time Machine backup software.  It works like a champ.The external 60W power adapter is well engineered and keeps my computer running cooler than PC notebooks with internal power supplies.  I appreciate the magnetic DC connector as it pops off easily if some klutz trips on the cord, necessitating a costly repair as I found out when someone did that to one of my PC notebooks.  The LED in the connector head helps: amber it's charging, green it's charged; very simple and effective.◆ Other Notes:The battery life being less than advertised I can live with.  I would have expected HDMI and/or VGA output to be built-ins with a computer of this quality.  But I have yet to buy the adapters.  But to have only two built-in USB 2.0 ports is irritating, and those are too close together.  Problem solved with an external 4-port ISB adapter, so that issue is closed.I have had issues with laptop carrying bags in the past, and now carry my MacBook Pro in a ThinkTank Artificial Intelligence 15 V. 2.0 Laptop Bag.  I picked this one over many others from heavy experience with photo gear, and know that Think Tank makes exceptionally good pro gear.  It protects my computer from the elements quite well, holds more gear than I can explain here (I have reviewed it), and can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their MacBook with the kind of case that it really deserves.Browser note: I've used the included Safari browser, but my de-facto standard remains Google Chrome.  Safari is a decent browser, but because I find it necessary to synchronize my email on the Mac, the PCs and even one older Linux-based notebook (it's a geek/support thing), Chromes just works better, and I find it faster.  Your experiences may differ, so try whichever works for you.I'm running Office for Mac 2011 and have found its interface to be even better than Microsoft Office 2010 or 2007 on the PC.  Didn't know if the implementation of Outlook for Mac 2011 would be better than Entourage, which was buggy, but Outlook turned out to be excellent, and it's become my mainstay over the PC version.Heat is an issue that I had heard of by some, yet I have not experienced.  The heat level is better than my old HP, Compaq or Dell, and far better than my VAIO (which was very bad).  The only one that has been better heat-wise is my current ASUS notebook running Windows 7, but not by much.  Had been tempted to get a keyboard skin for general protection in the field, but heard that these interfere with the ventilation, so that idea has been tabled for the present.◆ Future:I may upgrade to 8GB of RAM, which has been recommended by a number of people if and when system performance issues arise.  The RAM upgrades are quite reasonable, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it runs with the standard 4 GB at this point.◆ [Updated 3/10/2014]This MacBook Pro has been in continuous use for over two years now. In the summer of 2012 I did the memory upgrade to 8GB of RAM using the Crucial 8GB (4GBx2) Kit in anticipation of the OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) release. Detailed notes of what I did can be found on my review of that Crucial 8GB kit, which my be helpful to first-timers. Have also been doing the OS X upgrades, usually about 2 - 3 weeks after they were released to see what bugs may have been encountered. Currently the computer is running the OS X 10.9.2 (Mavericks) update, and though I went through some hiccups with the initial OS X 10.9 release, OS X 10.9.2 has been running fine on this computer.Am using the Time Machine backup software application in conjunction with a Seagate Expansion 1TB Portable External USB 3.0 Hard Drive which has been partitioned; one segment is for automatic backups, and the other segment is reserved for manually saving photo, MP3 and video files. The main thing is to let the Time Machine do your backups automatically as a security measure.◆ In Conclusion...I could say more, but the best advice that I can offer is that if you get a MacBook Pro, regardless of which model, take it out of the box, plug it in and charge it.  After that, turn it on and see how easy it can be... the MacBook Pro just works, as you'll see.  Think Different is a reality, and this one proves it.JW ▪ 1/30/2012; Updated 3/10/2014::John Williamson::5.0::January 30, 2012
R21IAPUYZ0FXQG::Switching to OS X from Windows 7 ?::Please note that this is a review for the February 2011 model but I am posting it here since the configuration is almost the same. (also because more people could read this before buying a MBP)I have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought a MBP in May 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.I previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.Before reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --**OS XSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. In OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar (if the application was minimized). I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.After some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key)  to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose  to change the active application window.  It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use one of the function key buttons instead of using the four fingers but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.Please do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you used CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a second excel workbook, you have to bring up the application first and only then switch to the second workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.-->UPDATE We can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while.Switching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key to see all active windows.Taskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting "Combine only when taskbar is full" in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.Also, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13" MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.Again, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.Full Screen - I am addicted to see everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.Microsoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using Ctrl+Scroll Up(on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.Quick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows  7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W.Delete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut.Cut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.Preview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow, I learned this recently. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.Software Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the file into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.VPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .External Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool could not be installed on OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.Bootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.Wakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspectOS X Lion - I am still on Snow Leopard and do not see any reason to upgrade to Lion. In fact I observe that a lot of people want to downgrade to Snow Leopard from Lion due to stability issues. The fixes are on their way but do check for performance before the upgrade.**HARDWARETrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.Keyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.Heat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.Build - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).Screen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13" MBP.Ports - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.DVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.Battery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.Power Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's  power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).Function Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.Webcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.Backlit Keyboard - If you have not used one before you will love this option.Resale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).Apple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.Cons (the only one)Speakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.So to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.******************************************************************************In conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the boat to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7. I am going to still try to adapt to Office 2011 in OS X and if that does not work out I would consider the other Ultrabooks.I would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome.Alternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in most of the cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Currently, HP Envy Spectre 14 has got the best reviews of all the ultrabooks as of now and Asus is about to release their second iteration of zenbooks soon, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan.::R.

RX19W7RDAT5PW::Review from a long time windows user - Excellent Notebook::First of all, I am a systems engineer doing systems development for the past 15 years or more. I have used the very first versions of windows until windows 7. I have used all kinds of other operating systems like Android, Linux, Unix, Ubuntu etc etc.This is my first Mac and I am very impressed with my 2 days of of usage so far. Getting used to trackpad and gestures took a while but I think I am comfortable now.I upgraded RAM to 8GB (bought Crucial sticks from Amazon). Removing back cover needs some mastery of tools but when I removed the factory RAM and installed new sticks, they were recognized instantly and the macbook became even faster. If you are a normal email/simple app user, there is absolutely no need to upgrade memory. 4GB of memory is more than enough for this OS.I could configure VPN in minutes (compared to hours on a windows PC) and it works right out of the box. There is no unnecessary software that came with this Mac and no need to uninstall anything. No virus issues as well. Everything simply works. No crashes or freezes so far.I am an avid Google chrome user but when I saw how fast the Safari browser is, I didn't even think of installing Chrome on this.When the screen backlight is set to 50%, battery lasts for about 7.5 hrs with light usage. Video/Youtube etc strains the battery a bit more.Hardware is a work of art and there are no complaints about it. Looks and feels beautiful and very sturdy.I expect to use this notebook for at least 5 years if not more.If you are also a windows user and thinking of moving to Mac, just don't think. Do the plunge and you won't repent. I gaurantee it.Thanks,Sam.::SamTheTechy::5.0::January 8, 2012
R1DV9HR8DMFHIY::Quality Product::I have been a Pc user for all my life. I am an art major and I needed something that runs reliably with some of the heavy software that I would be using. I had used a iMac at school to finish up a a project with Photoshop (this was a public computer) and it worked amazingly. The first thing I noticed was the fact that there is only one clicking button, not the left and right click that you would see on a PC. The stability of the OS X 10.7.2 is amazing. I have never used such a quick computer before. The computer comes beautifully packaged and the shape of the laptop is just remarkable. I don't know how they were able to fit such a fine mechanism into such a drastically aesthetic design. It's like Apple thought carefully about ease of use, neutrality in color, while also being fully aware of the software. The finger swipes are addictive. You CANNOT do anyhing like this on a PC that I know of. The trackpad is revolutionary in my mind. It is just one solid gray square made of glass. It feels your fingers swipes and seemlessly manages to switch from window to window, screen to screen. The camera is high quality. There is no random, no-name software in here either. This is one of the main things that really almost brought be to tears. I didn't have to uninstall all the useless junkware. The computer turns on, welcomes you, and prompts a few start up questions. Then you have the desktop. I don't, in any way feel pretentious about having this computer. This IS a very expensive computer, but I know that it is a high quality computer, well worth the price. I spend very little time on forums, trying to figure out how to use it. I don't have to call up the geeks to do the things I want, which is nice. In the long run, I may end up spending less money on repairs. I am fotunate that this device is within my grasp, but the truth is, if I couldn't dish out this kind of money, I would have had to settle for a PC.::Abraham Jeyakumar::5.0::December 15, 2011
RNABM42419DMP::Value for money::Mac Book Pro 13 (early 2011 and late 2011) are excellent laptops. It works really well. The pricing is very competitive. You will fall in love with it in no time. If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro.I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk. I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times. So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.Issues I have encountered so far on the Late 2011 Edition (new one):Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background. So, I took it back to the apple store and they  narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is. I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer. Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed. I will be patient for few months.Overall,at this point I feel for 100 bucks more you will get a newer hardware but it is not drastically different and you will not miss anything if you want to save some money and want to stick with the Early 2011 edition.Enjoy your mac book pro !!::my_2_cents::4.0::October 31, 2011
RBBLVM3BLZYUN::Apple vs PC::I purchased this computer for my wife about a year ago.  From the moment we turned it on we noticed the true difference between a PC and a MAC.  PC's are truly built for the Techy and MAC's for the rest of us.  That is not to say that MAC's are only for people that have no idea how to use a PC, they are built for those that don't know how all the code works.  Currently, we have two PC's and one MAC.  The Mac cost quite a bit more than the PC, however, we haven't had any software or hardware problems with the MAC and a host of software problems with the PC.  Furthermore, the touch pad on a MAC is superior to that on a PC.  There is no struggle to scroll down, right click, drag and drop and so on.  Also, when I purchased the MAC, it came with a free wireless printer.  The PC desktop wouldn't load the printer through the Windows auto feature because it couldn't find a suitable driver.  I had to use the disk that came with the Printer.  Not a problem, but when I started loading the software on the PC I figured I would see how it worked on a MAC.  The MAC asked me two easy questions, asked for permission to go to the HP website for the software and printed it's first test page before the PC loaded three of nine items from the disk.Overall, the MAC is superior in everything so far over the PC, but most importantly is the Operating system.  MAC's operating system seems flawless.  Quick start up and blazing speeds to include shut down or waking the system up.  Plus Apple thinks of little details, like a keyboard that knows it's dark so it lights up and then allows you to set the brightness.  You will pay more, but I think money is less important than time and the extra bucks are worth the savings in patience you will need with a PC and Windows.  However, if you are truly looking for that ability to figure out code and love to wait for Windows to consistently update and crash, save some cash and buy a PC.  You can tuck away the savings you will eventually need for relaxation therapy sessions after purchasing a PC.::Ammo13::5.0::February 1, 2012
RTL4SIRAVJLQ1::Great Laptop::This Laptop is just amazing! It is very portable and durable. But, as with most products, there has to be some cons. The display has a glossy finish and dust and other things stick to it. Because of that, you need to wipe off the screen often. Another con, is that if you use this computer while it's charging, it will start to "shock" you. It will be quite annoying, but it stops once you pull out the charger from the computer. Overall this computer is great if you know how to use it, and if you're careful with it.PROS:1- Great Keyboard2-Looks Awesome3-Great Battery Life4-Nice sound Quality5- VERY FASTCONS:1- Computer shocks you when it's charging (and in use at the same time)2-Sticky display3- Screen is very vulnerable to scratches4-Keys can pop off easily::Zurez "ZAMZUREZ"::4.0::January 5, 2012
R3BTC5Q0CB055O::Great computer at a great price!::Apple has once again outdone themselves with a superior product!I replaced my late model 2007 white MacBook with this late 2011 model MacBook Pro and I couldn't be more pleased! It is a beautiful design, runs really fast and is very quiet. Has great RAM and the hard drive space is perfect for a laptop. I work often with the Adobe Suite and it handles it with ease.Set up was super easy (as is all Apple products).Love the backlit keyboard. If I'm working in the dark, it's nice to know where my keys are. I suggest you get a silicone keyboard protector for your keys so they don't wear down and stay like new. You can still see the light shining through even with the silicone keyboard over the keys.Love the Lion OS!Perfect for a beginner, novice, or professional!::Patti Mcclure "Blondiebluetx64"::5.0::December 10, 2011
R2N356NXZRTWW4::Macbook Pro::Okay, I'm the first to admit that I'm not a computer person. I barely know anything about technology-only that I need it to survive. I had a Macbook for a couple of years that I bought from a friend and needed an upgrade. As this was the cheapest option available, I figured I'd go for it.And I'm so glad I did. It is incredibly user friendly. At the setup it asked if I had another Mac I wanted to use to load documents, etc, from and it gave me an option for methods of doing so. I ended up using my external hard drive for it. The computer remembered everything the way I had it on my other system-right down to the last detail. Setting it up took almost no time. I got the 500gb with 4gb of RAM and it runs so well. I am going to be upgrading it to 8g just because I want it to be even faster but from what I can tell it doesn't need it.The picture quality is incredible, I love that the keyboard is backlit, and the touchpad is so streamlined it actually makes it easier to use. I highly recommend this product whether you are a first time Mac user or a Mac lover from way back in the day. You won't be disappointed.*Note* I bought this product on Black Friday and received it two days ahead of schedule. Good job, Amazon. Excellent work.::Jennifer J.

R1G3GZLCK47HZB::Love it!!::As a previous Windows user (11+ years), I was a little skeptical switching to Mac. However, due to my new career in photography, this was a must! I'm so highly impressed with this computer -- automatic updates, no pop-ups, no virus problems, and I don't have to wait an hour to restart the system! It was a little difficult for me to fork out the extra cash, but I'm so glad I did! No regrets whatsoever--I'm totally sold on Mac!::Bethany D.::5.0::January 22, 2012
R1FOUJNNIX9DBL::1st time Mac owner::I've never owned a Mac before. I always had a hard time justifying the difference in price between a MacBook and HP Laptop. But after going through 3 hp laptops (because of viruses), and seeing my brother use his same MacBook Pro without ever having any problems I decided to give it a go. I CANNOT express how happy I am to be a Mac user now. It is head and shoulders about HP/Windows. I can't believe I used to be so negative about these guys. I would make my decision over and over if given the chance, and I recommend anyone that is in a position to afford a Mac, BUY IT! It's the difference between owning a Zune and an iPod. You can't compete with Apple.::Screezy::5.0::January 20, 2012
R2OJ6X75NN4ZUP::A great Apple computer!::I bought this MacBook Pro 13.3' Laptop computer because I wanted a lightweight, smaller computer to use in our living room.  Thinking the smaller screen might present a problem seeing it well, I was surprised that the glossy screen could be seen easily.  Such vivid colors, too!  I am a senior citizen, and have not had any trouble reading what is on the screen.  While I watch TV, I can check my e-mails and answer them, surf the net and check various files that I have.  I also like to play games.  I can also listen to music (CDs or online) and streaming radio broadcasts (our son broadcasts from out-of-state and love being able to hear his radio station's streaming).  Being a Mac-only user, I wanted a very good, well-made, reliable computer with plenty of functions such as a DVD player---and this is it!  And, it only weighs 4.5 lbs., so is easy to place onto a table that I have near my chair when I am finished using it.  It is a great size for travel, too.  I own a larger, older Mac Book Pro, too, and have never been disappointed with it.  I highly recommend this computer.::Loleta S. "peanut butter cookie lover"::5.0::December 11, 2011
R3T7A3FHM376S1::Beautiful, sleek and powerful.::From the moment you open the 'briefcase' style box, layered with a felt like material, you know you have a product of sheer quality, and this is certainly not a misconception.before i got my macbook, i was a committed Windows user, and now i couldn't begin to think of going back to Windows full time. everything about the mac book seems much more logical and intuitive.People are often put off by having to learn another operating system, however the mac is so cleverly designed that from the moment you turn it on you know what to do.. you can explore the computer yourself and the whole time small messages will pop up helping you along the way, and you will look back to how you learnt it and only remember it being simple.you can spent 600 pounds on a good PC and in about 4 years it will feel prehistoric and incredibly slow, the macbook does not have this problem, mine has never dipped in speed once and still impresses me on every use.If the laptop has one fault it is that it gets quite hot, probably due to the metal casing, but this is not a significant problem.I would recommend this to anyone, and if you look around you in this day and age, you can see an 'Apple revolution' is upon us, so maybe now is the time to switch.::Harry Heslop::5.0::April 24, 2012
R3GSGPGAQPNGGO::Amazing.::I switched to the 13" MacBook Pro from a 15" Toshiba Satellite. My Toshiba was only 15 months old but it seemed a lot older - it was very loud (fans and other noises), very heavy, and very fragile. I purchased the refurbished MacBook straight from Apple and it came to my door 2 days later in NEW condition. Start ups are faster, the shortcuts are amazing, the customization (and ease of customization) is amazing. The learning curve is present, but give yourself a week with Mac OS X and you'll forget Windows even exists.There really is nothing bad to say about the machine but I do have one complaint and it's not really about the computer itself, its about iWork. I downloaded the free trials of iWork and Microsoft Office to test out the compatibility of iWork to Office and I was less than impressed. Pages documents would translate to Word and sometimes do funky things with my formatting.All in all I give this machine a 10 out of 10. I am a grad student and use the MacBook mainly for school (papers, research, email, and the like). I will probably never go back to Windows. I encourage you to at least head to BestBuy or an Apple store and try this amazing machine out.One more thing. I would recommend just buying the base 4GB memory version and then upgrading the RAM later on your own. I upgraded my MacBook to 8GB of RAM with the Crucial kit that I purchased through Amazon. It literally took 7 minutes to install. Super easy and it only cost about $45 (compared to Apples (I think) $200 upgrade option).::jcooley3::5.0::March 8, 2012
R2HD9YPAFUXERY::New to Mac, Not going Back.::After a few years of hesitation I finally "drank the kool-aid" and bought my first Apple computer, the MacBook Pro 13 in.  The biggest reason I put this purchase off is not because of the Apple products themselves, I truly didn't think I was good/smart/worthy enough of a Mac.  My fears were put to rest with the delivery of my MacBook this week.  Though it does take some getting used to, the startup-walk through and tutorial was very helpful and Apple was gentle with me.  It's actually more compatible with my non-Mac using cohorts and business stuff than I expected.This is truly one of the most positive  experiences I've had with a new computer purchase.  The performance is still amazing to me: quick, simple, direct and minimal fluff and fanfare (which takes up valuable space).  The swag is does offer is useful and also user friendly.If you are quasi-savvy with computer technology and have been debating on leaving the dark side, I recommend making the change.  You deserve it.::Brian and Monica::5.0::February 14, 2012
R28RFD783DS5GE::Slowly falling in love.......::Having received an iPad 2 for my birthday in September, and feeling that the world was going to end if I didn't update my 3 year old Windows laptop, I decided to give the Mac a try. I am definitely not tech savvy but can pick up things fairly quickly despite my advancing years, however I have to say that initially I had my reservations and seriously felt I had made a mistake. I stuck with it however and have gradually come to enjoy the machine.The most outstanding feature in my mind is the Trackpad that everyone pretty much swoons about. It is amazing. When one gets used to the gestures and ability to click anywhere on the pad with either one finger or two, it just comes to life. Having more money, or rather, more credit, than sense, I married the Mac to both the Apple BT keyboard and trackpad, which makes my office setup both ergonomic and fun.I am still plodding away learning Lion OS which is a departure from Windows 7 and I have to say I do not find it that intuitive, however it is slowly making more sense to me.I decided to upgrade my RAM which, according to Crucial Memory, the Pro will in fact support 16GB as opposed to the 8GB proclaimed by Apple and look forward to installing it today and seeing whether it speeds up my machine. I have to say I am not a heavy multi-tasker with computers or life in general, but it will be interesting to see any changes.Another small frustration in getting to know the mac, and an indicator to my poor pre purchase research, is that some software designed for the mac is different that it's Windows counterparts. Not a huge thing however I enjoyed some aspects of Quicken for Windows not available on the mac version. Hence the wallet opened again and after installing Parallels for Mac and a new copy of Windows 7, I now have the ability to run Windows products seamlessly with my Mac OS all the while continuing to delight in the benefits of the touchpad on the Mac giving me the best of both worlds.All in all I am very happy with the machine and do not regret the purchase. Speed wise it seems good enough for all that I need as I am not a gamer, huge multi-tasker or graphic heavy user. The experience does continue and whereas I was very happy with Windows 7 and Microsoft in general, I am starting to lean more towards Apple. Only time will tell.......Small addendum:Upon upgrading the RAM two things came to light as suggestions. Firstly, invest in a correctly sized mini "phillips style" screwdriver with a good sized handle. The 10 or so screws are fairly securely fastened requiring a moderate amount of torque to get them going. A slightly larger than optimum screw head could easily strip the screw making removal of the back plate a major bug bear.Secondly, if you are, like me, upgrading to different capacity memory sticks, put the larger of the banks in the bottom memory bay. I initially installed my new 8GB module in the top bay, leaving the original 2GB module in the bottom bay. Unfortunately the Mac did not recognize the new module and maintained the original 2GB, 2GB configuration. After a brief review of the Crucial website, I found the suggestion to try and reverse the order of the modules which I did resulting in the Mac recognizing all 10GB when "About this Mac" was consulted.::Derek M.

R2OJW1BWPBA6PM::Yes, a Thousand Times, YES!::I originally hesitated when buying this product.  I am a traveler and I only spend one year in each country before traveling onto the next adventure.  Having something considered "elitist" and very expensive on travels made me a bit nervous of pick pocketing.  Not only that, but it's hard to synch a Mac with other computers and there's no real tech support yet where I'm going next.  So, I ended up buying a different brand of laptop (to remain unnamed) and HATED it.  In it's defense, I think it was a defective model, but still!  So awful and the internet was so slow.  It was pricey too.  Not as pricey as this, but pretty up there.And then I got this... this demigod.Travelers out there, let me tell you, this is the ultimate laptop.  It's skinny, fits well in my backpack, it's lightweight, has a decent battery life (not the best, but certainly decent enough - around 5 hours).  I have the 13".  I know that the Macbook Air is smaller, but it only has 3 hours of battery life, so I opted for this one.  And it's STRONG.  I'm not as worried about it getting broken or damaged because it feels very secure.  (Still... be gentle with it!) I mean, it really is THE ultimate traveling laptop.  There's no getting around it.From the moment I got this awesome device, I could FEEL the difference from the other laptop.  Apple is just on a whole different level.  They keys feel wonderful and the trackpad is easy.  (I still have the wireless mouse, just in case, but I never use it).And any gamers?  I play World of Warcraft and the images are GORGEOUS.  Not to mention there's never any lag.  On the other laptop I briefly had, the lag was awful, and I've experienced lag on my brother's laptop as well.  But on this one?  Never.  It's smooth, uploads quickly and you'll be playing within the hour.  Amazing.All in all, I know it's pricey.  It really is, but it is SO worth it.  The other laptop I had was around 900$.  For 300$ more, this laptop feels like a steal.  They could sell this for 3000$ and get people to buy it.  It really is the next generation.::Julia Norton::5.0::March 25, 2012
R5ENEHZCDHL6N::Amazing laptop::This is my first computer, which I got for college, although I have plenty of experience with using other people's Macs and PCs. One of the reasons I chose a Mac over another PC laptop is the Find My Mac feature with iCloud, so if I ever lose it I can pinpoint it on a Map.I am very happy with it. It's light, it looks great (and great attention to detail), it's super fast, and I love using Lion. In all fairness, I got a customized version with an SSD instead of the default HDD, but with that I can go from cold boot to coding in Dreamweaver in under 20 seconds, which I think is amazing.Trackpad is nice and large, works well with gestures. I had to change some point-and-click preferences however to get it working the way I wanted.I also run Windows 7 (and now, Windows 8) virtual machines with VMware Fusion and Parallels, with an external 1080p monitor, and it can give Windows full graphics acceleration, which I find impressive.One last thing that I love about this is the battery life: I can go over 10 hours on this thing, provided I'm not watching videos or gaming and that I don't have the screen at full brightness.It's not a *perfect* laptop however. I personally am not a fan of the glossy screen. It sometimes reflects lights, and if I touch it, I get a finger print on it, and that doesn't look good until I clean it off.::AJ::5.0::March 19, 2012

The best keyboard I have ever had on a laptop.  I've wanted to make the switch to Mac for several years.  (Always had a fondness for Apple ever since I had a Apple IIc.)  But the price always kept me on Windows.  Back in December, I finally made the switch and I am so glad I did.  I really see why people who have Macs love them.  It is worth making the move.::scribler::5.0::January 22, 2012

The worst thing I had with this is the tracking pad , it stucked and stop responded just the week after. I had to return it back.::Hashim::2.0::May 10, 2012
RDIDON8YEKEYZ::UPDATE: My 1st Mac Was a Lemon.::UPDATE: The first MacBook Pro they sent was apparently a lemon. I took it to my school's tech department and they couldn't find anything that tested bad but they said the computer just wasn't working right and was running way too slow. Plus there was an intermittent issue with the battery not showing a charge. They encouraged me to ask Amazon for an exchange. Amazon agreed to send me an exchange for free and even refunded my Office download that got wasted. Anyways, the second MacBook Pro they sent me is working much better and so far hasn't bogged down like the last one would do all the time.I would have happily given Mac 5/5 except it is just so slow even after all the updates finished installing compared to my Windows 7 machine with less powerful hardware. There are many design elements of the MacBook Pro I like from the laptop itself to the software. But once again, it's just so slow compared to Windows 7 (at least in my experience, I am expecting this review to get flamed by hardcore Mac users regardless). It seems like I spend a third of my time looking at that little colored pinwheel, which seems especially bad since I have the i7 processor. Honestly, if the Mac was faster, I would probably use it more than my Windows 7 machine. I'm going to try upgrading it from 4GB to 8GB RAM soon to see if that helps. I want to like the Mac so bad, but when my Windows 7 computer does most activities literally 2-3 times faster... Anyways, PLEASE don't leave me comments about how fast your Mac is unless you have tips on how to speed mine up. I am just stating MY experience and not the experience others might have with Mac.::R.

I was going to buy it at Best buy but since it was $50 cheaper on amazon plus free shipping and no tax, I decided to get it on here. We have had this MacBook Pro for over a year now and we haven't had one problem with it. It still works like it did from day one. I love Apple products and will never go back to a PC. Yeah you pay more up front for a MacBook over another laptop with windows, but you aren't having to replace it every 2-3 years. I bet we will have this Pro for 10 years and still not have anything go wrong with it. I highly recommend getting it.::Brad Dougan::5.0::March 10, 2013

Can't say that about windows based laptops I've had.  The only drawback is that there is a small learning curve.The price.  The upfront buy was very expensive compared to a laptop.  But when I consider how long this will last vs a laptop and the lack of problems, it became a easy decision.Will NEVER buy a Windows based laptop again!::coinr::5.0::February 23, 2013
R1SWF7IXP7EA6::Iam in love!::I was debating between the 2012 macbook pro I5 or this older version in I7. i decided to go with the 2011 I7 version because of the processor. With the work i do,video editing, photoshop, n having windows 7 (Parallels) I needed the the highest processor my budget would allow me.I could of went with the 2012 2.9 I7 but it was a little more pricey so i decided on this late 2011 and i don't regret it.Coming from windows pc over 10 years of use, I got tired of buying a new laptop every other year and as much as i baby my laptops, i seem to run them into the ground because of the extensive work i do on them. I believe regular pcs are made to just browse, email and Skype n etc but not made to be power-horses.i owned a hp I5 and this macbook pro runs much fasteri added 16gb ram into this baby and with everything open, photoshop, video editing, multiple windows open and windows 7 open i still have a remaining 6gb running, and no crashing or slowing down. this is a web designer dream computer.i never thought i would go with macs but as they say once you go mac you never go backand the fact you can runs windows on macs makes it more perfect.the only reason why i did not give this 5 stars is because battery life. the battery literally last less than 3 hrs after full charge. im not sure if its because im running so much on it at once, but the battery life is really bad and does not give me 9 hrs as advertised.if you webdesign, use photoshop, video editing n etc def get a macbook pro, you wont regret it!::K::4.0::January 7, 2013
R39DW0FC4YVHK5::Best Mac portable I ever owned::I replaced an aging PowerBook G4 that had some memory problems with this beauty, and it has never once -- not ONE time -- let me down.  I had everything backed up on external drives and copying everything over took about 1% of the time backing it up took on the G4.Late last year I put 16GB in this lil baby and she runs like a Ferrari now.  Not that she didn't run fast before, mind you.  I'm wishing I'd gotten the 750GB drive now, but an external iTunes library and a 2TB network storage drive helps keeps things in perspective.  Even with all of the stuff I have on it, I'm only using 75GB.The only reason I have Windows 7 on here is for graduate coursework. the 16GB helps there, too.::Stan Tackett::5.0::January 4, 2013
RDP6VC9XK3QQT::Such a Great Mac!::I purchased this model in 2012. Yes, you heard me right, 2012. Reason being is that the jump to Ivy Bridge and 1600 Mhz ram does't make that much noticeable difference in everyday usage, but the savings up-front do make sense. I went ahead and slapped 16 gb of memory in this bad boy (yes, it's possible), plus a hybrid HD/SSD and it so fast. I would highly recommend this product. I plan on rolling this for a few years, and I have full confidence that the laptop will deliver. I highly recommend this computer.::Pat::5.0::December 14, 2012

This is a great computer and some of the minor issues from previous operating systems have been improved. The back lighting makes for an amazingly bright screen, and the intuitiveness of the Mac has been enhanced. A great computer. The model I bought was the "old version", which was introduced in Oct. '11, and the only major difference from the newest version, which was introduced a little less than 2 months ago, is the verson of the Intel processor. The operating system, size of the hard drive, and amount of RAM are all the same. Highly recommended.::jolene::5.0::August 3, 2012

I was crossing my fingers that the shape would be good. I was amazed! It was shipped very well in the original box! No scratches, and plastic on the screen! I also called Apple and they said the warranty was effective until May, 2013. So this was a real $128 win, with only a little over 2 months lost in warranty.

R29RFU2BZUZ4XI::Recent migrant to Mac::This is my first true Laptop. I previously used PCs, the last being a 16" sony Vaio. I decided to finally try Mac pro as all my friends were raving about it. I bought the 13" version, as I wanted a light laptop given that my previous one was too heavy to travel with or use outdoors. I also wasn't sure I would like Mac and so I got the cheapest version.I have to say that after a short learning period, I'm really satisfied with the Mac. I can say it's my first true laptop, it's really light and slim. Battery time is amazing about 5-6 hours. Love the touch pad and gestures. It connects better to the internet; faster connection to wifi and less crashes. Much faster connection to VPN networks.It takes time to get used to the finder instead of explorer (I personally prefer explorer were you can see folders easier and cut and paste files easier). Also I would have probably been able to get the top of the line PC with the same money for the cheapest Mac pro, some time it takes a longer for iphoto to work or microsoft office products to start working but once they start they are much more stable than on PC and the lag time is minimal and trivial to me.The 13" screen is adequate for internet browsing, watching videos/photos and writing documents. It is a little small for working on excel / databases. I might consider buying a 15" in the future if they become lighter.In summary, I'm glad I made the switch. Microsoft and PC manufacturers have to step up their game if they want to survive.::Analyzer::5.0::March 7, 2012

I got an iPhone and saw how amazing it was and thought "how good could a mac be too"? So i got a macbook. Thought it was great at first but there was a learning curve so i returned it and bought a top of the line hp laptop. Well...It just wasn't the same. Build quality, smooth os, gestures, no bloatware, mac app store. It all adds up and the when i first got the macbook i didn't realize how amazing the whole package was. So i returned the hp laptop and bought a macbook. AGAIN.I could not be happier. Hands down the best purchase i've ever made and  even having been an objective person and "not getting to close and liking things too much", i can see why people swear by apple. I didn't think i could be so impressed with a piece of technology. Seriously. If you get one and it seems overwhelming, go to youtube. Watch tutorials. Ask around forums.

It's not a great choice if you want to use this for a lot of Photoshop work, but it is large enough to handle the most common computer tasks.I've been using Windows since version 1.0 so I was a bit concerned that I could not do all the wiz-bang things that I was used to doing on a Windows computer. It took a little bit of time, but I so much more enjoy using the Mac OS X Lion than Windows. It slowly grows on you and in the first month or two you learn something new each day. One of the things I didn't expect is that I never use -- or feel the need to use -- a mouse. The multi-touch trackpad is so easy and feature packed that a mouse would be a big step backward.My recommendations to long-time Windows users is to make the switch. I purchased a copy of VMWare Fusion 4 which is a fantastic product that allows you to run "real Windows" on your Mac. The initial price of a MacBook Pro is higher than a Windows computer but you make this up in quality and the Mac offers a better total cost of ownership. If you want a trouble-free computer that is easy to use and just plain "works" buy a MacBook Pro.::Neil::5.0::February 17, 2012
R25E0916KGV9YT::Love my new macbook pro :)::I love this laptop! Seriously best purchase for school and all of my other uses. I would recommend this laptop to everyone, it's the best. I have used a lot of different PC laptops, and they just didn't cut it. I was a VAIO user for a while, and I feel like I wasted so much money after using my new Mac!!::Gypsy::5.0::February 14, 2012
R10VFGVT9BRLR3::love it::When I first purchased this computer, I wanted to shoot myself in the foot afterwards. even though it's the best price that you can find anywhere, I was taking a serious plunge. Now that I have it,there are no regrets. This is a great computer and judging by the high quality durability, its going to last me a while. It's sleek and sexy; I feel like a new person because of this computer! If you haven't already converted to mac, I highly recommend you do! I'd buy this again in a heartbeat :)also if your a student, don't forget to get the microsoft windows for mac::Bri::5.0::February 8, 2012
R2XZCZLV8777TX::My first Mac and I love it::This was my first Mac, and I don't know why it took me so long to get one.  It has changed the way I work, and I don't think I will ever g back to a windows-based system.::Jdove::5.0::January 28, 2012
R3E8WWX62JH8QJ::Love my new computer!::Buying a computer is somewhat like buying a car.  As soon as you receive it there's a newer and better model out on the market.  However, I expect to use and enjoy my computer for as long as I possibly can.  Love it!::M. E. Fleming "cias jewels"::5.0::January 25, 2012
RS3OY0I8B91DU::Mac beats PC::I have never had the interest to play videogames on a computer thats why i think mac works the best for me since it cant really handle all those games to play on a computer. If you like making movies and photo editing mac is the way to go. Best laptop i have ever had in my life now i have a 15inch MacBook Pro and a 13inch MacBook Pro.::Omar95::5.0::January 24, 2012
R3XXBVPUM1VIC::Love my MacBook::I am a previous MacBook owner and have always loved Apple products. The updated October 2011 MacBook Pro is definitely a keeper. I am impressed with the Lion software and really enjoy it's features. I am a college student, and I find my MacBook to be very suitable for helping me with my coursework. With the lightweight design and sick computing capabilities, this computer is surly  worth the money!::tyler::5.0::January 23, 2012
R26KHBQFD84I2O::Excellent, so glad I bought it::I switched from a windows computer to this Macbook Pro and love it. It has a learning curve as it is very different from the windows operating system, but there are good tutorials to help.  The quality of the machine is leaps and bounds over any computer I have ever bought. Some of the software is not so great...like I Bank, But most of my favoriteprograms I can use on the Mac.  Fast processor and user friendly set up.::Marilyn A. Cook::5.0::January 23, 2012
R3SFV5BADUSB3A::Happy Mac camper::I wish I had enough time to write the long, detailed review I want to write. It will have to be enough to say that I am more than happy with my Macbook Pro. I had used Windows based laptops and notebooks (Toshiba, Acer) for the last 5 years and I can't see myself going back for anything. This computer is FAST. It is stylish. It's not cheap, but it's durable. When you think of the fact that the first graphing calculators were as expensive as a MacBook Pro (and that during a time when money was worth a lot more) it's not hard to believe that this is worth it.I play COD 4: Modern Warfare and Batman Arkham Asylum on it daily with no glitches or slowdowns. There are Mac versions of all my favorite PC applications (like Skype and Firefox - though I prefer Safari to Firefox) and not surprisingly iTunes WORKS on this machine where it failed on my low RAM Windows PC.I have not been dissapointed with my purchase in the SLIGHTEST. I'm glad I ordered from Amazon and saved myself $100.::Terminator X::5.0::January 5, 2012
RGLZH2RTK9S66::MacBook Pro::A typically stylish and easy to set up Apple product. It's light and the screen resolution is good. I wish the software came on disks as well as pre-loaded though.::Marcia Kaplan::4.0::December 30, 2011
R308604WLOANPO::From PC to Mac.. never go back!::This laptop is amazing. The resolution is incredible. It is fast and easy to use. All my life I was a PC user and it was not hard at all to change to this new system.::Isabignon::5.0::December 29, 2011
RG3QT26VCTX5D::Expensive, but well worth it.::I saved up my money for months to buy this laptop to use for both school and leisure. Having done so, I can attest that it is worth every penny. Everything about it runs quickly and with great ease, and it's workmanship feels so intuitive. Setup was a breeze, and this is coming from someone who knows absolutely nothing about computers - my ignorance of computers and desire for one that would be easy to use is one of the reasons I bought this in the first place! As far as I'm concerned the money was well spent, and I can't foresee not continuing to feel that way for years to come.::Jordan::5.0::December 26, 2011

Marino::5.0::December 25, 2011
R39Q2BPYHFDL51::Great and awesome!!!::I love everything about this MacBook Pro.  The 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 is fast to me!  I upgraded to 8 GB of RAM, which I completely recommend and it's very cheap).  It's portable enough to take from office to home and travel; it's slim and light.  It's powerful and even more powerful than my current desktop (a fairly new Macbook) and the batter life is wonderful!  While I could use a bigger screen when I'm working on multiple documents, I compromised space for portability and I don't regret it.  The Thunderbolt works great with the HDMI adapter (just remember to change the sound settings in System Preferences and choose your TV as your sound output device).  Though it works great, before the first year is up, I plan to purchase Apple Care to extend the warranty two more years...you never know and I've been very happy with Apple Care for previous computers.  I didn't purchase it right away to save a little money upfront.::Lucky Ducky::5.0::December 23, 2011
R3P74MQZLEC0HD::MacBook Pro is the laptop to get. No question.....::After spending most of my adult life messing with PCs and working in the industry, I always wondered how the Macs compared to the PC.  Recently, the iPhone came to Sprint and I was able to acquire the iPhone 4S after all these years waiting patiently and buying android phones.  The iPhone hooked me.  After seeing how great the phone was, my curiosity was at an all time high for the MacBook.  I made the plunge via store.apple.com.I thought there would be a massive learning curve going in but to my surprise, everything is simple and straight forward. Things that I thought I would struggle with like finding out the computer name, networking, connecting to a printer, divx codecs, and installing software were all straight forward.  It just works.The hardware is a work of art.  Backlit keyboard is amazing.  My old windows laptop had a light flash down on the keyboard but this is so much better and easy on the eyes.  From a looks standpoint, this blows away everything else excluding the MacBook Air.  Windows just feels old.  PCs feel prehistoric and very dated.At this point, I don't see myself buying or building another PC/laptop.  The only thing I haven't figured out at this point is why I waited so long?::Lotto::5.0::December 22, 2011
R32T81T8V07YHZ::Fantastic Machine at a fairly reasonable price....::When I was researching this product in while in the process of trying to find a new laptop, the word "intuitive" seemed to be bandied about by both Apple and its acolytes.  After my purchase I am happy to report that intuitive is not merely a buzzword but a fantastic adjective to describe this wonderful machine!  The trackpad is nothing short of amazing and will certainly ruin any other impostor you might be familiar with using (my old Dell's feels terrible by comparison).  The entire package is wonderful and the backlit screen and keyboard is a welcome feature that you will certainly enjoy.  I could go on and on about why I am incredibly satisfied, but I'll just stop by saying that if you are willing to pay roughly $1,000 on a laptop that will probably last you the better part of a decade you cannot do better than the Macbook Pro!::Nick::5.0::December 18, 2011
R19KSM7ZPOLT5T::Love the computer::Got this macbook after using Toshiba. What a difference!!Very convenient to use and has excellent processing speed. I love that it doesn't get heated even after extensive usage. Recommend it for others to try.::P. Singh "rutgers geek"::5.0::December 15, 2011
R27RZWQ7NK452Z::At last, my true love has come along...::After doing graphic design work on PC's for over a decade I took the plunge to Mac.  Why the hell did I wait so long?!? I have only had my MacBook for about 40 hours, and had no previous Mac experience, and things are becoming pretty familiar already.  If you are concerned about switching operating systems, don't be.My last laptop was a Gateway and for the last year I have had an issue with the power supply.  I would spend as much time wiggling the damn power cord as I did actually working.  The Mac is well designed and shows a lot of attention to detail.  Form follows function so to speak.  So I really took notice while looking at something as small as the design of the magsafe adapter and power cord.  If Apple put that much thought into the cord (while most manufacturers treat that stuff as an after thought) then I have to believe that the really important aspects of the machine were in good hands as well.I also ordered a mini HDMI cable so I could plug into my flat screen TV.  So tonight I'm sitting in my recliner in the living room doing graphic design work on the big screen while running netflix on the laptop screen along with my email and about 4 other programs.  The MacBook didn't even break a sweat.Being a screen printer I was used to using CorelDraw for design work and was hesitant to switch to Mac since Corel isn't available in a Mac version.  No problems, I was able to set up a virtual windows machine using Parallels for Mac and can now run any windows program as well.  Sharing files between photoshop on Mac and Corel on windows was also very easy.This machine is a bad ass!Nothing wrong with pc's I will still be using one at work but if you are considering getting a Mac...Jump on in the water is fine.::Menu Guy::5.0::May 28, 2012
RU0MDRUFKEN3J::Windows just doesn't compare::I've been using Macintosh computers since 1996, and in 2011 I decided maybe it was time to get with the "Windows world" and purchase a PC. As you can probably assume by this review, I did not hold on to that PC too long. I decided to go back to Mac with the brand new MacBook Pro--and words cannot explain how much BETTER Apple's OSX operating is to Windows 7.I can honestly say, I'm a better person with my MacBook Pro. I'd be willing to bet that any Windows user who buys one of these laptops will NEVER voluntarily go back to using a PC ever again.Everything is incredibly simple, the screen is gorgeous, the keyboard has quiet-touch keys that light up which make typing fun. Start up time is incredibly fast. I'd say it takes less than 40 seconds from me pressing the power key to being on the internet.iPhones, iPods, wireless printers, etc., all hook up with ease with this computer. Heck, I even love the sound it makes when it closes.So no, this is not me being an Apple "fanboy" as they call it. I've worked with Mac's for over 15 years, have an iPhone, and now this, but it's just me simply recognizing that Apple's products are SUPERIOR to Microsoft's.Those commercials of "go Mac and you'll never go back" are 100% true. I could not have put my money towards a better piece of equipment.::matt1229::5.0::May 16, 2012
RDQN9R3DVBVLB::Insanely great!::I have the 500GB/2.4GHz Core i5 version. The hardware quality alone makes it worth the price, and MAC OS X Lion adds another layer of excellence.As others have said, the attention to detail in the hardware is superb, most notably the aluminium unibody chassis, the vivid LCD screen (1280 x 800), the panel hinge and the unsurpassed trackpad. The baseline Macbook Pro represented here is a beautifully engineered embodiment of the Intel Sandy Bridge mobile platform with integrated HD 3000 graphics.I have a few minor negatives to share, but nothing that would warrant docking a star from the rating:1) You won't be getting iWeb or iDVD as part of the iLife package pre-installed with the machine. You still get iMovie and Garageband, though.2) 4GB of memory is on the edge of being too little, depending on how many applications you are apt to leave open during a working day. You may be glad that it is easy to upgrade the RAM on this machine to 8GB.3) The integrated graphics are weaker than the previously supported nVidia discrete graphics in the Core 2 Duo MacBooks. You now have to step up to the 15" Macbooks to get a machine suitable for graphics-intensive tasks (other than video encoding and playback). But, unless you use your machine for gaming or 3-d animations you are unlikely to miss the graphics prowess of a discrete GPU.These days Windows has gained much of the stability and usability that used to be the sole province of Mac OS, so the preference for Mac OS is less compelling than it once was. Nevertheless, the use of a large, ergonomic trackpad with reliable and accurate gesture recognition *built into the OS* is a wonderful thing, and not easy to give up once you've experienced it. Windows 8 may take that distinction away as well, but so far I've not come across PC hardware good enough to make the experience as complete as it is with currently is with a late 2011 Macbook.::C.

R3FCDLS1NKFBWN::Best Laptop I have ever had::I just received the laptop today and have not been able to shut it off!! I researched a lot of different computers, I wanted something for everyday, I don't use it for work just personal stuff.Right out of the box was ready to go, awesome is all I can say! I can't even hear it run. I noticed in the reviews different people complained about fan noise, I have not even heard the fan.Switching from windows to mac is a huge change, but you catch on real quick.1st day, not a lot of time on it yet but it's awesome!I wouldn't hesitate ordering this computer, you won't be sorry, and fast, unbelievably fast!!Love it!::Cindy::5.0::December 2, 2011
R1Z7IETD5KV1DI::Fast, great design.::Just purchased the newest MacBook Pro 13". This has the 500GB hard drive and I've replaced the stock ram with Crucial 8 GB. I also have a Mac Mini and was able to download all my apps and get up and running in no time. This size (13") is the ideal size vs weight for my needs. Everything about the design is well thought out. I am stunned at the quality of the power adaptor (Mag Safe), the backlit keys, the trackpad (pinch to zoom), and the outer shell are all top notch and well executed.At $1139, these are a great machine for the money.::Cylon Lover "P"::5.0::November 5, 2011
RCGSI0RS846NA::Love the product::Bought it July 2011 and still on love with it. got 1 issue during the early adoption of OS-Lion but Apple Care were able to rebuild it the machine for me, after that it went so smoothly.Few items from heavily user:- Battery will need to be flushed every month for better performance.- The machine from time to time get warm due to a third party software that was eating the CPU cycles.- Recommend to get external disk and take frequent backup using the Time machine.My next laptop will be new Macbook for sure.::Amr Abdelhalem "Amr Halem"::5.0::November 14, 2011
R2FT68G6RYR4WK::Over rated in my opinion::In my opinion this laptop is kind of over-rate. Let me first state that I had a lot of expectation from a Mac not because there is something wrong with me, but because Apple has through its advertisement made it look like the best laptop out there. If I have to sum this laptop in one word, I would say "track pad". Nothing else on this laptop is exceptional. The uni body is good but you will find yourself protecting the scratch prone body more than enjoying it.Also, I want to make it clear that I am not an Apple hater, although I don't see why it should be a problem. I own an iPhone 4S and an iPad 2 and I am totally enjoying them.I will list the pros and cons.Pros:Looks good.Track pad is the best out there.Cons:Fan makes noise.The bottom gets very hot.Hard disk makes the same read-write noises that it makes on other cheap ones.OS is not all that good after all. It is still trying to catch up with Windows in many ways. Windows 7 is a much better OS in my opinion.I think in the end it comes down to the fact that if you spend as much money on a Windows laptop as you do on a MacBook Pro you would never feel the need to shift to a mac and I am going to do just that.At the same time, I will re-consider buying a Mac again when OS X is well groomed and when Macbook gives value for money spent on it. Right now, it behaves like any other laptop in terms on fan noise, heating and does not justify the $1100 point mark.::SAH::3.0::April 5, 2012
R3EBY88BLYJU5M::MacBook Pro::I LOVE my New MacBook Pro. It is taking a little getting used to having come from the PC world. Its a whole new animal altogether. The thing is, I'm getting used to it very quickly, and falling in Love all over again. The way that the Mac is so user friendly and kinda shortcuts most everyday computer operations. Streamlining the whole personal computer process. Not only that, it RUUUNZZ!!! I mean it runs like an Olympic Champ. It is so smooth and so fast regarding all operations. I will NEVER own anything other than a Mac again if I can at all help it.::Eduardo Colón::5.0::December 1, 2011
R2E50AO8XSQKGP::Good initially but then problems - poor support::This concerns a Mac Book Pro that was purchased in late 2009.  Since that time it had required TWO replacements of the track pad; a first in January, 2011, and a second in February, 2012.  In both cases I have paid for the repair (for a total of approximately $98 each time).I am very disappointed in the product as the track pad is used as much or more than any other component and it is reasonable to expect it to last more than the time it did.  I realize that use patterns may differ between people, but the fact that the computer has needed three track pads in less than three years is quite disturbing.Equally disturbing is that Apple never offered to pay for either of the repairs, which I would have expected a company to do if it was really concerned about customer service and satisfaction.  Nor have they responded to my repeated attempts to engage them in a discussion of my situation.We have a second Mac Book Pro in the family - purchased in 2008. It had to have the entire screen and back panel replaced because of a design flaw - a cable that connected an internal board to the display screen had become dislodged and pinched by the opening and closing of the computer. Total cost was over $700, of which Apple paid about 1/2. That was about a year ago. Guess what? The same problem is now recurring.::Anon::2.0::July 8, 2012
R2Q7YDMRQC0JHK::First MacBook Pro::I just ordered my very first MacBook pro today.  My friend gave me the black macbook from late 2006 and it's on it's last legs.  That was my first introduction to OS X and I'm in love. Everything about Apple's OS and their equipment is so elegant and easy to use.  I was a die hard PC user for the past 10 years but now I don't think I will ever go back.  There was always things I wished I could do on my PC but for some reason wasn't allowed or couldn't figure it out.  With OS X, I can do everything that I want and do it relatively easy.  Apple products are very pricey but, you definitely get what you pay for.I decided to go with the 13" MBP because it fit better into my budget and the portability of it.  I wanted a machine that could perform when watching HD videos, doing some light video/photo editing, playing some games every now and again, as well as doing my daily work (word processing, email, web browsing, etc..).  I travel quite a bit and this was definitely the machine that fit me.  I imagine I will eventually add an SSD and upgrade the RAM but, coming from a 6 year old MacBook to this, I'm sure I will be very satisfied.::kevinm041::5.0::April 17, 2012
R3FALFG3NUVUI::Loving the Mac::I had been skeptical of buying a Mac for years, mostly because I felt they were overpriced.  To some extent, I still feel they are a little too pricey, but I can't say enough about how happy I am with the MBP thus far.  I thought it might take a while to get acclimated to the different OS, having used Windows for years.  It has been a pretty easy transition.  OSX is intuitive, snappy and fun to use.  Having an iPhone and syncing with iTunes is so much easier than using iTunes on a Windows machine.I have been using both Vista (awful OS) and Windows 7 (very good OS).  I can't say I miss those days.  I hope the MBP holds up better over time than my previous Windows machines.  In speaking with friends, they notice no significant slowdowns in their MBP even a few years later.  This is my pet peeve with Windows machines.  No matter how well you maintain them, they slow to a crawl...and iTunes becomes unusable.I can't wait until Mountain Lion comes out, and I get to use some of the iOS applications that are optimized for OSX.::nmck31::5.0::February 23, 2012
R1NRSN1FPOTH55::A Magnificent Laptop That's Great at Being a Laptop!::Plain and simple, the 13" MacBook Pro w/ Core i5 processor is excellent at being what it's supposed to be...a laptop!  I spent months researching laptops.  I wanted something full powered (core i5) in a simplistic 13" form factor, with great battery life.  I went back and forth between some of the new 'Ultrabooks' such as the Asus Zenbook & Toshiba Portege.  They were tempting, but a big turn off to me was the limited processing power and shallow feel to the keyboard.  In the end I came down to the Lenovo U400 and this MacBook Pro.  An excellent Black Friday deal got be the U400 for around $850, so I took the plunge.  Without going into details, the end result was a return within a week and my ordering of this fine computer.What really sold me on the MacBook Pro was it's ability to thrive at being a laptop.  I personally do not feel there is a better laptop out there for the reasons in which I will list shortly.  Now I will start off by saying that I am not an Apple fan simple because they're Apple.  Now, that said, here are the reasons that sold me:1.  The simplistic, all aluminum case in a 13" form factor.2.  The keyboard is second to none for laptops.3.  The touch pad is a dream to use.4.  The battery life is top notch for a full featured laptop.5.  It has the little extras such as back lit keyboard and SD reader built in.Notice I did not mention anything about the Mac OS.  Up until I purchased this computer, I had very little experience with the Mac OS, so I was a little hesitant.  I have a fairly technical background and knack for tinkering with my computers, so I figured how hard could it be to learn?  To my surprise, it was a little frustrating the first week or two, but after that all I can say is that it simply makes sense.  Things work in the way that they should work.  Does this create some limitations on what you can do in comparison to a more open Windows? Yes, certainly.  But at the same time, I've learned that I really don't need to do those tiny little things I was fussing over.  Some people will never be fans of Apple or their OS, and that's understandable.  But coming from an avid Windows user and someone a little more technically inclined than the average person, I can honestly say it's a pleasure to use the Mac OS.My only tiny gripe is that Apple still refuses to incorporate HDMI.  I'd love to hook my MacBook Pro up to my external monitor for those times the extra screen real estate could be used.  There are plenty of adapters out there though to make this happen still.  I just wish it didn't take an adapter or special cable.So far so good.  I highly recommend the 13" Core i5 MacBook Pro to anyone looking for a new laptop!::Dale::5.0::February 13, 2012
RYSTRS5LWAA9T::My MacBook Pro: PC At Its Best!!!::First, I'm a long time Windows-Based Computer user. This is my first Apple product ever. I have to admit, up until recently I've considered myself an Anti-Apple Crusader! But in my new job, I've got a lot of exposure to Apple's products and the customers feedback has been overwhelming: People love their Apples!! You combine that with life-long series of disappointments, frustrations, freezes, crashes, viruses and 'updates' with each and every "PC" I have come to own or use ( and trust me when I say: I've got my hands on quite a few).It was a 'Green Monday' deal at a nearby Bestbuy store: Apple MacBook Pro 13" for a little over $1000 with 6-18 months Financing. I just couldn't let it pass. And so I got my hands on my first Mac.Urban Myths Versus First-Hand Realities:-----------------------------------------------1) The Only True PC On The Market: We use the abbreviation PC so loosely that we kind of forgot what it stands for: "Personal Computer." So it has nothing to do with a particular OS or hardware manufacturer but rather the combination of both and the overall user's experience. That's being said, and having used my Macbook for  over two months, I'm ready to make a rather bold statement: Mac computers are the only true PC's on the market. Other machines are more less of Windows-Bloated computers!!2) The Mac OS: Mine has Mac OS X v10.7 Lion pre-installed.  I have to admit I was afraid the switch was going to be hard because I knew nothing about Macs. But 3 days into using my MacBook Pro, I fell in love with it!  The Operating System is very user-friendly and ridiculously easy to use/navigate. The following link was a great reference for me: [...]. I also went on YouTube for more advise on how to get the best of my new Mac. And the Apple Rep at the nearby BestBuy store was super helpful. Honestly, by the end of the first week, I was up & running and since, never really needed to ask any questions as to how use my Mac. Oh, one more thing that is worth highlight: settings ("System Preferences") are very visualized & easy to set up & change. Three thumbs up! I know I'll never miss the "Control Panel" on other so-called PC's.3) Superior Build Quality: You get what you pay for. You're paying premium price but you're also getting a premium quality. The Aluminium unibody is an eye and a hand pleaser! The built quality is superb and attention to details is meticulous!4) Great Juice Pack! The MacBook Pro is, hands down, the best battery life laptop out there with 7 hours of rigorous use easy! I can't think of any other laptop that comes close.5) Lack of HDMI port: Simply overrated! All you need is a Mini Display to HDMI adaptor and you're set! It would be nice to have a dedicated HDMI but I don't think it's a deal breaker.6) Blue Ray Drive: Well, it would be nice to have but I don't miss it. Here's why, because I don't like spending $25 on Blue Ray Discs!!7) ClickPad: Once you learn the different gestures you can do with your fingers on the generously spaced ClickPad, you're hooked for life. It makes browsing the Internet a pleasurable experience. It really is flawless.8) WebCam: is standard VGA 1.3 MP that fell short of expectations, especially when compared to the 2.0 MP WebCam found on laptops like my previous Lenovo Edge 14". I have to admit, the difference in video conferencing quality is noticeable. I am not saying it's bad but I surely have seen better and was hoping for more.9) I love the "Dock." It really is the easiest way to access frequently used apps. When you combine it with the "Launchpad" then all of your apps come within reach. The whole platform is optimized for multitasking.10) The First Comprehensive Digital Ecosystem: Apple-branded devices work in a near perfect harmony with each other: iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, Time Capsule and Apple TV. You've got apps for your MacBook, apps for your iPhone, your iPad. You've got all kinds of accessories to personalize & maximize work and play output.

R2475UQX6G2Y9Z::Very good computer.::Very, very good, must people that buy a mac will not repent of doing this. I talked with a friend that work on the informatics sector of office depot, and he told me that the best brands( that most do not have problems) are three: apple, asus and lenovo.He told that, if you can afford, buy apple's products. they have best material than the other one's and will last more.Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)::Lucas Moraes Vieira "lucas"::4.0::January 2, 2012
R1TQKGHMYBY693::Air or Pro 13.3?::Macbook Air----------  More screen (1440x900 v 1280x800)  Sexier, more portable (less weight, thinner)  Better keyboard input (sharp edges on the Pro's frame cut into the wrist over extended periods)Macbook Pro-----------  Better display with wider color gamut and viewing angle (IPS panel v TN)  Rugged (search for faint lines on Air, Air is susceptible to keyboard imprints, Pro's display protected by glass)  CPU is faster with a larger cache (Air is good and more than fast enough for day to day things, so is the iPad)  Cooler and quieter (Air gets noisy on moderate load)  Upgradable SSD or HDD (lottery SSD with Air)  Upgrade to 8GB RAM for cheap  Gigabit LAN  DVD drive is convertible to a 2nd drive or SSDI really wanted to get the Air but the screen was disappointing unless you look at it directly (perpendicular). I would kill for the 1440x900 screen though! And the noise while watching youtube or anything moderately cpu intensive is unbearable on the Air but much more tolerable than a run of the mill PC laptop. I've been spoiled by the unbeatable quality of the Macbook Pro line and when it came time to upgrade I stayed with it. I'm sure an Air is in my future but not yet.::mgutz::5.0::December 29, 2011

R1Q8NG679SE9VI::I love my MacBook Pro::I have to say that I like this old version of the MBP better than the newer ones. The main reasons are that this one is a little thicker, so it doesn't feel flimsy, like the smallest drop could seriously damage it; I like the placement of the USB slots- everything is on one side; and lastly, the superdrive: it's there- on the newer models the superdrive has been removed, so in order to play dvds, which is one of the main reasons that I bought a laptop, you have to spend around $80 to buy an external one.::Ethan Smith::5.0::April 19, 2014

RFQI2VNKLH0GX::Dissapointed with this piece of rubbish::I purchased my Macbook Pro in May 2012 after deliberating on whether to purchase a different brand of laptop after being let down by my Acer laptop. After doing some research and reading reviews I finally decided on the MacBook Pro MD313. My first concern was about the 2 USB ports. With so many devices to connect I thought that these wouldn’t be sufficient for my needs, but then I compromised. I have not had any problems with the machine thus far until about 2 weeks ago. When I connect my devices they disconnect within 5 seconds. I then started having to work on documents on drop box as I couldn’t save anything. After doing research on the internet I find out that there is a possibility that I may need the logic board replaced. I then took the machine to the istore so they could send it to the technicians. The technicians say my USB ports are damaged and since they are attached to the logic board the entire thing needs to be replaced. The cost of replacing it, close to $ 700. That’s almost the price of a new MacBook Pro. To say the least I am disappointed that a machine of this calibre can have problems like this. I have memory sticks which can’t be inserted incorrectly as connectors are only on the top part of the usb stick. I back my laptop up once every 2 months to a sea gate external drive. I can’t believe that a laptop which costs so much can be so useless. I have never had a similar problem with any of my laptops. Here I was thinking I would keep this Mac for the next 5 years as many people has said theirs lasted a long time. I am now stuck with a piece of apple junk that cost me $ 1100. If someone sees me with another apple product they must just shoot me.::Al Kapono::1.0::March 5, 2014

I couldn't be happier, this is the best investment so far, very quick easy to use, almost everything I use to do with Pc's I'm doing it here. I upgraded the memory and it's running as no other PC i ever own, plus I'm using parallels to run some Windows App I need for my studies, so I have the best and I definitely recommend to buy a Mac, you won't regret it :)::luisk23::5.0::October 8, 2013

R2JWC0VI4I7I7F::Could be better.::Could be better.Tired of having to replace my cheap computers and spending all that money for something with poor performance.Over all the MacBook is put together well. The rubber seems stay in place, the power button is flush with unparalleled precision. Doesn't have a cheap feel to it.i5 processor can handle most jobs fairly well. Not powerful enough to play games or do any heavy-duty video processing, but mild video processing is acceptable. Only 2 usb ports which takes some getting used to and it's expensive to replace parts. For example the one I got was used of course so one of the ports doesn't work and the track pad sucks compared to using a mouse. A splitter might solve that problem for you.Also since this is high performance you might want to get a cooling pad to keep your lap from catching fire and some plugs to keep the dust and stuff out of the external ports and holes and such and forts and poles and lunch.::Tom Roberts::4.0::August 27, 2013

Glad I bought it off Amazon and not directly from Apple - better price, no tax, and replacement was a breeze.Not too happy with the Macbook itself - This is my second Mac and not as good as my 1st one. It can't process quickly enough, battery gets drained out quicker (plus the unibody is a pain), and hangs pretty often.Guess Appleis concentrating on advancing technologies for the iphones and iPads...not so much the macbooks.::DarkMystique::3.0::January 18, 2013

The included apps like Garageband and Photobooth are fun to use! The built in camera is cool too.  The beautiful thing about ordering through Amazon (and living in California) is there is no tax!

Once I came across that in my research, getting the much cheaper i5 was a no- brainer.This computer is also a beast.

When I purchased this puter the original owner was able to use a remote access program to reinstall those apps with his Apple ID, so I could use it, but I will not be able to receive future updates.  The Mac App store wouldn't even let me purchase iLife Apps, due to the previous owner already installing those apps for my puters particular s/n.::JeffH::5.0::January 16, 2012
R19N183IWJCPAC::Never going back to pc!!!!::For christmas my boyfriend bought me a Mac pro 13.  After going through several HP computers that keep needing the hard drive replaced about once a year we got tired of spending $700 for crap computers.  While I didn't like spending the money for a Mac you have consider the peace of mind you get.  Having my desktop hacked recently and not being able to turn it on it only drove home the fact that you get what you pay for. I love my Mac it is so easy to use I never have a problem with it no more freezing, losing my stuff or having issues period.  I also got my son an iPad to replace his NetBoot which got hacked as well.  My family is now and forever a apple user.  I'm working on getting a Mac desk top for my business although my Mac book pro works great for my business as well. My only complaint is there is no one note for Mac I depend heavily on it to "print" thing off internet without killing trees and as of yet haven't found a program I like as much. To protect my investment in got a speck matte cover which has already saved my Mac from scratches and silicone keyboard cover which I love. I never considered these items with my pc bc I thought they would give out so fast it wouldn't be worth it. Now that I have a com outer that will last for years it's worth it. When I was researching macs I found people saying there 2006 macs still worked fine they just wanted an updated one. That one statement won me over I haven't had a pc work for more than a year much less since 06 says a lot about apple.

R3B5LJ7TV4BJK9::Best Service.....::Ordering the Macbook pro on Amazon was a good decision. The price was fair or let me say the best on the market. Received it the day it was scheduled to be delivered....Love the service.::keezol::5.0::January 14, 2012
R12077G6ELD1SJ::Look no further::If you're still on the fence about buying a Mac, this is the ideal place to jump off.  It is an exceptional entry point for the Mac experience ... great performance in a comfortable package.  Seamless aluminum case is functional, solid and very cool; display is better than most anything out there; and ... well ... it's a Mac.  Sure, the MacBook Pro may cost twice as much as entry point for PC laptop but that's kind of like comparing a tool to a toy - both appear to work but only one truly gets the job done (unless you happen to be 6 years old, in which case maybe you're okay with a disposable laptop).  The i5 processor is more than adequate for all but the most demanding jobs - my daughter uses this Mac for making videos for high school with acceptable performance.  I'm sure at some point we'll juice-up the memory but for now, it's just fine for routine tasks (surfing, word processing, e-mail and managing media library).  Only wish we had jumped onto the Mac side long ago and avoided years of frustration with PCs.::Water Mark::5.0::January 14, 2012
R27BY2PWEFV3E3::a great laptop::I've used Mac machines - mostly laptops - since 1986. My Macbook purchased in 2006 still works great, but wanted to upgrade and use it as a backup in the event it bites the dust (I live in another country where the environment is harsh and hardware costs more). The Macbook Pro 13.3 inch, now the entry level Apple hard drive laptop, does everything well that I need from multi-lingual word processing, producing songs and movies, photo management to everyday functions like web browsing and listening to audio files. You get more bang for your buck on this unit than on the earlier Macbooks. The Lion OS it runs on is sleek. The only drawback (which probably is ultimately a technological plus) is their cutting Rosetta - unlike earlier operating systems, Lion does not process the older Power PC software, which simply means the cost of software upgrades to more streamlined products. Amazon gave me the best price for the unit and delivered it fast.::tundheim::5.0::January 14, 2012
R1TNYNCKOV7XBM::Bad service::Actually i have been very much happy with the product but its the service that makes me feel am cheatedCouple of months back i had to visit the apple service centre due to some problem in my macbook but they said my serial number is not recognised by appleso they asked me to get the bill now i dont have a bill which has my mbp's serial number printed on it,Amazon am looking for a solution for this hope someoneis listening,Please look for the other buyers people::Harinag pampati::5.0::January 13, 2012

R355OATOZQBKBD::Perfection is just around the corner !!!::I bought this laptop because I wanted a change from my regular windows machines. I had heard about how well Mac is designed , and when it arrived - I got to see it myself.It is a very well designed product. It definitely does not heat up as my windows machine ( I own hp, dell, toshiba... ) . It has a great OS and great built in software ( iSuite ).. Easy to setup, and then begin working on it. It is great for viewing photographs and editing them. It is far superior in color reproduction than any of my other machines - finally some justice done to my photographs. Multitouch and gestures are awsome - windows machines are no way near it. Good sound reproduction - i love it with my bose on... The webcam is much better than competing machines today.Being a machine, I cannot say that it is perfect - it froze on me yesterday. It is still a great effort in inching towards one.::Chirag::5.0::January 4, 2012
R3MS2IHYJSPC2N::Great Computer, ideal for traveling::I got this for my husband who is deployed. It works great and easy to travel with.

R2OCJWFDKDGEI7::Great Little Mac!::This is a great little machine (and back up for my 21" iMac).  The screen is really an amazing thing to see, and the trackpad convinced me to buy the stand-alone track pad for my iMac.  The backlit keyboard is something all machines should have!I'm very pleased with this purchase, and glad I made it on Cyber Monday, when the price was lower.::HJH::5.0::January 2, 2012

This MacBook is powerful, i could have many programs open at the same time and it runs fast, and the battery last longer than i thought..

R4KTQM4TFPPJ9::Excellent::The best laptop I have ever had; I am using computers since 1970 from the IBM mainframes thru Windows PC and then laptop, but got tired of freezing, virus, etc. and decided to change to Mac (now have iPod, iPhone and Macbook Pro). My last one have Win7, 4GbRAM, 320GbHD and everything else for an updated laptop, but soon after I bought it start the same problems; now this is for far a state of the art one, nice looking, very small and lightweight, robust hardware and excellent operating system. I will never change to Windows, it worth the money I paid, I recommend it.::LEPP::5.0::December 19, 2011
R2BRUBHKYE2GGT::super!::I don't know much about computer and I've never used a mac before. My old PC isn't working so I think it's time for a change. I originally wanted the fancier one of the 13 inch model but my budget is tight. So I went with the cheapest pro (the i5 processor with 500 gb HDD). I ordered it on Friday and I selected the next day shipping. I got my new mac in the early morning on Saturday! Good job, amazon! I spent a day playing with it to get familiar with the new os. And I am amazed! It's pretty, high quality, and fast. Highly recommend!::fateornot::5.0::December 18, 2011
R11E67S0DB3K22::Great value for the money::I purchased a "used" ( only 6 months old from org. purchase date) Apple Pro MacBook  13 inch screen..Got some upgrades plus a remaining 2 year Apple care warranty for $1164.00....An co- worker's son is in Apple support...took the computer home and checked it out and said everything looked good and that I got a decent deal. Now, I need to learn how to use it..LOL::TYLER LOFLIN::5.0::December 14, 2011
R1YP0VZ495P4FY::Just what I expected::As with any Macbook Pro, it's shiny and beautiful and it works pretty fast. I used to only use PCs and this is my first personal Apple computer and I love it. Of course, you have to download Adobe yourself and then purchase Microsoft Office and all that jazz. It has yet to disappoint me. It is not too heavy compared to other laptops and goes with me everywhere. Invest in a case if you want to keep it a beauty though (so shallow).::Mari M.::5.0::December 13, 2011
R23G6Y40AZCBT9::picture quality is crystal clear!!::I've had several laptops over the years - both personal n from work... so i wanted something that would really get me excited about owning a laptop and decided apple macbook pro would be ideal -it is!! The picture quality is just amazing and great for chatting online ..again because of the video quality.Initially while buying I was slighly confused about the colour of the laptop so just to let you'll know - its silver (doesn't come in any other colour for this specification). Its comes ready to use so no software installation or any other hassle. It is very intuitive and teaches you a whole new way of computing if you're willing to learn - you can drag n drop almost anything.The packaging was excellent and reached right on time - thanks to amazon prime!::phoenix4661::5.0::December 10, 2011

R2QR3M0GKHXNTP::Simply Amazing::This is my third Macbook Pro. I have loved every single one. I have used PC's for over 13 years and I must say the change to the Mac OS X has been the best I have ever made. Apple's products are built to last. I use this laptop every day and I must say it never skips a single beat. It was tricky using the new filing system with my old external hard drives but I discovered driver called NTFS-3G so I didn't have to reformat any of them and lose my data. Overall I am happy to have purchased my new baby of systems.The product is sleek and grabs your attention.The backlit keyboard is beautiful and wipes away clean every time.Its hard to get any type of smudge on the casing.One thing i do wish was that the screen came with a standard matte finish (antiglare) instead of the glossy display. It leads to major eyestrain if you are working on something outdoors.Overall a solid product!::nsing007::5.0::December 7, 2011
R9QNF03PJ1UF4::Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)::This is my first Apple computer that I bought and wow..I don't know where to start.I was contemplating between the 13" and the 15" but there is such a big price difference.I am glad I chose the 13" because the screen size is perfect for every day use. Plus I don't need the i7 processor.Now to the review:I have had 2 Windows laptops in the last 2 years (HP and Acer).The HP harddrive crashed on me and the Acer is just way too slow.I bought the Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (Fall 2011) version and I can't be happier.The first thing I noticed was how sleek it looked. It is all aluminum and felt like a well-built machine.After turning it on, it look around 15-20 seconds to boot up.The first thing you notice is how crisp all the icons and webpages looked. If you put the computer in maximum brightness, the colors are so vivid. I loaded my personal photo albums and the colors are vibrant. There is hardly any pixelation you get in other pc monitors.The keyboard is a chiclet type which feels so natural when typing. The trackpad is another great innovative part of this computer. You can customize the different gestures on the mousepad to make navigating a more enjoyable experience.The best thing about this product is probably the battery life. I got about 7-8 hours of use with average brightness. I never had this kind of battery life with other PC laptops. I had an ASUS netbook a year ago which gave me about 6-7 hours, but you get a slower processor speed and smaller screen. If you have copy of Windows 7, you can use this laptop to boot it and the interface looks so much better on this machine. You can use products like Pararell 7 or VM Fusion to toggle back and forth from Mac to Windows without ever restarting the computer.Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this product. The Lion OSX makes this computer a fun device to use. The speed is blazing fast. I never experienced any lag or slowness when opening multiple applications or programs. I can already say after using this for a few weeks that I am never touching a PC again!::Ray::5.0::December 5, 2011
R1R1L6YR4ETQUJ::My week-old Apple MacBook Pro laptop just died::My week-old Apple MacBook Pro laptop just died. My first experience with a Mac has shown nothing but technical incompetence. Their automated phone support system doesn't work and took me half of an hour to get a person who then told me he couldn't help me because that was a different department. They gave a $100 gift card with the Mac which didn't work (even though at Coffee Bean, Starbucks, etc. I've NEVER had issues with gift cards). Now the laptop itself dies after one week.  I'm forced to deal with this company because I teach programming, but it's beyond me how this company has grown to the size it has.  The laptop is twice as expensive as an equivalent Windows laptop and three times as expensive as an equivalent linux laptop.How does this company stay in business? Especially a tech company that can't its tech right!  I love and use linux. I use Windows and it works. So far all I've seen from Apple is terrible support people and a terrible product.::Nik Bear Brown "Balaramji"::1.0::July 4, 2012

RB2KT48KWSVG::Outstanding Laptop::I can't say enough about the excellent design and ease of use of this machine. I was reluctant to switch to a laptop that lacks an optical drive but now that I've tried it, there's no going back. The slim, lightweight design, iPad-like instant-on of all solid-state storage and superior battery life make this laptop a dream to use. It took me a day or two to fully adapt to the Mac OS X Lion operating system but now I love it. You can't go wrong with this pleasing and delightful computer.::Peter Rooney::5.0::November 29, 2011
R2UATQF4AR8BEW::Most Excellent::I have been an Apple laptop owner for the last 6 years now. The MacBook Pro line is, of course, at the top of Apple products. The setup of this machine was smooth. I was able to transfer all of the data and applications from my previous MacBook Pro to this new gadget without any issues at all. It is faster. It has more memory. I vote for the upgrade. Do it!::Sebylita "Sebylita"::5.0::November 12, 2011
R35TEFQPLX902J::Never going back::At first it thought $1100 for a laptop was waaaaaay to much! But after talking to a few friends whom had their macbooks for 2-3 years (i been through 2 in 2 years). I took a leap of faith and bought my first macbook pro. THE BEST INVESTMENT I EVER MADE!!! It took about a week to get used to but its well worth it! The muti-tasking dosent cause the system to slowdown at all. And after playing around with my moms HP I WILL BE A MACBOOK USER FOR A LONG TIME!!::airmax95::5.0::November 25, 2011
R1RMGK4NJE4MB5::the LED screen failed in less than a month::the LED screen failed in less than a month. it stated with some bright spots on the bottom of the screen. the whole screen went black a week later. I searched on apple.com's forum and apparently that issue wasn't new. it started in 2008 (I bought mine in 2012) and there were dozens of pages about this particular problem. obviously most apple fans have extreme tolerance of apple defects. I was looking for possible solution on the forum but all I found were silly comments like, "it's OK. it happens. bring it to the apple store and they'll exchange it for a new one." problem was, I had a new laptop. I didn't need another new one. I had just spent two weeks installing xcode because instead of letting you download this free programing workbench from a web page, apple forces you to buy it via apple store for free. I never had an itune account and for that reason, I couldn't simply set up my account on the newly purchased MacBook. I was on the phone with the apple genius and her supervisor for hours to no avail. they told me to use my windows laptop to first open an itune account but that didn't work either. they told me to wait for an email or phone the following day. nobody called or emailed and my account still didn't work the following day. then I called them and a few hours later it was working. apple geniuses are polite and often apologize. as a result, you can't really lash out at them. but there're useless. eventually, I didn't bring the laptop to the apple store because I didn't want another laptop, which would require me download xcode again. I brought it to an authorized dealer to have the screen replaced.::kMan::1.0::August 18, 2013

R2FPYFTYAL2FO3::Recommend!::I highly recommend getting some type of laptop sleeve with it, Laptop Sleeve 15 inch Neoprene Surf Art Style, there's something about this particular design that I just love. Makes such a difference now that I use it daily. Besides the actual case being lightweight and tough, it fits my Mac like a glove, I recommend it. In summary, the Apple Macbook Pro is second to none. The speed of the processor alone is worth the purchase price, my internet speed literally tripled when I first got online with my Mac. Highly Recommended!::Baker::5.0::June 19, 2012

R85GP45YZRWUL::No Boot Disk?::(This is the very first Apple I ever owned,( I have used them a lot before tho), so I dont know much about what comes with them if anything at all. This one only came with a charger)? AnywayUnfortunately I waited too long to check inside the package because when you buy a new computer you dont need the boot CD right away so I figured it was in there, inside the box, but much to my surprise I found out yesterday that the CD holder in the box is Empty!?I was wondering if the Seller does not include the Apple Boot CD with their new laptops? Or is this a mistake? Or is it extra? (I sure hope not cuz it is not the case with the PCs).How do I get my* boot disk?Thank You!*By "my" disk, I mean the CD that matches that exact model because they usually ship a backup copy with all the software etc, in case the HDD crashed or something happened which forced an OS reinstall.::Mehdi Bagheri "SMB"::4.0::May 6, 2012

Much more reliable than my husband's HP Laptop, which is always slow and multiple other issues!::momof3::5.0::April 27, 2012
R1IR4R1UFV1HNQ::Love my Mac::I have been a PC user all my life, but when it came to looking at new laptops, none really compared to the MacBook Pro. The 13.3 inch version is perfect for travelling with as it is tiny and very light weight. It is durable enough that I'm not concerned about it bouncing around in the bag, as I would be with some of the new ultrabooks. The downside to this is that the battery life says it is around 7 hours, and mine is fairly low after 4 hours, but that is also using it for 4 hours straight. For those users switching from PC, it is very easy to get the hang of the Mac. I will most likely continue to purchase Mac now.::Stephanie::5.0::April 20, 2012
R3DJ0T1631QHMB::This feels like I've been reunited with an old friend...::This is my second Macbook and although I haven't had a replacement for my first in about two years, this Pro feels like I've been reunited with an old and well loved friend.  This baby is a sleek and slim number that hardly gets warm or makes noise. Its a thing of beauty. The multitouch trackpad is an exceptional invention. It makes surfing the web effortless! On a whole, this macbook performs well and I'm very impressed with the attention Apple has paid to every single detail -it shows in the seamless way it works and feel and I'm sure every user will notice it. I'm glad I returned to a familiar friend...can't believe I waited so long.::Tamara Toney::5.0::April 19, 2012

R3E3JH9WK2205C::I enjoy my new Mac Book Pro::This 13 inch version of the MAC Book Pro is the first lap top I have owned.  I like it, although it's a bit heavy to carry around with me.  Right now the programs I am using are TExt Edit, for a book I am writing, and the digital output via heaphone link, so I can listen using an outboard digital to analog converter, to my I tunes and other music I have put on the MAC Book Pro.  I plan on adding a music server besides I tunes, so I can use the lap top as a digital transport for higher resolution audio, to be fed to my reciver, that is able to decode higher sampling rates than those available through I-tunes. I"m kind of an audiophile.  So I will be using the Mac Book Pro not only to write with, but also as a component in a high end audio system.::Paul F. Gordon::5.0::April 11, 2012

Apple makes great products. i only switched to Mac products a few years ago and it was well worth doing. I recommend this MacBook if your on a budget. I think it is well worth the price and is around $62 cheaper than buying it from an Apple store or their online store.::J. Newman "Jason fan"::5.0::February 26, 2012
RRZ8VWVGXSMCV::New Macbook Pro Owner::After having been a user of Windows based computers for the past 21 years, I felt it was time for a change.  My last computer was a Compaq Presario that I bought in '07, and after a little over four years, its on it last legs.  I bought it with Vista installed on it and was sick and tired of the irritating crashes, screen freezes, time intensive updates, etc.  Additionally, it reached the point a couple of months ago where, I started getting messages saying an application failed, and shortly after that, the screen would flicker, and the entire taskbar along the bottom of the screen would just disappear.  About 15-20 minutes later, it would flicker and reappear.  If I was downloading anything when it flickered, I would lose it and have to start all over while dealing with the screen continously freezing.  So yesterday I went to the Apple store and bought a Macbook Pro and the only thing I have to say after having had it for 24 hours, is what took me so long?  Its a breeze to setup, not to mention it boots up in like 10 seconds and is ready to go.  No more waiting two or three minutes for my computer to boot up, followed by another minute or so for my home screen to populate itself and finally be ready for use.  I really like the Facetime camera and all of the effects you can create in it using iPhoto.  I'm still getting acclimated to Mac OS X Lion but thats not a problem.  To anyone considering making switch, I say go for it...you won't regret it.UPDATE:  3/1/11 Just attempted to create my first DVD using iMovie and I had planned to use iDVD but found that newer model MAcbook Pros are no longer being shipped with iDVD as a part of the iLife suite.  After speaking with Apple, I found that iDVD was discontinued because you can now create DVDs using the Finder menu.  This is a great product.::Steve::5.0::February 23, 2012

R335U5AVH3O7QJ::Bottom Line::Alright.. I read most reviews before buying. Most of the negative reviews don't make sense.  I'm not sure why the people that wrote them feel so angry about Apple stuff. Maybe they did get lemons. Not sure. I'm very computer savy. Been using selling and enjoying computers since late 80's. I used to sell them at Price Club, now Costco, when the max proccessor speed was 4.77MHz and and two 5.25 inch floppys...360k. 8088 computerThen came 286, then 386, then 386sx, dx, 486 and so on....My first laptop....386 with 20mb hardrive and monochrome screen....Owned & operated a bulletin board out of Anchorage prior to Gore "inventing" the internetI know most have clicked past this uninteresting review..but listenThis is an amazing machine...Some say Apple is over priced. Please consider anything that compares to a pc lap/note computer that has the build quality of the unibody MBP.Won't find anyI love my Dell Studio 8000 desktop  at my house. Very powerfull and can do anthing I throw at it, but I also like Mac.Lion 10.7 was defiantly different than what I was used to with windows 7. But not that much different.I really like Safari and am know using it instead of IE on my desktop.I am computer literate. Mac or PC...doesn't matter. I just really appreciate both and am very thankfull and impressed with the current technology.I added 512gb ssd drive and 16gb ram.

R12HGDQVI3DJFG::If you like Apple, then it's a good deal::Amazon had a sale on the refreshed MacBook Pros even after Cyber Monday, so I picked one up. It arrived in 3-4 days, and is exactly what the reviews of the late 2011 MBP say it is. It's for my wife and just hassle-free computing, and it delivers on that promise, with all the bonuses and missing parts of OSX.This is really a review of Amazon. If you like the device, it ships just like from Apple.Only caveat, their free shipping doesn't require a signature, so UPS left it in front of my door while I was traveling for work. Yeah.::Roy Wang F::4.0::January 1, 2012

R1Z987DEAR23WW::Good product. Good design::I like this Macbook pro, which is for my girl friend. Safe metal case, good OS, beautiful design. By the way, I bought when it was $1050.  I am pretty satisfied about its price and quality. It's worthy.::Glast::5.0::December 8, 2011
R6W2F9GZZ0FU6::Really good laptop. Amazing battery life.::This laptop is perfect. I extremely love the battery life, it can last up to 6 hours! Also I love the OSX Lion operating system. It is very easy to work with, and awesome multitasking. The only problem is that it is not 100% compatible with Windows 7. More than 80% of the files are compatible, but not all. Overall I love the Laptop.::Kian Dalvandi::5.0::December 7, 2011

R14DN4P7P4UH4L::APPLE MAC BOOK PRO::This is exactly what I wanted in a laptop. I have the 21 inch MAC for home use and couldn't wait until I could buy a Mac Book. I have been out of town where I couldn't get internet service, but was able to write letters with TextEdit to copy when I returned home. I am so new to having this laptop, that all I can say is, I love it and it was worth the wait to get the Apple Mac Book Pro to go with my Big Mac at home!!::MW. WALKER::5.0::May 29, 2012
R3M99ZWISX968T::Good for media consumption and creation...::I've been working on an iPad app for five months on this Macbook Pro. I will come forth and admit I've traditionally been a PC person and I appreciate the flexible environments it offers for businesses, programmers, and developers as well as providing tools to create complex business-geared applications. Mac OS X, as pleasant as it is to use, has such a controlled experience to the point it dampens technical creativity. I can't help but compare the MacBook to a game console like the Xbox or PS3. It restricts your activities to just consuming media rather than creating anything with the exception of movies, music, and visual publications. Granted Microsoft Office did get re-released for Mac OS X, it still condones an environment of massive media consumption and consumer amusement rather than productivity. I understand that was the intent though. Apple wanted to create an experience that they defined and controlled to keep the user experience streamlined. But Apple is out to solve people's personal problems and create consumer amusement, not solve the technical problems of the world businesses faces every day. It's a cruel irony that Apple claims to unleash people's creativity but then turns around and dictates everything the user cannot do. I am not allowed to make an app without a $100 fee and an approval process conducted by them, and I certainly cannot explore the technical beauty of Apple technology that they have so securely locked down.The tools to create programs on Mac OS X and iOS were a major disappointment to me. I really wanted Apple XCode to be pleasant to use so I could pursue making mobile apps on my own time, but it was like programming in the 1990's. Everything about Objective-C is so archaic and dated, and Apple knows this as it scrambles producing massive updates that completely overhaul the coding patterns every three months. If you buy a book on Apple programming, you can expect to have a nice paperweight within three months. The debugging tools are a nightmare and unless you are a hardcore C programmer do not expect this to be some nice, shiny Visual Studio-esque IDE. Although each massive update to Xcode adds new features that improves the coding experience (like ARC garbage collection, praise Jesus!), the obsolescence of prior coding paradigms creates massive headaches for programmers.  Apple is so far behind when it comes to serving developers' needs because every app and line of code was done in-house by Apple until recently. They had to open up iOS a little and let non-Apple employees make apps.In summary, Apple makes consumer products and consumer solutions, not enterprise or developer. Do not buy a Macbook expecting it will help you be productive especially in enterprise or business settings. It primary purpose is consumption and making it otherwise takes a ton of work.::T.

R33AUAEKJYE4ZQ::I HEART MACS::My family has always been a Mac family. We have videos of me sitting at our old Mac Tower and typing random letters into Indesign. I don't actually have my MacBook Pro yet, but my mom has one and as do my friends. I have to say, the MacBook Pro is incredible! It's fast, though will occasionally freeze, the battery life is awesome unless you're running many complicated applications and other fancy schmancy things at once, and the physical computer is really nice. The keyboard is really fun to type on and the trackpad is awesome. I can't wait to get my Mac!::TheAwesomeMachine::5.0::January 19, 2012
R8NO5VUCF9DAZ::MacBook pro 13::The best laptop ever. I love the touchpad. It's nothing like all the other brand laptops. If your the type of person who likes the top of the line laptop, then you shouldnt hesitate to get an apple MacBook pro. You are wasting your time trying to decide what kind of laptop to choose. Apple is the most innovative, they have the best operating system, they are immune to viruses, and all of the above. The price you pay is well worth each buck. The MacBook pro is a great investment, you can't go wrong with it. If you try other brands, your garuntee to get a virus on it and end up wasting ur investment on it and forced to get a new one. So if your looking for the best quality computer, go with apple.::Ronald Manansala::5.0::December 1, 2011
R391B088LR7QO4::Windows to Mac::The first computer I have purchase which runs on a Mac platform. I will still continue to use my Windows computers as I believe they are more geared towards the businessman, but the Macbook is something that I will use at home. I enjoy this machine. Very light, user friendly and crash-free.::Chris Parish "Chris Parish"::4.0::December 1, 2011
R1YYQMIERI6B8::First Review!  Mac is Awesome Once More.::This MacBook is great.  I just bought it from Bestbuy and it offers all the best of the previous generation, but it's faster, cooler, and I'm pretty sure the Trackpad performs better (if that'seven possible).  The only way to go is Mac, because the battery life is phenomenal, the screen is vivid, and it's extremely light and portable.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that I bought the 13.3 inch.  It's small, even for a portable.  If you're an avid laptop enthusiast, try to shoot for the 15 inch.  Thanks Apple, RIP Steve Jobs.::Anthony Chapman::5.0::October 30, 2011
R39NV0WDAOBR01::Macbooks are great if you dont get one from the regular bad batches!::I was so excited and happy with my macbook pro 13 at the beginning. Loved the graphics, layout, easy use... everything.I bought mine in October 2011, so 6 months ago from now.Unfortunately after only 3 months of use it started to go to hell. My macbook now constantly drops the wi-fi connection - I have to turn it on and off about every 5 minutes to be able to even load pages. I know that it has nothing to do with the router or wi-fi connection itself because I live in a house sharing the internet with 6 other people - it works perfectly for them, and 3 of them own macbooks or imacs themselves. Regardless of whether they're home or not, for me the problem still persists.I am not alone on this, if you search for it you find that tons of people have this same problem - and there is still no fix for it. Even after having gone via applecare they havent gotten anywhere.I feel so disappointed and tricked that I decided to go for a macbook!::Olivia::1.0::April 5, 2012
R2UQLADGOU8DOQ::Decent computer, but high price tag::UPDATE ON 5/31/12:  I returned the computer.  The final straw was the constant popups using the family filter.  The filter doesn't allow secure https websites, and it seemed that every website you visited it was trying to connect to 3 or 4 of them.  Even going to a website like Sports Illustrated, it would popup that it didn't allow about three secure websites, like facebook.com, and some random ones that I've never heard of before.  But you could go straight to the website, albeit the unsecure one, so I don't know what the point was.  I started just logging in and accepting all the websites that the filter was warning me about, but it never stopped.  If you google this problem, this has been an issue for many years with Apple users.  I just expect more from a computer if I'm going to pay that much for it.  The good news is that I've grown to love our iPad, which allows me to quickly access the Internet, which is what I mainly use a laptop for, anyway.VERDICT:  Macs can be considered the Lexus of computers.  You pay more, and you expect more.  But just like a Lexus might give you problems, and there may be things about the car you don't care for, the same things go for Macs.  Do you drive a Lexus in real life, or is a Toyota good enough?  Even if the Toyota uses the same engine and chassis?  I drive a Toyota, but decided to splurge on this MacBook.  I'm glad I got it, at the least to see what the fuss is about.  This is my first Apple since my 1985 Apple IIc, and it's a very nice product.  But I'm not convinced to buy a Mac for my next computer.There is basically a rivalry between Apple aficionados and people who don't understand what makes Macs so great.  The success of iPhones have made Apple people even more intolerable (and increased their numbers).  What a lot of people don't realize is that Office is the top selling software for Macs in the world.  So they basically buy an Apple to run Microsoft products.  And if Windows was the piece of crap that Apple people say it is, then it would have gone the way of the Yugo by now, rather than being on 95% of personal computers.  Granted, a huge reason that Windows is so popular is that it runs on computers that don't have a huge markup on their hardware.  Don't be mistaken that the hardware is blessed by Apple; they use the same vendors.  A Dell Inspiron 14R laptop has a 14" monitor, Intel i5 2.5GHz processor, 6GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM, and a 750GB hard drive for $640.00.  This MacBook Pro has a 13.3" monitor, Intel i5 2.4GHz processor, 4GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM, and a 500 GB hard drive for $1,200.00.  Both have USB ports, DVD drives, etc.  So you're practically paying twice as much for something that isn't quite as nice, as far as hardware goes.  Yes, Windows is put on some crappy computers (I'm looking at you, HP/Compaq), but you can't use the crappiest Windows computers as an example of Mac's superiority.  There are a few other hardware differences, like the Thunderbolt port, which is basically a fancy name for their HDMI port.  And they have magnets to hold the lid shut and attach the power cord, which are so minor they are hardly worth mentioning.As far as Mac OS X vs. Windows 7, let me be the first to say that Windows 7 is a huge disappointment, although better than Vista was.  I wish we could still get Windows XP.  It's almost like Windows is trying to get too cute, a.k.a. more like a Mac.  And Mac does some things much easier than Windows, such as the Family Filter.  It's already on the Mac, and super easy to set up on profiles.  With Windows, you have to download it, install it, then sign up for their crap, blah, blah, blah.  But there are some things I really miss from Windows, like a right click button (you can hold down one of the keyboard buttons on the Mac to get the menus, however).  And I like having my open programs on the taskbar in Windows, instead of that icon bar on Macs, where it's not clear what programs are open.  There are some other minor learning curves, like the close window button is on the left instead of the right, and the infamous Ctrl+Alt+Del combo is some other keys, which I forgot.  You get to scroll and zoom using two fingers, which are neat tricks.  But I wish there was a way to lock the computer (like you can with Windows) so updates could continue to be downloaded while you're away from the computer.  If you log off, sleep, or shut down the computer, the downloads stop.  You have to wait until the screen saver kicks in to keep the downloads going and not worry about someone getting on your profile.As far as software goes, that big problem has basically gone away.  Microsoft Office on the Mac can open files made from Windows, and vice versa.  All the major programs are available for Mac, like Firefox, Google Chrome, Quicken, Openoffice, etc.  And the Mac comes with some great programs to edit video and pictures.  A program would have to be pretty remote to require only Windows.  And if that's the case, then you can even buy Windows ($100) and install it on your Mac, so you wouldn't need a separate computer.Basically, the reason I bought it is because my wife and kids are in love with their iPod Touches and iPads.  But I don't believe Apple products have halos over them.  I personally can't stand iTunes.  Amazon is WAY better; they don't require a download, it's easier to group your songs, and you don't have to worry about trying to convert the files to MP3s so they can play on non-Apple products.  I think the iPod Nano is not user-friendly with its scroll wheel.  I prefer Chrome and Firefox over Safari.  (IE? Yuck.)  And replacing your battery yourself voids your warranty?  Not everyone lives next door to an Apple Store to get the battery replaced.I think that if Apple sold their Macs more in line with what they are worth, their market share would increase tenfold, but it looks like they prefer for Google to try to come up with something to threaten Microsoft's market stranglehold.  For now, I believe the reason people buy Macs is the same reason that people buy Lexuses.  They think their product is so much better to warrant the price tag.  I plan to enjoy this MacBook, just like I plan to continue to enjoy my Windows desktop.  But I'm not sure about the hype that they are worth twice as much as a Windows computer from a reputable manufacturer.  And although Lexus is a better car, I'm not trading my Toyota in for one, either.::TitleWriter::2.0::May 23, 2012

R2F0OQ8P8LOKJY::Animation Student::I purchase this laptop for my son due to his major in college. I went to Fry's and it was $1199 to $1699, with books and tuition the price was out of my range.

R24PNUA805HUWJ::Overrated::I switched from a PC to a Mac a year and a half ago and to be honest it's not worth the price difference. Macs have a better operating system but seem deficient everywhere else. The built-in wireless antenna is worse and, unlike PCs, you can't buy an external one. They also overcharge you for every adapter ($28 for an external display that doesn't even fit properly). My real complaint, however, is the design. There are only two USB ports on the laptop and although you can add external hubs, you will reach a point where the laptop fails to read them all at once (keep in mind if you own an iphone, you will be down to just one). The head scratching element to this is that they are side by side! Half of the usb plugs won't fit without blocking the other plug or using a hub to begin with. Can't imagine with all the people at Mac who went into determining this design, there wasn't one person who caught this.::GS::2.0::November 25, 2011

R3AV4XZ9C48XYY::Not the same apple quality::Ive owned apple for over 8 years, and I've got to say that the last three computer I have bought from them have been some of the  worse computers I have owned. There quality in the last few years has really took a nose dive. Not just hardware failures, but every operating system has become more bogged down, slow, and so unresponsive. I remember back when I would upgrade to a newer OS with my computer it would actually make it run better. Back in the tiger and panther days. Not just are they double the price of a windows computer, but they seem to have more and more acclimating issues. I won't be purchasing a new computer from apple in the future.::Gabe Johnson "Gman"::1.0::April 18, 2012

R3KMKCLEPEUVHU::Insanely Great or Just Insane?::Purchased this item from Amazon 6 months ago. Its had 3 warranty related hardware problems. I'd like to personally thank Tim Cook and his brilliant Supply Chain Management skills for the defective components. I brought the computer into the Apple Millenia Store in Orlando, Fl. for evaluation and repair by the Not-So-Genius Amnesiac Bar on December 31, 2011. Two weeks later the computer is still sitting there. Nobody has a status on anything. The computer was possibly hacked and compromised while in Apple's possession.The Apple Store is impossible to communicate with, they seem to refuse to communicate with the BBB as well, where I've filed a complaint. Its like the Chris Nolan movie Memento where the main character completely loses his memory every 15 minutes. At the Apple Store it's every 10 nanoseconds.All in all, a terrible experience. If Windows 8 is even 70% as good as it looks, this Lemon will be in the trash where it belongs. Either way, I will never buy another Apple product again.::Gary "Gary"::1.0::January 13, 2012

REOD1QPMOIC5H::It's that good::I was a life long windows user. I had the HP Envy 17. i7 with 8 gb of ram 640 gb hd as my last computer.I like windows 7, its a very good platform. But I think I've been turned into an Apple guy. The computer like others say is beautiful, but along with that it's well made. The keyboard not having a numbers pad took some getting used to but the lay out of the keys with backlighting is great. The speakers aren't great but they are good enough. The startup & shutdown is fast. I've added windows7 to it so I have it if I need it.The battery doesn't last 7 hours but it does last quite awhile, much longer than my HP with extended battery did. The battery life makes it great for school as I dont have to charge it in class. The only time its gets hot is watching flash videos. There are still a lot of shortcuts on the keyboard I need to learn.::Andrew::5.0::February 10, 2012
R3E4K01IQZK3ES::Great Laptop::Everything you come to expect from Apple. First Mac after a life of windows and I can see why macs are popular. Trackpad and multifinger features are great and easy to pick up. Effortless Multi application running. Great build quality. Still getting used to non windows interface but is fairly easy to pick up. Gets you working quickly straight out the box. Easy to get mail accounts and wifi going. Only negative is price, you do pay for the build quality etc I also wonder about extent of available software. Very happy with product so far::Alex::5.0::January 29, 2012
R1PGG04M4GC0TY::Most amazing laptop experience ever..!::Let me start by saying that less than 6 months ago I had purchased a pretty decent Fujitsu laptop running Windows 7 ultimate and I am comparing the Macbook pro experience with that. Let me also state that this is not my first macbook or apple product either. I have a macbook (2006), an iPad, iPhone and multiple iPods. But after having opened the packaging on my latest Macbook pro, I cannot believe how easy to use and frustration free it is compared to the PC. The trackpad is simply magical, Browsing has become a pleasure again, after having suffered with kludgy gestures with the Fujitsu, it feels like a dream to be browsing and pretty much doing anything on the Macbook pro. I am a heavy trackpad user normally and this is a dream come true for me. Of course this is still early days for me and I have not really put the performance of the macbook to test yet  and am hoping to update my review once the honeymoon phase wears off. But so far, I feel this machine is worth every penny Apple charges for it.::Amazon Customer "vettrivel"::5.0::December 30, 2011
R3U1NJIKYMUQ9T::MacBook Pro 15"::I ordered this during the Thanksgiving holiday. UPS let someone sign for it and I never received it. I got with Amazon and after a little back and forth with customer service they shipped one out the same day. Amazon upgraded the shipping to next day through FedEx and gave me a store credit for my troubles. This time around I had it held at the sorting facility.The MacBook was easy to setup and start using just like previous Macs I have owned. One thing I like is that the Macbook comes out of sleep very quickly and is ready to go. Others have complained about the battery life but I haven't had any problems. I use it for college to write papers and do research. The new gestures in OS Lion toke a little bit to get used to but not a big deal. Overall I am happy with my MacBook and I don't have any complaints.::JMarioValenz::5.0::December 27, 2011
R2RVVHXQCNI3K2::At Last::I had been putting off moving to Mac for a while.  Finally made the leap and am so glad I did.  The setup was painless and incredibly quick.  I had been using a 17" Dell XPS and was a little concerned about the response of the video card, but all is well.  No issues with my drafting or machine programming software.  I use "prime" shipping with amazon and received it in 1 business day.  For anyone that buys from Amazon frequently, go with the prime plan. The down side to this purchase, my wife wants one now.::REVJWH::5.0::December 2, 2011
R2K3EWKCKYDD5D::Great Laptop but...::This is a great laptop first of all. The trackpad and battery are such great conveniences especially since I'm using mine for college. It looks great, runs great, and EXCELLENT customer service from Apple.Alright I've spent 30 minutes trying to think of other things that I like about this laptop. Now here's the thing, it's probably just me, but I don't see anything that makes this laptop better than a PC. My main reason of getting this laptop was to see how great it was, since everyone was talking about it, and recommending it to me. I've had it for 4 months now, and I have no clear idea of how it could beat a laptop that's half its price. I love playing Starcraft 2, but I have to run it on the lowest settings, while my PC with the same specifications can run it on high. So either right now, there's nothing different, or I'm not utilizing my Macbook Pro to its fullest potential. If I am, someone please comment so I could get a better experience with this.Don't get me wrong, it's still a great laptop, and I love the thing, but I do regret switching. I swear I'm not a troll looking to start a PC vs Mac war, I just want to state my opinions, and hopefully someone tells me whether I'm wrong or right with a reason why.EDIT: Let's make this clear, I didn't buy this laptop for gaming. I bought it mainly based on recommendations, battery life, and durability.Thanks Nathan and Geib, I just ordered the 8 GB RAM, and it should be here soon. I don't think I would've searched for them since, I didn't think they'd be that cheap (well... not cheap, but a low price compared to what I was thinking haha).As for viruses, I never got them with my PC, but it's nice to know that it's not just luck that I'm not getting them lol.::Nathan::5.0::November 20, 2011

R1HUZ9AZH3SZJ5::Internet Recovery is useless after hard drive fails::I have always been a Windows user but decided to purchase a Macbook due to several friends telling me how great and reliable Macs are.  My machine was loaded with the Lion OS, and while I didn't find the interface to be as wonderful as I was told, I was fairly satisfied with my experience until last week.  My hard drive died.  I backed up my data regularly, so this was only a disappointment in having to spend the additional money on a new one within a year of purchasing the laptop.  However, retrieving the OS through Internet Recovery has been a nightmare.  I can't simply download the software from a PC and then load it to my Mac. That's not an option at all.  It must be downloaded from the non-functioning Mac through Apple's servers that error out every time I try to download it through Internet Recovery. I connected the machine via ethernet cable to my modem and temporarily turned off network security in order to download the OS.  To absolutely no avail, it never would download! Because this wasn't under warranty, I would be charged $100 for an authorized repair provider to load it to my machine.  Absolutely ridiculous! Apple advertises there is no need to purchase a copy of the OS (and no longer offers another way to purchase a copy of it), since it can be retrieved through Internet Recovery. That method should work!  I've checked and double-checked, and there is no reason on my end for these Internet recovery errors to continuously occur. Since Apple no longer sells the thumb drive with Lion loaded, I had to go through a third party to purchase it (still less than taking it to a repair shop).  Should I have created my own recovery thumb drive prior to this occurring?  Clearly, I'd say yes now, and have always created bootable cd's for my PC's in the past.  However, Apple advertises a service that supposedly allows the user to always have access to the OS in emergencies such as these, but it fails to deliver as advertised.  This is a big issue, in my opinion, and has definitely turned me off of their overpriced products.::Uggh::1.0::December 23, 2012
R33TEITAY3VGP6::Worth the price::After considering many lower cost PC options, I went with the MacBook.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Overall design factors include a superior track pad interface, solid construction, back-lit keyboard, superior OS, terrific display, etc.  There are some higher end PC notebook solutions available but the cost difference really isn't that much between these solutions and the MacBook.  You get what you pay for and them some with this MacBook.I have no need to use an external mouse with this notebook due to an inferior track-pad interface found on most PC notebooks.  I have observed that the mouse pointer will jump around at times on PC notebooks due to sensitivity issues.  Other reviewers have observed the same behavior. This is likely due to the sensing of the palm by the track-pad.  Additionally, the track-pad on the PC solutions is often too small.  Often, these solutions need to include at least two buttons for left and right clicking and sometimes four just to accommodate users who are accustom to using buttons on the top or bottom of the track-pad.  The track-pad on the MacBook is a button itself and that is all that is needed.  Apple in effect is telling users to evolve and you will be better off.One thing worth noting about the MacBook is it does have sharp edges.  This allows the notebook to close such that there is no gap around the perimeter of the notebook.  However, if you are a user that rests your wrists on the notebook while typing instead of letting them float above the keypad, you will get many creases on your wrists and will likely feel some irritation.  This may ultimately result in more significant wrist injuries. When I first started using this notebook, my wrists did exhibit these creases so I adjusted my typing position by floating my hands above the keyboard as recommended.  Problem solved!  Apple design engineers are in effect saying "learn to type correctly."  Additionally, I purchased the following item to place the MacBook in a slanted orientation.  It also helps with heat dissipation and is very portable.  Having the notebook in the slanted orientation will also fix the issue with the sharp edges if you insist on not floating your hands above the keyboard while typing. I highly recommend it:Hercules X-Stand Ergonomic Portable Natural Airflow Cooling Stand For all 12-17" Laptop / Notebook ComputersI decided to go with the 1680 x 1050 display rather than the lower resolution display.  I believe that this is definitely worth the extra money.  Additionally, I considered the matte screen to mitigate the effects of screen reflections but ultimately decided to go with the glossy screen due to its vibrancy.  There can be issues with reflections so if you are a user that has a window directly behind you or work in an environment that has bright lights, you may want to opt for the matte screen. Reflections have not been an issue for me.  I recommend the glossy screen for most users.My system has 8 Gig of RAM.  Running a few applications will eat up memory fairly quickly.  Once memory runs low, the OS will need to swap memory to the hard disk thus compromising performance.  According to Apple, use of RAM that is not exactly the same as what is specified (same specs and manufacture) will void the warranty.  You may want to consider that if you are looking at the possibility of adding your own RAM which you can do for significantly less than what Apple charges which is $200 for 4 Gig more than the base model which has 4 Gig of RAM itself.  Contact Apple first if you have any doubts about such warranty issues.In summary,  all of the components of the MacBook are integrated so well with the OS that it is truly the superior solution. This is simply because Apple has virtually complete control of the OS and hardware.  Without going into the technical details here, this makes a huge difference when compared to solutions based on Windows that need to accommodate multiple hardware platforms from many notebook manufactures.::Gerald::5.0::February 6, 2012
R5NUQGHW7JP7D::Excellent laptop - Long time mac user::I was little concern about the battery and heat before my purchase because all reports that has been posted on the internet. I finally received this new macbook pro 2.2Ghz and after few days I can tell this is an excellent computer.The computer doesn't overheat running light stuff like Safari, iTunes, Spotify, etc.. so It is running OK for me.About the battery, yes, it is true.. I can get round 3 o 4 hours depending of my use. I installed gfxCardStatus to force the HD3000 when running on battery and it has improved it a little bit.Compared to my previous macbook pro (old 2007 Santa Rosa), The only thing I miss is the keyboard of my old computer; this one feels "cheap", but you'll get use to it after few days.I would definitely buy it again; the computer is extremely fast; I only need to buy a SSD to make it the even better.::Yolanda::5.0::December 8, 2011
R2RJYULD5MVMJU::Love the computer, but...::I purchased the MacBook Pro 15.4" laptop on Amazon and was delighted to receive it promptly. It came in exactly the same beautiful packaging as it would have had I picked it up directly from the Apple Store, BUT... I discovered that since I did not purchase it directly from the Apple Store, that I could not purchase One-to-One Apple Support. Apparently, Apple does not offer that service unless you buy your computer from their store, even if you purchase from an authorized reseller, like Amazon. This was disappointing to me.::dianaleona::4.0::March 12, 2012
R2LN8QWHNLFXDI::Very Pleased... long time windows converted MAC fan::I've debated switching to Mac for many years and am very happy with the Macbook Pro 15" I purchased.  I've been a windows user for 20+ years and thought about the switch but never could convince myself to make the change.  The Mac Book Pro is handsdown the best laptop I've ever used, and the Mac OS x operating system is also great.  The switch wasn't nearly as painful as I expected and I still haven't mastered all of the quirks that are different between mac & windows; command v. control for example.  From the initial setup on this has been the best computer experience I've had.  Migrated info from my pc very easily including outlook email and calender info and all of my pictures.  It also detected and setup the two hp printers we have on our home network.  It took me 30 min to set up the HP printer on my wife's laptop when she brought a second printer for work.  The macbook detected it, asked if I wanted to install and viola i was able to print.  It just does so many things easy than the pc and I didn't think it would.  The battery life is not as great as claimed but I expected that being an iphone, ipad user apple always exaggerates battery life.  it does get hot and fan can be loud, but i think the reviews that gripe about that aren't factoring in that all laptops are like that, it's not just a symptom of the macbook.::William Young::5.0::December 5, 2011
R3NFO5MZCMJTAA::Amazing::Having started using PC since late 80s I have owned at least 20+ PCs and this is my first MAC.  I am a software developer and like others who said, I am never going back.::YUTING HUANG::5.0::November 13, 2011
RXFIB9MXVBW2P::Very nice product but once put to use, didn't like.::I bought the Macbook Pro in order to make a move from the Windows world in which I had Windows Vista.  I was very surprised on how well the product was designed and the pleasure one gets just looking at it, its by far the best looking laptop out there, but once I started using it became apparent that I was in for a surprise.  I know a little more than the average user about computers and will let you know the pros and cons as I experienced them.Pros- Best laptop design out there. Very nice Aluminum design.- Very Good battery life.  Once the brightness is adjusted to auto.- Best trackpad i've ever used.  It can recognized whether I have 3 fingers on it or just one.  Great.- Backlit keyboard.  Very nice and it turns on automatically depending on light.- Great Webcam.  The webcam is great, very nice resolution.- Solid State Drive.  I payed extra for it but its definately worth it.Semi-consThese Semi cons are because of the awesome design.- Only 2 usb ports.- No additional battery support or interchangable for that matter. The battery is good but not infinite, need more juice.- Can't support mini discs but then again barely anyone uses those, but I mention it because I bought a amplified wifi adaptor that brought one and had to save the drivers on hd first.CONS (hardware)Where do I start there are so many cons that I will just focus on the ones that affected me directly.- No Bluray drive.  I have a PS3, tons of blurays and couldn't take any of my movies with me on the road.- No USB 3.0 support.  I bought a hard drive that is usb 3.0 but couldnt take advantage of the speed.  I have an internal SSD and the speed would've helped.- No HDMI built in. I had to buy a separate adaptor for it, this is a con because I payed $2200 for my Mac and I didn't want to spend more money.- The fan kept coming on when I was running Parallels in order to use much needed Windows features (read the other cons to know why).  A laptop fan helped ease that but I noticed the Aluminum was coming back to bite me on this one as it was loud.CONS (software)This is where I don't like this machine. At first it seemed I didn't need anything else and I would be able to do everything, but then it became apparent that I would be needing a lot.- No NTFS write support.  I found myself trying to copy things into my old hard drive and couldn't do it.  I would drag files to it and they wouldn't drop, no warning, nothing.  I did some research and found out that you can't do that without buying software.  At least Mac OS should let you know it's not supported, instead they choose not to let you know. Linux even supports this.- No games.  No games worth playing are available for the MacOS, I wanted to play some games on my down time and was surprised as to the games that are actually available.- Lack of software.  If I wanted to find a software for whatever it may be, all I had to do was search and I was almost guaranteed to find it for windows, with the Mac is kind of a surprise, "like wow it's on the Mac too, sweet".  Windows would be needed for lots of business programs.- Quicktime player.  I was wondering exactly what does Quicktime support and basically 2 file formats which didn't work for me since most of my stuff is in Divx and WMV.  I had to download VLC.  The main reason why this is a CON is because i shouldn't have to download a tool for every little thing I want to do.- Using Windows.  This is a con because Apple sells their operating system as the most advance but yet feel the need to include bootcamp so you can put Windows.  I don't get it but there are even companies that sell software so you can run windows within Mac OS which clearly fixes a lot of problems with Mac, but it shouldn't come down to that.  Windows doesn't support you to use MAC OS (even though Apple makes it illegal) or linux for that matter and i'm not talking about dual boot or virtual machines, I'm talking about using them at the same time like with Fusion or Parallels (virtual but integrates windows with Mac OS). The way I feel is that if you say your operating system is the best you shouldn't include a way to use the inferior one.  Obviously Mac OS lost points with me on that one, basically saying that they lack features and you should use Windows.- No customization.  You basically can't customize anything and I mean anything. its hard to find programs on there also, if you dont have them on the dock.The list can go on but these were things that bothered me and when you factor in price, this is not the best thing I couldve done for $2200 plus all the software.It looks nice but in the end falls short to live up to the hype of replacing a windows machine for the more advanced user.  I need the ability to own the system and customise it however I please.  In the end I decided to go back to a Windows 7  machine which can do anything Lion can do and much much more.  One of the main selling points was the lack of viruses for Mac, but I noticed that if you don't go looking around the internet for free stuff from shady sites or clicking spam, you shouldn't even need anti-virus for your Mac or PC.  Windows PCs are bigger targets due to more than 90 percent of the computers out there.I went back to the Apple store to return the product and they tried selling me on keeping it by telling me it can do all this stuff but once I started asking the hard questions I started getting "it's a Mac" from the salesperson, like I was supposed to forget about what I use a computer for and keep cause "mac is cool".  In my research the only thing that a Mac can do that a windows machine can't is run Apple made software like Final Cut Pro.  It became apparent at the Apple store that the main feature it offers is the ability to run Windows.I didn't like the product and hope my review will be able to educate someone on the fence on whether it is worth the price.  People will disagree with my review I'm sure but I have wrote the honest truth and no one can argue with the facts.  In the commercials Apple makes it sound like it's the most advanced thing ever and in the end maybe its too advance, coming from the future where no one uses Bluray, USB 3.0 or does actual work on their computers just surf the web and spend hours of time building ficticious farms.Thanks.Final word: Audi talks trash on BMW but doesn't feel the need to include a way to use a BMW engine in their cars.  Apple clearly knows that windows is better and it shows on them adding a way to use Windows but at the same time saying it sucks.::Joel::2.0::February 21, 2012
R10U6H4SURPTUZ::Great Service!::I love the computer, but knew I would.  I had problems registering it with Apple, but the seller, was very supportive and provided me all of the documentation that I needed to get the issue resolved.Would definitely buy from them again!  The computer is exactly what I wanted... a brand new "older version" MacBook Pro with the built in DVD.::BGK::5.0::May 19, 2014

R1XMMFR77BKDHV::Serious GPU/Logicboard Problem::One week after receiving the unit I started to have serious problem with blue screen appearing on during starting process.I was forced to send the macbook to the professional service. If I have luck and reballing will solve the problem, then the costs will not kill me, but if it is a logic board problem and it needs to be replaced (over 700 bugs!!!) then the day I purchased this used macbook pro was not my happiest day...::Maciej Burniak::2.0::April 11, 2014
R373584279PL5D::DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER::After receiving the MacBook laptop that Hapon sold to us as "in perfect like new condition", I immediately experienced problems with screen pixeling, etc.  The problems grew more and more extensive and the computer would completely shut down.  The computer finally reached of point of not even booting up only three months after we received it from Hapon.  I finally took it to an Apple Specialist who evaluated it and said the hard drive was not original and was damaged - two sided tape (rather than a hard drive bridge) was used to hold the hard drive and other components in place, and over time the tape had melted leaving the components to shift around and also leaving a sticky residue - one USB port was not even functional - other components were completely missing - the logic board was damaged -  and on and on.  I contacted the seller and he refused to make good on a very expensive purchase.  I would never trust this seller again.  We have been loyal Amazon customers for MANY years and know that this is not typical of how Amazon does business or allows their customers to be treated.  Extremely disappointed.::B. W. Willis::1.0::April 1, 2014
R74MXY4RDGGBI::15" MacBook Pro is a keeper::I've had a lot of MacBooks(6+) and this is the one I've decided to keep. I swapped the HD for a Samsung 830 SSD and everything loads so fast, it's like using an iPad or iPhone. The resolution is a little low, but colors are vibrant and the workspace is acceptable for writing and webpage viewing. The speakers sound great for such a thin laptop, with vibrant warm sound. The video card (AMD 6750m) lets you play games such as Diablo 3 at native resolution and high details, while the integrated graphics(Intel HD 3000) handle office work with ease and increase battery life and decrease heat versus the AMD card. I usually see 5+ hours web browsing, and I know I could see more than that by turning down the keyboard backlight and display brightness. The trackpad gestures make scrolling and backtracking through content easy, as well as allowing better window management than Windows(imagine that!).I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a powerful everyday notebook, that's light enough to carry everyday, but without Microsoft's Windows annoyances(popup alerts, scamware, antivirus updates).::Aaron J Smith::5.0::May 14, 2013
R2SWORLSYQXC0Q::Hey It's a mac!::Got this mac as a warehouse deal, a year ago, it was advertised as "like new" and hell, it was NEW IN A BOX!It was a super deal, and I have been using it since then.It's a mac, so what can I say. No nonsense computer. SUPER QUALITY construction. FAST enough for almost everything. No virus. No maintenance. I will never go back to Windows...::David Falcon::5.0::May 8, 2013
R1XSHKSH41AUCT::It's a MAC, what else is there to say??::As always, my Apple products that I purchase far exceed my expectations. This is now my third Mac I have purchased in the past two years, and will continue to buy Apple products. Amazing company, best warranty in the business, and they don't break down or get viruses like a Windows based computer....Need I say more? Spend the extra $$ and get the Mac!::50BMG Shooter::5.0::March 19, 2012

R8HYLXIDG8RSF::Amazing::I'd been wanting a MacBook for quite some time, but never actually had the cash nor desire to dish out $1,800 for a laptop. I'm glad I had a change of heart. I've been using a PC all my life, and haven't really used a Mac besides the giant blue desktops in 7th grade. I'm still trying to get used to everything, but the Mac OS is making it pretty easy. It's the little things that matter. You honestly don't realize how much extra nonsense you go through with a PC until you buy a Mac. The best way to explain the difference would be comparing someone, like me, who switched from a droid/blackberry to an iPhone. It's incredibly intuitive, user friendly, aesthetically appealing and just works. I admit, I still think they could be a little cheaper, but I'm a big "get-what-you-pay-for" kind of person. If you're looking for a laptop for gaming, look elsewhere. The app store has some great games at good prices, but you can get a much better gaming PC for a lot cheaper. As for everything else, I'd recommend a Mac to anyone. If you can get past the initial cost, you won't be sorry.::Xavier Hernandez::5.0::February 10, 2012
R2YYLMI5W04U3R::I'm in LOVE!::This Mac is great.  So easy to use, bright beautiful monitor. Great programs. So user friendly. If only Apple would start manufacturing them in America, it would be perfect.::E. Bantera::5.0::February 6, 2012
R3TMGW3RQNV3LB::really impressive::My previous MacBook Pro was stolen, but after two years it looked brand new in both look and performance, so I bought a new one.The hardware is high-level, the ease of use is really a major point (most of all the touchpad).Also, included applications like Garage Band and iMovie are great!If I have to find a weak point: the two USB slots are very close to each other: if you insert a pen-drive, not sure you may insert something in the second slot.::paolomalagoli::4.0::December 30, 2011
R2IGU61ELKKGPN::Where have you been all my life!!!!!::Let me say... I have been using a pc since DOS and Windows 3.1.  I think I have used almost every version since.  Just a bit of trivia, my first upgrade was from 4MB of RAM to 8MB and it cost me $400.I am slowly getting more and more use to my Mac.  I was not eligible for an upgrade for my internet access until this week, so my Mac was just a laptop for the past month, which was ok, I needed the time to more and more familiar with it Apple MacBook Pro MD318LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION).  These past few days though have been the most wonderful experience.  The internet is a totally different experience and I love it. The graphics are amazing, the speed, connectivity, it just seems more intuitive of what I want to accomplish.  To anyone thinking about switching over, do your homework first and make your decision.::Dom::5.0::December 10, 2011
R1KX4NJRUHCKQR::End of an era::Let me explain the title.Later this year, Apple will probably be replacing the current Macbook Pros with a machine more similar to the airs, no more optical drives, no native ethernet port and so on. So I decided to get this machine before they are gone for good. I have a 2008 Macbook unibody (the last model before they were called pros), and it has worked like a charm from day one, but it is getting older and will be used as a backup machine now that I have this one.I'm not going to get into the Apple/PC battle in this review, if you don't like Apple products, don't buy them. That will be all I will say on the matter.Now for this machine, I ordered a Seagate Momentus XT drive from newegg.com item #N82E16822148837. It is a 7200 rpm, 32 MB Cache, 6.0 Gb/s, Solid State Hybrid drive.(Check the reviews). I also ordered Corsair 16 Gb DDR3 1333 (PC3 10600) item #N82E16820233251. I got the machine and immediately switched out the ram and hard drive with the above mentioned items. After that, I turned the machine on, held command R, booted the computer from Apple's servers, restored from my Time Capsule backups, and I was in business. The ram was recognized, the hard drive is running like a charm. I now have a quad core proceesor, 16 Gb of ram and a hard drive that is almost as fast as an SSD, but with the the storage capacity of a traditional HDD. I am very happy with this machine and it should serve me for many years to come. BTW, I took the hard drive that came out of this machine and put it in my old Macbook, which only had a 250 Gb HDD, everything is working well. On a personal note, BACK UP YOUR HARD DRIVE. You can either use the Time Machine program that comes with your machine, or a free program called Super Duper, which clones you HDD. Your life will be soooo much easier if you back up your information. This machine is like any other multiple component machine, you may get a bad component from time to time, that should not make you hate the whole machine. I hope this review helps someone and gives them some useful information and ideas. Before you try anything to modify your machine, please research before you attempt to do it.::Mark D.

R1UCUXVCJ6LZ6J::Excellent Machine - I Don't Miss Windows AT ALL::Being in the IT field, I've used Windows for the last 20+ years and I wish I could get back all of the time I wasted troubleshooting problems with drivers, updates, viruses, BIOS, hardware, program installations, CODECs, it goes on and on...I would probably add a few years to my life. I am so fed up with Windows. I'm tired of trying to play a video file and getting "codec blah, blah, blah required" or the good old "not responding" messages. I want to turn something on, have it come up quickly and work and that is what you get with this machine. It allows you to be much more productive. Many reviews list specs, pros and cons. I love everything about this machine.  The performance, the look, feel, display, OS, utilities, apps, and keyboard are great. The only small issue is that it gets a little hot. It doesn't belong on a lap. I guess that's why it's not called a laptop. It is not cheap but if you use a computer all of the time, IMHO it is worth it. I enjoy using it everyday. Why not make your daily experience as good as it can be?::Joseph Nocella::5.0::July 13, 2012

R2DTYX3DNZX930::Hi I am a Mac::I have been a windows fan since I was introduced to the computer. I never wanted to get into the Apple bandwagon so I went ahead and bought the HP Envy top og the line laptop and I was disappointed. The only good thing about HP was the return process which was quick and easy. I decided to try the Mac and I am glad I did. What a product, what an experience. I am so in love with the machine. Everything just works in perfect harmony. So if you are in two minds about PC vs Mac, take my advice don't waste you time.::Amit Tikoo::5.0::May 4, 2012

I upgraded the memory for him to 8GB and the computer is just unbelievable. It is so fast, it is just a joy to use. I would recommend though getting a Zagg invisibleSHIELD for MacBook Pro 15-Inch SD Slot, Full Body (APPMBP3FB) because the aluminum does get scratched pretty easily.

I love the MacBook Pro. It looks great, preforms wonderfully and is totally user friendly. I was replacing an 8 year old PC and it is like comparing a Rambler to a Lexus. The learning curve was minimal, and I am still finding all kinds of bells and whistles that come on the Apple. I will never go back to a PC. An added bonus - I don't have to deal with viruses.::Kathy Poplawski::5.0::April 22, 2012

R2IM1G7Z8E5LW4::A Decent at best laptop::We get a laptop with school. Our selection is the 15 inch Mackbook Pro. Its the latest and greatest version. Overall it isnt bad, its just a laptop that happens to run Max OSX. I was never a really big fan of Macs mainly due to they charge more then what it would cost to build it better as a IBM Compatible. So lets get down to the nitty gritty.Pros, figure it like any other laptop other then it runs apples OSX. Which mind you is not your only option, you can dual boot to windows if you want, which I do. Excellent picture quality. Its slim and light weight.The Cons, I can be really picky here but will just put in the majors. Battery life is not even in the same zip code as they claim it should be misrepresentation for an out right lie on Apples part. It gets hot and I mean really hot if you run it with any kind of a workload. So you will need a laptop cooler that blows directly on the bottom of the case. You also get hit with Apples proprietary hardware ripoffs. Anything and I mean ANYTHING you want to do will require an apple product and it will cost you an arm and a leg. DO NOT buy from any apple to mac specialty store. Amazon sells it for about a fifth of what they want. I run my laptop through my widescreen monitor, apple wants 30 bucks for the adapter I got it off amazon for 6 bucks.I could REALLY pick it apart but will go gentle on it it is reliable and does good for 3d work. But if given a choice I would have picked an IBM compatible over a mac without even thinking about it.Wish I could give it half a star would be two and a half, I am not impressed for the insanely over price they are asking. Pick an windows laptop for one third the price and do the same job. I just didnt get a choice with it being the schools laptop of choice. So save your money and buy three Dell Laptops for what this cost you.::Ice-Child::3.0::March 2, 2012

R1SK0BY33MREK4::Save your money - Wish I could make this zero stars::After a career of using Microsoft I switched to Apple products, this proved to be the worst choice ever! They pressure you into their "care plans " And then when you need their help in store if you're five minutes late for your appointment they cancel you. And when you're in their facility asking for help there constantly looking at their watch because apparently they must have a time limit for how long they can work with you as you learn their tools. These are facts cause if you buy the product you will find out for yourself. And The facial recognition of the photos software, don't let them kid you it does not work unless every single star in the universe aligns. After seven months of using this product, their lack of customer service, their lack of in-house customer service, Yet their success of a highly overpriced product, I highly encourage you to save your money because the hype of their products far exceeds the quality. Take it from a successful leader in business this is why we never use these in our Fortune 100 company.::J Swanson::1.0::November 27, 2012
R2284SJ7VRZI61::Great product.....only one dissappointment::Having ordered this recently I was quite eager to get my hands on this. Got the package today only to realise there are no installation disks in the box!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm quite dissapointed by that. Now I've got to go through the hassle of contacting Amazon to let them send the installation disk. How am I to prove that the disks did not come in the box?????? I'm a bit angry actually!::Grano::4.0::November 25, 2011

R27SJ0NVY88NUW::refurbed laptop failed within 24 hours of receipt.::I bought my first macbook pro within the last 2 weeks directly through Apple via phone call.  It was refurbed, but I still spent over $2200, including software.  Within 24 hours of receipt the optical drive failed!!  Also when I ran the first system update, before optical drive failure, I rebooted the system and then the OS froze up on me and I had to do a hard reboot.  I called apple and they tell me to take it to the store for repairs!  Another tech tells me that it may have to do with a conflict w/the update.  For $2000+ it should have worked PERFECTLY!I returned the machine for a full refund and I was very unimpressed with their service and product.  I bought a ~$469 samsung tablet that I hope will last me at least 24 hours before failing... I would give the macbook pro a 0 if I could.Also I resent the term genius being used so loosely.  I find it insulting to my intelligence, almost as insulting as I find their overpriced junky machines.  Now I laugh when I see my classmates lugging one around.  You can keep your rotten apples!!::Sultan_Smokey_the_First::1.0::June 1, 2012
R29XD782J8FVNO::only because I can't give it a ZERO::This computer lasted me a total of four months before the hard drive crashed and over 5000 pictures were not recoverable. I found the staff at the Apple store (self proclaimed "geniuses") to be arrogant, useless and quite indifferent to you once they have your money. I called customer care and I guess this attitude is company policy. I would have to say I rate this company as despicable. Needless to say I will never buy another Apple product. I'll save 65% of my money next time and get a product that will last at least 3 years.::R. Schweitzer "Bobo214"::1.0::January 3, 2012

R2R2CMAII70J0I::Overrated.::The edges of the laptop cuts my wrists, and the laptop itself runs very hot when bootcamping Windows 7 or running anything semi-intensive on the Mac OS. The Mac OS also crashed upon using bootcamp to install Windows 7 (I had to re-install the entire Mac OS). I was recommended Macbooks for being the best Windows laptops (even though I did not purchase it for that reason entirely), however this is very far from the truth.Most users of these Macbooks will not tell you the serious heating issues these laptops bring. It is almost required to download a fan manager for your mac because it is believed that the manufacturers did not set the speeds appropriately. However, the downside to raising the speed of your fan is that you're degrading the integrity of your system greatly.The monitor has serious glare issues and is set so low on the Macbook it can cause neck pains for anyone at 6-foot.Also, these laptops are NOT durable by any means. I have scratches all over mine from just placing it into my bag. And please do not pick it up with a cd/dvd inside the system, else you can very easily get it stuck. Not to mention knock the alignment off of your hard-drive (done it countless times and froze the OS).The keyboard feels cheaply made. The keys are flimsy and takes some time getting used to.The macbook also comes with a very small amount of peripherals. No SD card slot, HDMI, VGA, and lack of any ability to get a bluray player into it. Also, the USB slots are terribly placed (some USB components will block the other USB ports).The Macbooks sacrifice their comfort for looking pretty. And to be honest, I rather have my computer be comfortable and work as a tool for my advantage, than to make it look pretty. Maybe you have to be a metrosexual man to get into this brand, I don't know...There are many more dependable and less expensive brands out there that would meet the needs of everyone who is good with their money (Lenovo, Sager, etc.).::Christopher R. Jenkins::1.0::December 7, 2011
R1K788QQH6GM9Q::Worst Mac EVER::Putting it honestly, I hate everything about this computer. I've used macs since 1988. The is the worst one ever. Speed is slow, apps (even native apple ones) constantly crash. Apple went in the wrong direction. My next computer will be a PC.::B. Putnam "Brett Putnam"::1.0::December 9, 2011
R209LJ1R9S3LVK::A year and 3 months...crash!::Four times the cost of a cheap PC, and it crashes after 15 months.  Of course, out of warranty.  Had to take it to an Apple store an hour and a half away from home.  Cost me the price of a cheap PC to fix it, not including gas back and forth twice.  Lesson?  Buy a cheap PC.Update:  2 months later, the Apple Store fix didn't last and have to drive another hour and a half for another proposed fix.  Back and forth, for a total of 6 hours each time (there and back to drop off, there and back to pick up)...so am now into 12 hours of drive time to have this machine fixed.Don't do it!  Buy a PC!::Badgerboy::1.0::March 23, 2013
R33TEITAY3VGP6::Worth the price::After considering many lower cost PC options, I went with the MacBook.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Overall design factors include a superior track pad interface, solid construction, back-lit keyboard, superior OS, terrific display, etc.  There are some higher end PC notebook solutions available but the cost difference really isn't that much between these solutions and the MacBook.  You get what you pay for and them some with this MacBook.I have no need to use an external mouse with this notebook due to an inferior track-pad interface found on most PC notebooks.  I have observed that the mouse pointer will jump around at times on PC notebooks due to sensitivity issues.  Other reviewers have observed the same behavior. This is likely due to the sensing of the palm by the track-pad.  Additionally, the track-pad on the PC solutions is often too small.  Often, these solutions need to include at least two buttons for left and right clicking and sometimes four just to accommodate users who are accustom to using buttons on the top or bottom of the track-pad.  The track-pad on the MacBook is a button itself and that is all that is needed.  Apple in effect is telling users to evolve and you will be better off.One thing worth noting about the MacBook is it does have sharp edges.  This allows the notebook to close such that there is no gap around the perimeter of the notebook.  However, if you are a user that rests your wrists on the notebook while typing instead of letting them float above the keypad, you will get many creases on your wrists and will likely feel some irritation.  This may ultimately result in more significant wrist injuries. When I first started using this notebook, my wrists did exhibit these creases so I adjusted my typing position by floating my hands above the keyboard as recommended.  Problem solved!  Apple design engineers are in effect saying "learn to type correctly."  Additionally, I purchased the following item to place the MacBook in a slanted orientation.  It also helps with heat dissipation and is very portable.  Having the notebook in the slanted orientation will also fix the issue with the sharp edges if you insist on not floating your hands above the keyboard while typing. I highly recommend it:Hercules X-Stand Ergonomic Portable Natural Airflow Cooling Stand For all 12-17" Laptop / Notebook ComputersI decided to go with the 1680 x 1050 display rather than the lower resolution display.  I believe that this is definitely worth the extra money.  Additionally, I considered the matte screen to mitigate the effects of screen reflections but ultimately decided to go with the glossy screen due to its vibrancy.  There can be issues with reflections so if you are a user that has a window directly behind you or work in an environment that has bright lights, you may want to opt for the matte screen. Reflections have not been an issue for me.  I recommend the glossy screen for most users.My system has 8 Gig of RAM.  Running a few applications will eat up memory fairly quickly.  Once memory runs low, the OS will need to swap memory to the hard disk thus compromising performance.  According to Apple, use of RAM that is not exactly the same as what is specified (same specs and manufacture) will void the warranty.  You may want to consider that if you are looking at the possibility of adding your own RAM which you can do for significantly less than what Apple charges which is $200 for 4 Gig more than the base model which has 4 Gig of RAM itself.  Contact Apple first if you have any doubts about such warranty issues.In summary,  all of the components of the MacBook are integrated so well with the OS that it is truly the superior solution. This is simply because Apple has virtually complete control of the OS and hardware.  Without going into the technical details here, this makes a huge difference when compared to solutions based on Windows that need to accommodate multiple hardware platforms from many notebook manufactures.::Gerald::5.0::February 6, 2012
R5NUQGHW7JP7D::Excellent laptop - Long time mac user::I was little concern about the battery and heat before my purchase because all reports that has been posted on the internet. I finally received this new macbook pro 2.2Ghz and after few days I can tell this is an excellent computer.The computer doesn't overheat running light stuff like Safari, iTunes, Spotify, etc.. so It is running OK for me.About the battery, yes, it is true.. I can get round 3 o 4 hours depending of my use. I installed gfxCardStatus to force the HD3000 when running on battery and it has improved it a little bit.Compared to my previous macbook pro (old 2007 Santa Rosa), The only thing I miss is the keyboard of my old computer; this one feels "cheap", but you'll get use to it after few days.I would definitely buy it again; the computer is extremely fast; I only need to buy a SSD to make it the even better.::Yolanda::5.0::December 8, 2011
R2RJYULD5MVMJU::Love the computer, but...::I purchased the MacBook Pro 15.4" laptop on Amazon and was delighted to receive it promptly. It came in exactly the same beautiful packaging as it would have had I picked it up directly from the Apple Store, BUT... I discovered that since I did not purchase it directly from the Apple Store, that I could not purchase One-to-One Apple Support. Apparently, Apple does not offer that service unless you buy your computer from their store, even if you purchase from an authorized reseller, like Amazon. This was disappointing to me.::dianaleona::4.0::March 12, 2012
R2KOT5HYQ4DYEL::Not an affordable computer, but worth the money!::I've had a few computers in the past, two desktops and one laptop and all were running windows. The last computer I purchased was a 2000 dollar Alienware M17x, I paid that much money for quality just like I paid 1700 for this Macbook Pro. While my Alienware cost more money than this macbook, it is incompetent to this computer. This macbook had an amazing build quality, in comparison the Alienware had poor low quality plastic build and was very bulky. This computer is fast and powerful and can do every task my alienware could do, but better.If you have the money for this computer, you won't regret it especially if you are looking to pay for quality.::Aaron::5.0::January 13, 2012
R2K3EWKCKYDD5D::Great Laptop but...::This is a great laptop first of all. The trackpad and battery are such great conveniences especially since I'm using mine for college. It looks great, runs great, and EXCELLENT customer service from Apple.Alright I've spent 30 minutes trying to think of other things that I like about this laptop. Now here's the thing, it's probably just me, but I don't see anything that makes this laptop better than a PC. My main reason of getting this laptop was to see how great it was, since everyone was talking about it, and recommending it to me. I've had it for 4 months now, and I have no clear idea of how it could beat a laptop that's half its price. I love playing Starcraft 2, but I have to run it on the lowest settings, while my PC with the same specifications can run it on high. So either right now, there's nothing different, or I'm not utilizing my Macbook Pro to its fullest potential. If I am, someone please comment so I could get a better experience with this.Don't get me wrong, it's still a great laptop, and I love the thing, but I do regret switching. I swear I'm not a troll looking to start a PC vs Mac war, I just want to state my opinions, and hopefully someone tells me whether I'm wrong or right with a reason why.EDIT: Let's make this clear, I didn't buy this laptop for gaming. I bought it mainly based on recommendations, battery life, and durability.Thanks Nathan and Geib, I just ordered the 8 GB RAM, and it should be here soon. I don't think I would've searched for them since, I didn't think they'd be that cheap (well... not cheap, but a low price compared to what I was thinking haha).As for viruses, I never got them with my PC, but it's nice to know that it's not just luck that I'm not getting them lol.::Nathan::5.0::November 20, 2011

RXFIB9MXVBW2P::Very nice product but once put to use, didn't like.::I bought the Macbook Pro in order to make a move from the Windows world in which I had Windows Vista.  I was very surprised on how well the product was designed and the pleasure one gets just looking at it, its by far the best looking laptop out there, but once I started using it became apparent that I was in for a surprise.  I know a little more than the average user about computers and will let you know the pros and cons as I experienced them.Pros- Best laptop design out there. Very nice Aluminum design.- Very Good battery life.  Once the brightness is adjusted to auto.- Best trackpad i've ever used.  It can recognized whether I have 3 fingers on it or just one.  Great.- Backlit keyboard.  Very nice and it turns on automatically depending on light.- Great Webcam.  The webcam is great, very nice resolution.- Solid State Drive.  I payed extra for it but its definately worth it.Semi-consThese Semi cons are because of the awesome design.- Only 2 usb ports.- No additional battery support or interchangable for that matter. The battery is good but not infinite, need more juice.- Can't support mini discs but then again barely anyone uses those, but I mention it because I bought a amplified wifi adaptor that brought one and had to save the drivers on hd first.CONS (hardware)Where do I start there are so many cons that I will just focus on the ones that affected me directly.- No Bluray drive.  I have a PS3, tons of blurays and couldn't take any of my movies with me on the road.- No USB 3.0 support.  I bought a hard drive that is usb 3.0 but couldnt take advantage of the speed.  I have an internal SSD and the speed would've helped.- No HDMI built in. I had to buy a separate adaptor for it, this is a con because I payed $2200 for my Mac and I didn't want to spend more money.- The fan kept coming on when I was running Parallels in order to use much needed Windows features (read the other cons to know why).  A laptop fan helped ease that but I noticed the Aluminum was coming back to bite me on this one as it was loud.CONS (software)This is where I don't like this machine. At first it seemed I didn't need anything else and I would be able to do everything, but then it became apparent that I would be needing a lot.- No NTFS write support.  I found myself trying to copy things into my old hard drive and couldn't do it.  I would drag files to it and they wouldn't drop, no warning, nothing.  I did some research and found out that you can't do that without buying software.  At least Mac OS should let you know it's not supported, instead they choose not to let you know. Linux even supports this.- No games.  No games worth playing are available for the MacOS, I wanted to play some games on my down time and was surprised as to the games that are actually available.- Lack of software.  If I wanted to find a software for whatever it may be, all I had to do was search and I was almost guaranteed to find it for windows, with the Mac is kind of a surprise, "like wow it's on the Mac too, sweet".  Windows would be needed for lots of business programs.- Quicktime player.  I was wondering exactly what does Quicktime support and basically 2 file formats which didn't work for me since most of my stuff is in Divx and WMV.  I had to download VLC.  The main reason why this is a CON is because i shouldn't have to download a tool for every little thing I want to do.- Using Windows.  This is a con because Apple sells their operating system as the most advance but yet feel the need to include bootcamp so you can put Windows.  I don't get it but there are even companies that sell software so you can run windows within Mac OS which clearly fixes a lot of problems with Mac, but it shouldn't come down to that.  Windows doesn't support you to use MAC OS (even though Apple makes it illegal) or linux for that matter and i'm not talking about dual boot or virtual machines, I'm talking about using them at the same time like with Fusion or Parallels (virtual but integrates windows with Mac OS). The way I feel is that if you say your operating system is the best you shouldn't include a way to use the inferior one.  Obviously Mac OS lost points with me on that one, basically saying that they lack features and you should use Windows.- No customization.  You basically can't customize anything and I mean anything. its hard to find programs on there also, if you dont have them on the dock.The list can go on but these were things that bothered me and when you factor in price, this is not the best thing I couldve done for $2200 plus all the software.It looks nice but in the end falls short to live up to the hype of replacing a windows machine for the more advanced user.  I need the ability to own the system and customise it however I please.  In the end I decided to go back to a Windows 7  machine which can do anything Lion can do and much much more.  One of the main selling points was the lack of viruses for Mac, but I noticed that if you don't go looking around the internet for free stuff from shady sites or clicking spam, you shouldn't even need anti-virus for your Mac or PC.  Windows PCs are bigger targets due to more than 90 percent of the computers out there.I went back to the Apple store to return the product and they tried selling me on keeping it by telling me it can do all this stuff but once I started asking the hard questions I started getting "it's a Mac" from the salesperson, like I was supposed to forget about what I use a computer for and keep cause "mac is cool".  In my research the only thing that a Mac can do that a windows machine can't is run Apple made software like Final Cut Pro.  It became apparent at the Apple store that the main feature it offers is the ability to run Windows.I didn't like the product and hope my review will be able to educate someone on the fence on whether it is worth the price.  People will disagree with my review I'm sure but I have wrote the honest truth and no one can argue with the facts.  In the commercials Apple makes it sound like it's the most advanced thing ever and in the end maybe its too advance, coming from the future where no one uses Bluray, USB 3.0 or does actual work on their computers just surf the web and spend hours of time building ficticious farms.Thanks.Final word: Audi talks trash on BMW but doesn't feel the need to include a way to use a BMW engine in their cars.  Apple clearly knows that windows is better and it shows on them adding a way to use Windows but at the same time saying it sucks.::Joel::2.0::February 21, 2012
R10U6H4SURPTUZ::Great Service!::I love the computer, but knew I would.  I had problems registering it with Apple, but the seller, was very supportive and provided me all of the documentation that I needed to get the issue resolved.Would definitely buy from them again!  The computer is exactly what I wanted... a brand new "older version" MacBook Pro with the built in DVD.::BGK::5.0::May 19, 2014
R74MXY4RDGGBI::15" MacBook Pro is a keeper::I've had a lot of MacBooks(6+) and this is the one I've decided to keep. I swapped the HD for a Samsung 830 SSD and everything loads so fast, it's like using an iPad or iPhone. The resolution is a little low, but colors are vibrant and the workspace is acceptable for writing and webpage viewing. The speakers sound great for such a thin laptop, with vibrant warm sound. The video card (AMD 6750m) lets you play games such as Diablo 3 at native resolution and high details, while the integrated graphics(Intel HD 3000) handle office work with ease and increase battery life and decrease heat versus the AMD card. I usually see 5+ hours web browsing, and I know I could see more than that by turning down the keyboard backlight and display brightness. The trackpad gestures make scrolling and backtracking through content easy, as well as allowing better window management than Windows(imagine that!).I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a powerful everyday notebook, that's light enough to carry everyday, but without Microsoft's Windows annoyances(popup alerts, scamware, antivirus updates).::Aaron J Smith::5.0::May 14, 2013

R2PC84UHBEI1TJ::It works flawlessly::The main thing about apple products is that they work. With this laptop ANY operating system you care to run is available to you...multiple OS at the same time with the addition of a software product like Parallels.

R3LZJU1RTJFFVU::Fantastic machine, shame about the hard drive and battery life::The macbook pro is almost everything I hoped for.  Great design quality and screen.  Very comfortable keyboard, and OS X mostly just works.  There are a few annoyances though:1. The fan kicks in and is very loud under relatively little load.  This doesn't seem to be unique to my laptop, my coworkers who own the same model report the same issue.  Unfortunately, it is so loud it can be heard when talking to someone on the phone by the person at the other end.2.  The battery life is terrible.  2-3 hours max.  Again, not unique to my laptop.  It's more of a portable desktop than something that can be used unplugged.3.  The hard drive performance is terrible.  IU don't recall my intel mac mini being dog slow.  As my macbook has 16GB RAM and there was nothing else running this is disk related.  After about 6 months of frustration at an awesome machine being crippled by the disk I upgraded to a WD Scorpion Black a couple of days ago.  Night and day difference.I'd certainly buy another macbook pro, it's a great machine.::Jonathan::4.0::May 25, 2013

R1T4W0OBL1FGC6::Best purchase of my life::I've owned my MBP 15" for almost a year now, and I think it's the most expensive and best technology investment I've ever made. As a college student, the sticker shock blew me away, but I decided to buy it anyways. Now I am a very satisfied owner, I've used my laptop about six hours a day average probably, all my classes are online and I love computer games. Since my purchase, I've upgraded my MacBook by replacing the factory default 4GB of memory with 8GB, and I've replaced the Superdrive with an SSD (Note: like many other 8,2 models, there's a problem where the computer's dvd bay doesn't actually work with the 6GB/S SATA standard, thus the bay actually holds the old hard drive, and the SSD is in the hard drive bay) and everything (Including TRIM support) has worked flawlessly. I was honestly amazed at how simple it is to upgrade this laptop. It's very ergonomic, the screen is beautiful, it's very comfortable to type on. I love the adjustable screen brightness, as well as adjustable keyboard backlighting, and the switchable dual graphics cards. It's not hard to squeeze hours of battery life out of this computer (especially when you download GFX status, a tiny program that lets you choose which graphics card to use instead of letting mac OSX pick for you). The graphics card is decently powerful, I'm pretty into video gaming and this thing definitely plays most games at medium settings, but keep in mind it's not a gaming laptop, and especially not a gaming desktop. Installing Windows 7 is a breeze (though you lose some of the features, like switchable graphics cards). I think it's very portable (I carry it on me constantly, even if I don't think I'll need it that day). I only really have two complaints:1) with an EFI/UEFI boot system, apple seems to have done everything they possibly can to make it tough as nails to install a new operating system (I'm talking about Linux of course), though this is the case with every Mac and isn't specific to this laptop2) I use WINE a lot to play PC games on my macbook, but the fact that it has an AMD graphics card and not an NVIDIA makes it a lot harder, since NVIDIA has much better drivers (for the other 95% of you this won't make a difference, the graphics card is great, it's just not NVIDIA). This is also annoying when using UNIX because the AMD drivers tend to be pretty crappy compared to the NVIDIA ones.Now for the surprising part: If I went back and made the decision again, I wouldn't buy this laptop. I think the 15" screen is great, but I would definitely have like having the 17" model more I think. Of course, since they're almost identical I guess it's not that surprising::Johan::5.0::February 19, 2013

RBO33RS6UW2DV::Great Condition, Amazing Shipping::The laptop was shipped out in less than 24 hours from when purchased and got here within a few days.  The condition was pretty much perfect except for a minor scratch on the bottom and one more on the back.  Overall I would say I'm very pleased with everything and especially the price.::PJ::5.0::August 1, 2012
R3LN5IPLJGZFLZ::A complete power house.::This is perfect time to start buying a MacBook Pro. Just like the stock market this is a buying time for this product. The new ones are so over priced and over powered that you don't all that power unless your in an industry that demands it. This laptop does everything I need and more. I have also modified it to have two hard drives and run two operating systems. The iCore 7 dishes out anything I throw at and the 8gb of RAM supports it. When I modded my Mac I added an SSD drive which just made it just as good as those over priced new ones. This model is a early 2011 and its byfar still top of the line. And yes you can game with it.The video card in these Mac's are perfect for some mid-range gaming. You might get away with playing Crysis2 if you set it up right. This is my first Mac and I know it will last me a long time. Make sure you look for a used one in good condition and communicate with the seller so that you know what you are getting into. Once again, if you have always been in the market for a Mac, now is the time. Look for someone that is trying to get ride of their current one for a new one. They have no idea how much money they are really throwing away. For a regular PC owner these Macs' will last you a long time.::J. Guzman "JAG"::5.0::July 29, 2012

Great service and product. I would've thought this laptop was brand new if I didn't know different. I had a few minor problems after receiving the product and the seller helped me out a lot.If you are having doubts on purchasing from this seller, take the plunge and you won't regret it.::Ktisten "KristenD"::5.0::July 26, 2012

R1UCUXVCJ6LZ6J::Excellent Machine - I Don't Miss Windows AT ALL::Being in the IT field, I've used Windows for the last 20+ years and I wish I could get back all of the time I wasted troubleshooting problems with drivers, updates, viruses, BIOS, hardware, program installations, CODECs, it goes on and on...I would probably add a few years to my life. I am so fed up with Windows. I'm tired of trying to play a video file and getting "codec blah, blah, blah required" or the good old "not responding" messages. I want to turn something on, have it come up quickly and work and that is what you get with this machine. It allows you to be much more productive. Many reviews list specs, pros and cons. I love everything about this machine.  The performance, the look, feel, display, OS, utilities, apps, and keyboard are great. The only small issue is that it gets a little hot. It doesn't belong on a lap. I guess that's why it's not called a laptop. It is not cheap but if you use a computer all of the time, IMHO it is worth it. I enjoy using it everyday. Why not make your daily experience as good as it can be?::Joseph Nocella::5.0::July 13, 2012

R2DTYX3DNZX930::Hi I am a Mac::I have been a windows fan since I was introduced to the computer. I never wanted to get into the Apple bandwagon so I went ahead and bought the HP Envy top og the line laptop and I was disappointed. The only good thing about HP was the return process which was quick and easy. I decided to try the Mac and I am glad I did. What a product, what an experience. I am so in love with the machine. Everything just works in perfect harmony. So if you are in two minds about PC vs Mac, take my advice don't waste you time.::Amit Tikoo::5.0::May 4, 2012

I love the MacBook Pro. It looks great, preforms wonderfully and is totally user friendly. I was replacing an 8 year old PC and it is like comparing a Rambler to a Lexus. The learning curve was minimal, and I am still finding all kinds of bells and whistles that come on the Apple. I will never go back to a PC. An added bonus - I don't have to deal with viruses.::Kathy Poplawski::5.0::April 22, 2012

R10W251BH50UZ1::breakdown in quality control::I've been a loyal Apple customer for years, but will never buy another product from this company. As has happened to so many other people (google it!), the charger started getting flaky and then just stopped working. Totally aggravating: you buy a $2k+ computer, and it is rendered unusable by a complete breakdown in quality control on a cheap piece of hardware. So, as aggravating as that is, OK, I'll need to buy a replacement. How much? EIGHTY (80) FREAKING AMERICAN DOLLARS! The absolute arrogance of this company, gouging us for THEIR mistake, charging $80 for something that can't possibly cost more than $5 to manufacture.Never again.::Jeanette Martin::1.0::February 7, 2013
R2WFG40R8P0ILI::Why waste your precious life on anything else?::With the countless hours I spend running my business while traveling, the MacBook pro 17" is a welcome treat. When I bought it I was expecting it to lag behind my iMac in speed--a fair trade off for the portability. But in all honesty, I think the MacBook is faster than my iMac. It's a professional machine that handles Final Cut Pro, Photoshop and many other CPU intensive applications.Tongue-in-cheek side note* To those thinking that it's not worth spending the extra cash to buy a MacBook vs a PC, ask yourselves this question: is your time, and therefor life, worth wasting on a machine that is buggy and poorly designed, and as such a constant headache to use? If your life isn't worth much or you are a sadist, buy a pc. If you value your time and want to enjoy as much of it as you can, including those times you spend working at your computer, buy a Mac. :p::Peter::5.0::April 26, 2012
RHPF1YSXIR2OA::Hardware problems - must have warante::Started out as a great product but after 1 year the power supply broke.  I looked this up and it's a common problem so another 90 bucks and shipping for a new one.Videos also started locking the machine after 1 year.  This gradually became worse to the point where I can't play any type of video now without locking up the machine and requiring a hard boot.  Research both of these problems and you'll realize that everyone with this machine experiences them.I read that it may cost around $700 to fix the video problem by re-gluing the video card to the board.  I don't want to spend another 700 for this thing.I guess the take-away here is that you must have the warante.::Stan::1.0::March 13, 2013
R730COO2K8QX7::Beats the heck out of newer Mac laptops::I'm still using my 2006 Mac Pro as my main computer, but it's showing its age. It won't upgrade to any newer Mac OS than Lion (10.7), so software that requires a newer OS doesn't work. I have a newer Mac Mini, but it's underpowered. The paucity of ports on newer MacBooks is a concern, and I'm of an age where tiny text on a tiny screen is unappealing.Though it's three years old, this laptop has plenty of punch, with an Intel i7 processor. Amazon's independent vendor was iPowerResale, who did a TERRIFIC job. I opted to swap out the optical drive into a separate USB enclosure, move the 750GB hard drive in its place, and install a 500GB solid state drive as the main drive. They upgraded memory to 8GB and installed Mavericks. This thing is ten pounds heavy but rugged and works like a dream. The battery lasts hours between charges, and the screen is a dream.::James Gagne "Jim Gagne"::5.0::May 20, 2014

R2QG7R6G1TICVZ::disappointed::I have had mostly good experiences with Laptops, and really wanted a macBook Pro. The build quality and the Apple reputation. First one I got the hard drive failed in 2 days. The second, the hard drive failed a week later. I never got a chance to do much with it. I have had a hard drive fail once on a dell a few years back, but nothing like this. I did not think the Apple customer service was any different than what I got elsewhere, if that, so I was not sure where all the hype comes from. So, I went back to HP and got an envy 17 with gobs of memory (16GB RAM) and 2 hardrives (one 300GB SSD) and 3D, a back lit keyboard, blueray drive, and i7 2860 for under $2400 with coupon code. This includes MS OFFICE small bussiness, ADOBE, 2 years Norton. Now I am as happy as I thought I would be with a MacPro 17.::ddier2::1.0::April 7, 2012
R6G791JVIBRJ4::Encroaching Obsolescence?::Bought this computer several months ago....Two complaints:  After the 1st 90 days, the caps lock worked fine IF you hit it a half dozen times OR pushed down very hard, and the cursor is very sensitive; I have "clicked" on the "wrong" thing countless times - usually with no consequence, but sometimes this has really been an annoyance....Perhaps it's me, but my last Macbook did not have these problems....I have found Apple to be less than helpful so I did not pursue my concerns with them...Other wise the computer is fine, though it has definitely started to slow down...Thank you.UPDATE May 18  2013:  To date, cap locks "feature" still requires several hits to activate....Really hate this, BUT the worst of all is the overly sensitive/responsive click that makes the cursor jump all over the place....I have tried to modulate this, but this still continues to be a huge pain (especially when accidentally choosing an option that I definitely did not want....) The good news is that, like all my prior Macs, it is beginning to die and should pass away at approx the three-year mark; right on time.  Is it really that unreasonable to ask that something this expensive could go for longer with pretty gentle use?::Voice of Zip::3.0::March 16, 2012

But when I received this laptop, it was much heavier than I expected it to be and It was very confusing to set up initially.  It kept forcing me through all these menus before I could use it.  I'm so used to the plug and play usability of most Apple products and I did not experience that with this laptop.  I eventually got so frustrated with it that I boxed it up and sent it back.  The seller was great and took it back without any arguments.I have not given up on owning a MacBook Pro, however, and may try again at a later date.::Lukeinashland::2.0::May 17, 2013

R1KGFCO0EQA6AO::Arrived broken, but Apple has great customer service::Originally, I was very frustrated with this product. It was not working correctly, and I was panicked thinking I had paid over $2,000 for a computer that was either not user-friendly, or (previously being a PC user and non-techie) I just wasn't technically inclined enough to use a Mac. Thankfully, I took my new MacBook Pro to the Apple Store (who has incredible customer service, but is over an hour away) and they will repair it.Amazon gets a 1 star for sending me a defective product. The hard drive was damaged. The product itself gets a 4 star. I worked on one at the Apple Store and was impressed. It made me very excited to see what my MacBook Pro should and will do. It could be upgraded to a 5, but I have yet to see what it is fully capable of.

R2B3ZDOLDK86Y5::New 13" MacBook Air vs. New 13" MacBook Pro: A side-by-side comparison::I purchased both the newly updated 13" MacBook Air and the updated 13" MacBook Pro the day they were announced at WWDC and released for sale in June 2012. After using the two machines side-by-side for a couple weeks now, I can say that the MacBook Air offers superior performance in virtually every respect to such a degree that I've pretty much stopped using my brand new MacBook Pro. Of course the Air (which I got factory upgraded to the 2.0 GHz i7 processor and 8GB of RAM) is lighter, slimmer, and sleeker than the Pro, and yes, it does have a much higher resolution display, but I was surprised just how much faster the MacBook Air is compared to the Pro is despite the Air's slower CPU clock speed. The SSD hard drive on the MacBook Air makes an enormous difference in everything from casual web browsing to video editing.Speed and Performance: Advantage MacBook AirApart from the hard drives and port configurations, the technology inside the machines is virtually identical in both the newly refreshed MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both Pros and Airs come with either i5 or i7 Intel "Ivy Bridge" processors, Intel HD Graphics 4000, USB 3.0, and lightning-fast Thunderbolt ports. While the MacBook Air models are at a disadvantage to the MacBook Pro models in terms of CPU clock speeds, any performance disadvantage from the processor speed is more than made up for by the lightning fast performance of the Air's SSD hard drive, which Apple markets as "Flash" storage. In everyday tasks from gaming to web browsing to watching Flash movies and editing video, the MacBook Air is faster significantly faster in virtually every task. The Air boots up in less than 12 seconds while the Pro takes upwards of one minute.Screen: Advantage MacBook AirOnce you get used to the super high resolution 1440 x 900 LED display on the MacBook Air, the 1280 x 800 back-lit LED display on the MacBook Pro looks downright grainy and primitive. Simply put, once you get used to a higher resolution display, the 1280 x 800 display on the 13" MacBook Pro just isn't acceptable. Even for simple tasks like email or word processing where you wouldn't think the resolution would matter, the graphics look grainy and pixelated, which just isn't acceptable for a pro-level laptop in 2012.Upgradability: Advantage MacBook ProOne major difference that's important to consider between the Air and the Pro is that the Pro is more flexible and adaptable in terms of upgradability. With only a screw driver and about 10 minutes of your time, you can add more memory to the Pro, replace the hard drive, and even add a second hard drive in place of the optical disc drive. The Air, on the other hand, is stuck in the configuration you purchase it in except that you can opt to replace the SSD "Flash" hard drive with a higher capacity drive. However, both the Air and Pro have USB 3.0 (which is five times faster than USB 2.0 and backward compatible) and Thunderbolt (which is ten times faster than USB 2.0), I see no reason to replace the Air's hard drive any time soon given how cheap external hard drives are and how fast the connection has become.Design, Weight, Portability, Battery Life, and Form Factor: Advantage MacBook AirThe MacBook Air is the most beautiful computer ever produced by man. The aluminum case is impeccably designed, almost tailored to accommodate the necessary internal components, while maintaining practical ergonomics. It's an incredibly thin, svelte, sexy little notebook. The aluminum case seems sturdy and durable, and its mechanics are very similar to the time-test unibody construction of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is a bit of a dinosaur in its bulky circa 2006 unibody. The Pro is heavier than a half gallon of milk at 4.5 lbs, while the MacBook Air weighs in at less than 2.9 lbs. Battery life is roughly even on both machines at anywhere from 4 to 7 hours depending on workload and settings.Summary Judgement: Buy the MacBook AirSimply put, the guts of the two machines are basically the same, but the Air's SSD hard drive gives it a tremendously significant boost in performance. Sadly, the MacBook Pro's 5400-rpm hard drive leaves the machine unable to capitalize on the newest, most expensive Intel "Ivy Bridge" i5 and i7 processors that you're paying a $300 premium for in the newly updated Pros. If you are going to buy a Pro, invest  the extra money and get it upgraded with a SSD hard drive and get an extra external hard drive if you need additional cheap storage space for multimedia files. When you also consider the superior display, lighter weight, increased portability, and lower price of the MacBook Air, it's hard to find a reason to justify purchasing the current 13" MacBook Pro, which to me looks like a dinosaur rapidly headed for extinction.Specs on the models compared:13" MacBook Air (mid 2012) factory upgraded to the 2.0 GHz dual core i7 processor and factory upgraded to 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM) with standard 256 GB SSD ("Flash") hard drive13" MacBook Pro (mid 2012) with 2.9 GHz dual core i7 processor, 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM), and 750GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpmBoth feature Intel HD 4000 Graphics, 3.0 USB, Thunderbolt, 802.11n, etc.::Farb Dannon::5.0::June 29, 2012
RXY11D94G6N5W::Portability and performance: a photographer's perspective::I am a professional photographer, and recently purchased the Macbook Air 13" base model as an addition to my desktop workstation. It replaced a 2010 13" Macbook Pro as the machine I'll use when away from the office. After a few days of testing, here are my thoughts:Processor: The one word response would be "sufficient." Overall, the beauty of this laptop is that it gets out to the way and simply lets you do what you need to do. The processor isn't the fastest on the market, but I have never been left waiting for any processing tasks to date. As an email access point, word processor, and internet browser there is more than enough processing power to have a boatload of applications and multiple tabs open without a stutter. Web pages scroll nicely, new programs open in a second or two and when it comes to productivity tasks this is night and day better than my iPad since I can actually use the keyboard, Microsoft Office etc. The processor doesn't need to be all that powerful in large part due to the flash memory storage, upgraded in this generation to the faster 6 Gb/s connection so that read/write processes don't drag the computer down at all. While I use my desktop for all of my heavy duty processing of images and HD video, I will occasionally need to process an image or two on the road. So far I have found that Photoshop CS5 runs very nicely on this model, with nearly instant effects utilizing simple layer/curves adjustments. Processor intensive tasks such a gaussian blur related filters have a slight lag, taking approximately 30% longer than they do on my i7 920 desktop processor that is a few years old. It all gets done though, is far faster than my previous laptop, and nothing I regularly do has taken more than 2-3 seconds of processing time for an image, totally acceptable. It's the 30-40 second drags from my prior laptop that made me ready to throw it out the window. However, the few seconds of slowing is enough that I wouldn't want to process thousands of photos on this laptop, but for the casual edit it is more than sufficient. Lightroom runs smoothly as well, in large part due to the cache being on SSD storage, so even my 5D MkIII raw files at 30MB each are rendered to a smaller jpeg preview that the lighter processor can handle and render quickly off the SSD. Imports/export rendering take longer on this machine to be sure, but by that time I'm off doing other errands so I don't mind this lag. Video editing is functional as well and would likely work for most casual users, but massive projects simply wouldn't be possible on this machine for a multitude of reasons ranging from storage space to video card, screen size, processor etc. Overall, it does handle all casual productivity tasks that I need faster than any laptop I've owned, and can handle more processor intensive image applications acceptably for a laptop, though not fast enough that I'd consider using this as a full time professional machine.Screen: The 13 inch model seems to be the perfect blend of portability and functionality for me. This particular screen is vibrant, and has the capability to professionally render the images that I need with a few caveats. Firstly, the factory set color profile for the screen looked good enough for basic use, but to my sensitive eyes had a bluish hue to it. Apple laptops are notoriously inaccurate for color rendition (increased contrast, saturation in reds and blues) so I would highly recommend that users who do much imaging work create a custom color profile their monitor. Even casual users are likely to be disappointed when actually printing images that look great on this screen (i.e. pumped up colors and contrast with a flat and lifeless print in real life). Also, for all of us that send files over the internet to Facebook/email etc, I would think it would be nice to know what your photos would look like "on average" to most of the users out there without a similar Mac screen. The "profile" utility built into OS X is worthless, and I'd recommend a software solution such as ColorEyes Display Pro, combined with a sensor such as the Spyder 4. I wish I could have assessed the default profile to find out how much it was off at baseline, but my software can only analyze custom profiles that it creates. Needless to say, things look a lot different after the profiling, and at 75% brightness I was able to get the monitor down to an average dE of 0.51 with a max dE of 2.99 in the greys (less than 1 is great accuracy, less than 5 is sort of standard to start professional work for me). I also notice that the edges of the screen on all sides have a very slight dark tinge/wave that extends for about half an inch. It is only faintly noticeable, shows up most against white backgrounds, and decreases with increased screen brightness. This isn't a defect unique to my unit, as it seems to affect all of the models at the Apple store that I went to see, as well as a few friends with Airs from years past. It would be nice if this screen were perfect, but it works and the minor screen variation doesn't effect the center working space of the image...so I think of it sort of like a built in vignette. This is a well documented complaint you can find on many forums with a quick internet search. If it's persisted into the 3rd generation of modern Air I don't see it going away soon. The resolution is also acceptable and a noted improvement over the 13" standard Macbook pro. Not retina, but the graphics on this model couldn't handle that resolution anyways. Retina display on the Macbook air will be a welcome addition in the years to come when the technology to scale everything down at a reasonable cost becomes feasible. Till then, this does the trick.Battery life: one of my most important considerations for a laptop. This computer consistently achieves 7hrs of battery life as advertised. Screen brightness can be set to a custom level for increased battery life but I have yet to beat 7.5hrs. Surprisingly, Wifi intensive tasks such as downloading large files seem to have the biggest impact on battery life. I'd love to have a 10hr laptop at some point, but this model can get me through a busy work day every time so long as I start with a fully charged battery before.Value/Upgrades: I am happy with the 128GB base model with 4GB ram, and made that decision mainly based on the value offered by the Apple upgrades. First off, with the base processor, all of my tasks seem to fly along with the exception of major processing such as photo or video exporting after edits. The i7 2.0 GHz upgrade would only be of marginal help, with the advantage of the "turbo boost" performance at 3.2 GHz versus 2.8 or a 11-14% increase for $100 (but requiring the $300 memory upgrade as well). I seriously considered the 8GB of ram as well, as the $100 upgrade would help to future proof the computer's performance. The problem with this, or any other upgrade over the stock base model is that you need to purchase the custom Air models directly from Apple, without the Amazon discount, with the added sales tax and recycling fee. That's an additional $150 or so in immediate outlay for privilege of even beginning to customize the computer at an additional price (or about $250 extra for 8GB of ram rather than the initially apparent $100 which would have been worth it). I have found that most Mac laptops depreciate at about 10-15% per year from the base price (any additional cost to tax etc is thrown out immediately), so selling this computer in a year or two to stay current with technology is by far the better value for me.Regarding space, I have all of my programs (Lightroom, Office, Photoshop and a few others) on the 128GB drive with 95GB to spare. That's a lot of extra space for working files so long as they aren't media based. For that, you would need an external drive either way, as a day of photography can produce 60-70GB, and video can get into the hundreds of GB quickly, nothing that the minor 128GB upgrade would cover. The USB3 connection and a 7200RPM external drive does a great job, and ensuring that Photoshop etc are using the onboard flash storage as a scratch disk makes for great performance without compromise. Also, for storage in a pinch, the SD card slot provides an opportunity for a cheap upgrade. A 64GB SD card just barely sticks out of the side and can be had for $50 or so, while a 128GB SD card costs ~$150 with prices dropping fast. These won't have anywhere near the same read write speeds as built in memory, but would be more than sufficient for music, document, image storage etc when needed.Overall, I'm thrilled with this machine and would recommend it without hesitation. I thought briefly about the new Retina Macbook Pro, since I could find many uses for the extra resolution and processing power. However, I ultimately decided to use this machine for its exceptional value and extra portability. The rMBP is a beautiful machine, but even with its performance it isn't close to a modern desktop machine of similar pricing equipped an i7 3770 processor, SSD boot and scratch drive, GTX 670 or similar, 16GB ram and a nice 24" dual monitor setup all for the same 2k price tag. So I'll take this with me on the road or the coffee shop, and save the serious work for my desktop with multiple monitors etc. No computer can be everything for everybody, but this Air is surprisingly versatile and ranges between best in class and acceptable for everything I've thrown at it. I'm a big fan.::Noah::5.0::July 12, 2012
R10KKPM7BQTDU9::No longer the undisputed champion of the ultrabook sector, but still the odds-on favorite.::UPDATES:1/6/13 - 3 months in, and still going strong. Picked up Applecare about a month in (you can buy it at any point before the included warranty expires). Cost me ~$200 (you can use student discount at Apple stores) for 3 years of support. All the Mac people I know swear by Applecare, and it seems like a pretty good thing to have just in case. Battery life is still a solid 5-7hrs. if not more, depending on my usage. As expected, watching HD movies or playing games does kill the battery life. Bought this neoprene sleeve since it looked solid, was inexpensive, and had good reviews. Definitely recommend a case/sleeve of some kind to avoid scratching up the shell.Preface: I own a computer I built myself and have been continuously tinkering with and upgrading since 2007. This is my "primary" computer, and I virtually never use my Macbook while at home as a result. Prior to this purchase, the only Apple product I've owned is an iPod Touch from 2010. This is the perspective of a long-time Windows user with access to a computer of considerable horsepower. If you want to hear from someone who spends >90% of their computer time on this Macbook, I'm not your guy. However, I can still talk about the properties that make it strong for my demands of a portable, secondary computer for use whenever I'm not at home. I'll be breaking this review down into the criteria I needed my next laptop to satisfy, and where the Macbook Air fell in relation to the competitors.One-Sentence Review: The 2012 Macbook Air is not head-and-shoulders above the competition (it's not even the best in any one category) but it's so great at everything that it's hard to say no to.1. Portability: Both the 11" and 13" model have set the standard for the portable "ultrabook", and competition from Asus, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell, HP, and anyone else has used these laptops' dimensions as the benchmark. This 13" model weighs in at a svelte 2.9lbs., but in 2012 that's not really saying much. Look up the ultrabook offerings from the above companies and you'll see they're all within +/-0.1lbs. It's no doubt a lightweight and portable design, but I can't hand this one to Apple given how close everyone else is.Verdict: Draw for the Macbook, since everyone has the same dimensions and weight.2. Design & Build Quality: This used to be Apple's home court. The unibody aluminum shell of the Macbook Air was a league apart from the plastics of certain competitors. However, Samsung's Series 9 and Asus' Zenbook Prime give the Macbook Air a serious run for its money. To its credit, Apple is one of the few manufacturers who grace their ultrabooks with a super-large trackpad (which is superior to any PC laptop trackpad I've ever used) and backlit keyboard. The frame is sturdy, the lid doesn't creak or sway, and there's very little flex in the body.Verdict: Other guys look nice, but I have to give this to Apple on the back of the keyboard and oversized trackpad.3. Battery Life: I have yet to run my Macbook from full to empty, but I have used it for long stretches and (assuming the battery meter is accurate) can make a reasonable assessment of battery life. While browsing the web, writing a Word document, and listening to music, with screen at half-brightness, I was going for about 3.5hrs when I hit the 50% mark. A reasonable estimate places total battery life at 6.5-7hrs., which is right in Apple's factory estimate of 7. I bet you could squeeze an easy 9hrs. out of this by turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off and dimming the screen some. Regardless, I'm usually not away from an outlet for more than a few hours anyway, so this is a nice cushion to have. Also worth noting that the Sleep function seems to be extremely battery-efficient. 24hrs. of sleep resulted in only a 1% loss of battery life, and the Macbook instantly took me to the login screen when I hit the spacebar.Verdict: Extremely respectable battery life and fantastic sleep efficiency.4. Screen Quality: This is in my opinion the laptop's weakest category. The Macbook Airs use TN panels, with resolutions of 1366x768 for the 11" and 1440x900 for the 13". For the unacquainted, TN panels are the bottom shelf of LCD panels in terms of color quality. The aforementioned Zenbook Prime absolutely kills the competition with a 1080p (1920x1080) IPS panel (IPS is the top-shelf panel), and even the Series 9 has a respectable 1600x900 PLS (mid-range panel) display. This fall Apple introduced a Retina 13" Macbook Pro with an insane 2560x1600 display, but did not similarly update the Macbook Air. It may happen next year, but for now you're stuck with a low-end display. This is not to say it is objectively bad (it's not), but the competition does leave this laptop feeling somewhat inadequate.Verdict: The Macbook Air's TN panel just cannot compare to the IPS and PLS panels on other ultrabooks.5. Software: I had a passing familiarity with Mac OS X, and thought it to be a generally snappy, good-looking, but not well-supported OS. That last point is mostly untrue, as I have virtually everything I use on my desktop (MS Office, Spotify, Chrome, VLC Player, Steam(!), Dropbox) running natively on OS X without any issues. There's a bit of a learning curve, but I found it a genuine joy to acquaint myself with Mountain Lion's "Mission Control" feature. This allows you to create multiple desktops with independent docks and applications, effectively allowing you to segregate your computer for work and play. Many of Mountain Lion's features, as well as Safari, are well-integrated with multi-touch gestures on the trackpad, so executing commands through the trackpad is wonderfully simple. I miss the comfort of Windows only slightly, to be honest.Verdict: OS X is a very well-designed OS for anyone who isn't strictly tied to Windows.6. Value: Value is awkward and highly subjective. You have to make your own goals before any purchase, and evaluate which alternative offers the best chance of fulfilling that goal. As a first-year medical student with a very competent primary computer, my goals were to have a reliable, portable, and decently powerful laptop for bringing around with me to class, the library, lab, and anywhere else that wasn't my apartment. Ideally this would be a 4-year computer, lasting me the entirety of medical school. $1100 is a lot of money to spend on a laptop, so I had to be sure of what I picked. In the end I went with this because of the literally dozens of classmates and friends who have had the same Macbook (Pro/Air/whatever) for years without a hiccup or slowdown. I feel this is due in part to Apple's willingness to make its OS as backwards-compatible as possible, which means you get a non-bloated OS that's designed to work as well on yesteryear's technology as tomorrow's.Verdict: TBDIf you've made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read, and I hope you found this useful. I would add a final caveat about potential improvements to the 2013 Macbook Air, but honestly don't give it much thought. There's always one more thing coming around the corner, and if you need a laptop now just get this one. Like I said, it's not the best at anything (except the trackpad maybe) but it's great at everything and should last you for years.::icarus::5.0::November 12, 2012
R2MKUDXKC5GLF9::Absolutely amazing lightweight notebook::Going from a White Macbook circa 2008 to the 2012 Macbook Air is a massive leap forward in technology for me. The big question is deciding which one will be best for you: The 13" Macbook Pro or the 13" Macbook Air.Things I like:It's fast! I plan on using this when I travel for Office, Adobe Lightroom and other photography applications. I'm able to move quickly, even when shuffling around hundreds of photos in Lightroom. This is remarkably different from my old Macbook.The SSD. Absolutely fast. Bootup/shutdown/restart times are in seconds. Yes, it's pricy, but I love it.Solid build. It feels much like other Macbook Pros, despite the thinness. Yes, it feels like it'll be a magnet for scratches, so I'm off to find a case/skin.Opposite side USB ports! The most annoying thing about my Macbook (old White, new MBP as my office computer) is that there's not enough spacing between the USB ports, so a chunkier flashdrive and another USB device won't fit. Now I don't feel like I have to choose what gets plugged in.USB 3.0. I've got enough USB 3.0 flash drives and the speed increase will be noticeable. Thunderbolt technology is supposed to be a lot faster, but a lot more expensive and quite frankly, cost-prohibitive.Weight: I've gotten used to heavier laptops so this feels downright thin. Thin enough that I don't notice it in my bag.Screen resolution: 1440x900 gives me more real estate than the 1280x800 of the 13" Macbook Pro. The screen was bright and vivid.---Things I don't like:Non-upgradeable: So much for adding more RAM down the road.New Magsafe power connector: This might cause an issue with places that have older Macbooks as well and determining which is which. That's what labels are for.Aluminum case: It's beautiful but I'm feeling worried that I'm going to scratch it.Software update: 350MB worth of fixes out of the box. Ugh.---Sound. It's decent enough - it seems like any other laptop's audio that I've ever used. If you're serious about audio, you'll have external speakers (or even pair it up with Airplay speakers.)Battery: I got about 6 hours in a torture test of watching video while surfing the web on WiFi. It's pretty decent and within the 5-7 range that Apple stated.DVD drive: I don't miss it. I thought I would, but I don't. It just adds weight and bulk to the computer.The webcam is also a higher resolution 720p camera. It's quite nice, but now the downside is that during Facetime, my friends and family can see my ugly self more clearly. Also, early adopters won't have the computer come with the newest version of OS X - Mountain Lion. That will come in mid/late July. It's nice that this will come gratis to those who bought early.The big question is Macbook Air or Macbook Pro? It comes down town a number of issues. If this will be your primary computer, then Macbook Pro is the way to go. The MBP is a faster computer with more storage and an optical drive. If you plan on doing any high-end computing, you'll notice the difference. If this is going to be a secondary computer or if weight is the deciding factor, then the Macbook Air is for you. Either way, you can't go wrong.::Nick "whereishawkins"::5.0::June 19, 2012
R11BGG5IOAJ13::Wifi problems::This is a wonderful product, well designed and very light. Unfortunately, the Wifi is not reliable. I have many other Apple products connecting to my home network with no problems, but this MacBook Air just can't keep a reliable connection. The connection slows down to a crawl every few minutes, sometimes it drops.On Apple users forums, I discovered hundreds of other people had the same problem (google for 'Macbook Air Wifi problems'.) Some hoped that an upgrade to Mountain Lion would fix the problem, but this is not the case.::Christophe::3.0::August 29, 2012
R1V910VCJ74QVE::My First Mac::The first Apple product I owned was a 1st generation iPod Nano. From there I got an iPhone (1st Gen), iPad 1, and the 3rd generation iPad (most of these were gifts). I had good experiences with all of them and my MSI laptop was dying on me, so I decided to get my first Mac. I ordered an upgraded Air with 8GB or RAM from the Apple store. It arrived in eight days, and as always, it was beautifully packaged.Here are some my observations after owning it for about a month:- The multitouch trackpad is one of my favorite features. It is intuitive and much better than a mouse/scrollwheel. Going back to a Windows computer actually felt a little weird because I didn't have the multitouch gesture controls (e.g. swiping to go back in the web browser or two finger zoom). The keyboard has a nice feel to it and is quite quiet.- The computer boots up in 10 - 15 seconds, which is around 3 to 4 times faster than my friend's 2009 MacBook Pro. And the Air usually shuts down in 3 seconds. Waking up from sleep is almost instantaneous. All of this is possible because the Air has a SSD whereas most laptops today have traditional hard drives.- Wi-fi connects really fast. I can visit a website right after boot up/wakeup.- The Air is relatively quiet. The only time I usually hear the fan is after I have been streaming a video for a while. Even then, you don't hear the fan for long.- FaceTime looks much better with the 720p camera in the Air compared to the new iPad.- The speakers are solid. If I have computer playing music downstairs, I can still hear it upstairs. And turning up the volume doesn't distort the sound. Of course, the computer speakers pale in comparison to my Logitech Z-2300's.- GeekBench score of around 6150.- The appstore makes installing software much easier.- It's easy to plug in a monitor and use my computer with the lid closed (clamshell mode). You'll need to plug in a keyboard and mouse.- The Air is beautiful and light. It was almost too nice to use at first.- The battery charges pretty fast - it's at 22% right now and OS X estimates that it'll take an hour and 16 minutes to charge the rest of the battery.- Some reviewers and users have complained about the MagSafe 2 power connector (they like the first one more). As a first time Mac owner who haven't experienced the MagSafe 1, all I can say is that it hasn't been a problem for me, though my Air pretty much stays on my desk all day long.But it's not perfect:- I like my screen to be bright but based on my estimations, the battery won't last 7 hours if the screen is set to the brightest setting.- The bottom left corner of the trackpad is much lower than the other three corners of the trackpad. I don't think it'll be a big deal, but it'd be nice if it was perfectly aligned, especially considering how much Macs cost.- Two USB ports aren't enough, especially if you plan on using clamshell mode a lot. Since I don't have a USB hub, I have to exit clamshell mode whenever I wanted to plug in my external hard drive or print something.- Minecraft froze on me twice.Not Apple's fault:- Chrome is my favorite browser but I can't use it right now because of some bug that causes Lion to freeze up when Chrome is used. (See update below.)I'm still figuring out some things in Lion but overall, I'd give it 4 and a 1/2 stars! Recommended.Update (7/4): I downloaded Chrome after Google came out with an update for it. I haven't had any issues so far.Update (7/21): I've stuck with Safari because it feels snappier than Chrome.Update (7/29): I downloaded and installed Mountain Lion. Dictation is my favorite new feature (Safari's unified URL/search bar is my second favorite). Even with speakers playing music less than a foot away from my Air, the mic picks up what I'm saying quite accurately. I'd give accuracy a B+/A-. See my example below. And I recently had issues with videos buffering really slowly, though I don't know if it's the modem/router's fault. The problem seems to be fixed after the Mountain Lion update.Update (9/1): I have Avast Free Antivirus installed and it's been causing some issues. When I shut down the computer, it automatically restarts it and I get a report saying there was some sort of kernel panic. This usually happens once or twice a week. I don't think this is Apple's fault though. On another note: Using an external monitor along with your Air's monitor doesn't require you to have the power adapter plugged in but using the Air in clamshell mode does require the adapter to be plugged in. Kind of dumb if you think about it. You'd think that clamshell mode uses less power than supporting two monitors.Update (9/12): I updated Avast and haven't had the restart issue since. it's also interesting to note that when I use FaceTime while blasting music from an external speaker ~2 feet away, the other person can't hear the music but can hear me.Update (10/28): I had to bring my Air into the Apple store because of an issue with my screen - if you looked at it from an angle, there was a white/bluish spot that wouldn't go away. Scheduling an appointment at the Genius Bar (my first ever) was easy and it started right on time, even at 6:30pm on a Friday evening. The Apple Genius took a quick look at it and determined it was an issue with the interior of the screen. And instead of fixing it, which they said would've taken at least 10 days, they replaced my machine with a top-of-the-line 13" Air with a 2.0 GHz processor and 512GB SSD (my old machine had a 1.8GHz processor and the standard 128GB SSD) at no charge. Since they gave me a brand new computer, I got a new MagSafe 2 charger too. The retail difference between the two machines is over $700. On top of that, they "refunded" my AppleCare and restarted it from the day I took it in. To say the least, I'm an extremely satisfied customer.Update (11/17): My new MBA (see the update on 10/28) seems to be quieter than my original MBA. I don't hear the fan as often, even after streaming videos for a while.---Dictation example [Nothing after the colon will be edited except for punctuation/capitalization. Things in brackets are not dictated]: This is an example of the dictation feature in Mountain Lion. I am speaking about one and a half feet away from the mike in a room that is relatively quiet. The only background noise is coming from a different room. I am talking relatively slowly right now so let's see how well the dictation feature works when I talk little faster and with the music in the background.[Turned music on, speakers are about 2 1/2 to 3 feet away. The volume is set at 25% on the speakers and 50% in OS X]Okay, no music playing in the background and I'm talking a little faster. I would say it is still pretty accurate. I think the dictation feature is pretty useful. However, I think it would be pretty awkward to use in public or at work. The best place to use it would still be at home in private. Next I'm going to read awesome tests on the right side column in a normal speaking rates with the music still playing in the background.[Begin reading random text]What makes a good review?Be detailed and specific but when you wanted to know before you purchase the product?

R2GLZSA5II4X0D::Overwhelmingly Happy with this Laptop::Now that Macs can run Windows, I am glad I can buy Macs and get the best of both worlds.  I purchased my Macbook Air for school.  I am a Sophomore at college and I have used a Macbook Pro, an HP Laptop, and most recently an iPad.  The first two were bulky and added a lot of weight to my backpack.  I ended up leaving the laptops at home and using campus computers instead, negating the purpose of even having a laptop.Next, I tried an iPad.  While it was super easy to carry around and beautiful to use, it wasn't as functional as I'd have liked due to the restrictive software (iOS) and lack of ability to help me with programming in my computer science degree plan.I took a chance and bought the Macbook Air and was instantly relieved of these problems.  It is incredibly light, thus enabling me to carry it around in my backpack and hardly know it is there at all.  You can hold it between your thumb and finger with no problem, it is so light.  It is VERY quiet.  I rarely hear the fan come on.  The screen has a great resolution, and the newer features brought from the Macbook Pro (back-lit keyboard, for example) are a great addition.  I have a Corsair Voyager GT USB 3.0 flash drive and transferring files is insanely quick thanks to the two USB 3.0 ports.  Having one on each side helps a lot.  I have been getting comments about how nice the laptop is.  Please note, I don't use this for gaming so I can't say how powerful it really is.I have not encountered any Wifi issues as some have said.  I did have a little bit of a problem getting Bootcamp to install Windows 7 because it didn't like my USB drive for that.  I had to borrow someone else's drive but it worked a charm then.  I enjoy flipping to Windows to do my programming at school, then switching back to OSX to browse the web and watch movies.  This is the best laptop I have ever bought.-----------------------------------UPDATE: 3/31/2013The Air is still running great. I wanted to add that I have played Portal 2 and a couple of other older games on the laptop and they actually run very well. The only thing is, the fans come on and it can be a little loud once the graphics start churning out.::C. M. Poole::5.0::October 8, 2012
R37YNMMSAH9D0E::Returned my top Ultrabook for this... and no regrets::Before I start this review, I would like to mention that I had an Asus Zenbook UX31A for a week or two before I ordered the Air. The Ultrabook was stellar - most reviewers say it is the top Ultrabook out right now (the MBA technically does not classify as an Ultrabook), but it had some shortcomings that I could not stand. Therefore, I bought the Air instead. Anyways, here is my opinion on the 13" MBA (2012 edition).Pros:- VERY thin and light and small- Looks nice and original, design-wise- AMAZING trackpad. Seriously... no other laptop has this good of a trackpad. The multitouch gestures are phenomenal and making using the MBA a breeze.- Chiclet backlit keyboard- Not that much bloatware compared to the UX31A- Very fast SSD - great write speeds- (Related to SSD) Fast bootup and sleep resume times (faster than the UX31A)- Great Apple warranty support- Enough hard drive space by stock - I had around 108GB available by stock which is pretty good compared to some other ultrabooks- Very loud and clear speakers- Display is not overly saturated- USB 3.0 ports- Get the satisfaction of having a Mac ;)- Ability to dualboot/use Parallels to get Windows 7Cons:- The resolution could be higher. The UX31A has a 1080p display, which absolutely murders this. Still, 1440x900 isn't bad.- Battery life is okay. I get ~6 or 6.5 hours, which is fine, but it really should be higher.- You own an Apple product, which requires you to either be ignorant or constantly defend yourself. You choose.Okay well that is my unbiased (I think) review on the Macbook Air. So far I love my choice of returning the UX31A to get the Air. If anyone has any other questions about the Air or comparisons between this and the Zenbook, please comment.::Imran::5.0::July 22, 2012
RGKCMTE2BN7LT::Returned upgraded SSD 13" MacBook Pro for this, no regrets!::I upgraded from a 2010 HP Envy 14 to the 13" MacBook Pro about 3 weeks ago. I tinker at a basic level, so I opted to purchase a SATA III SSD and 2x4GB 1600MHz RAM on my own and installed it. So, I had an upgraded MBP 13" I was very proud of.Over the next week, I came to realize I should probably return the SSD, RAM, and MBP for a BTO MacBook Air with 8 GB of RAM. This was based on the following:1) Lighter Weight: I carry my laptop everywhere I go, often making 3 or more trips with the laptop in my bag. The extra 1.5 lb. from the MacBook Pro makes a difference to me, and I'm not a small guy at all.2) Better resolution: The MBP 13" resolution maxes out at 1280x800. The 1440x900 on the MBA is more functional and allows better detail useful for work. Buyers should be aware that the MacBook Pro 13" has a better color gamut though - intensive Photoshop work requiring color accuracy might be better on the MBP.3) Sufficient RAM: Running a memory clearing app (Clear Memory) showed me that I hover right at 4GB of RAM usage in my daily tasks, mostly involving Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook on Windows Office 2011 for Mac on top of 5-15 open Chrome browser tabs. Getting 8GB of RAM would put me in the clear, meaning I would never need or use the maximum of 16GB allowed by the MacBook Pro.4) Comparable performance: The lower clockspeed and voltage of the i5 on the MBA had me concerned at first, but most benchmarks show the MBP i5 outperforming the MBA's i5 by only about 5-10%. Since I did nothing that required that additional speed and the MBP i5 seemed plenty zippy to me, I decided that the MBA's i5 wouldn't be a noticeable downgrade in performance.5) Sufficient disk space: 128GB is plenty for me. I access most of my work files from a shared server and store videos/photos/music on an external HDD to save space anyway.Basically, I came to the conclusion that buying the MacBook Air upgraded to 8GB for $100 was a better bang for the buck, with sufficient future proofing, when compared to buying a stock 13" MacBook Pro with user-upgraded SSD and RAM.I got my MacBook Air in the mail last week and returned my MacBook Pro. I haven't looked back - the performance feels identical to me, packed into a tighter and more portable shell.::Nick H::5.0::July 23, 2012
R1QJCPLV30P3EY::From the perspective of a .NET web developer/former PC only user::This MacBook Air is my 5th Apple product and definitely won't be my last but I am in no way an Apple fangirl though I'm beginning to have a whole new appreciation for all of their products and the whole ecosphere, but I do recognize its faults.  I put off the purchase of a Mac laptop for at least two years trying to make do with my PC.  I bought a high-end Sony Vaio with every feature I wanted except a lighted keyboard.  Other than having to occasionally use Adobe CS and Visual Studio on Windows to do .NET development, I haven't given my old laptop a second thought since I got the Air 3 months ago.I run a Windows virtual machine on my iMac but I didn't want to adulterate this machine with it.  So, I do as much coding as I can using Sublime Text, Coda, and Espresso and only use my Windows machine when I absolutely have to open a project in Visual Studio.  I'm waiting for Adobe CS7 to come out before switching that over to Mac also.  I really like the Mountain Lion OS and am committed to becoming a true Mac user all the time.  The switch from Windows to Mac presents some paradigm shifts for long-time Windows users, and there are quite a few things to get used to especially when using ported programs such as Office for Mac, but otherwise the overall experience is very good and generally well thought-out.  One thing that amazed me was that, out of the box, I literally had this new machine up and running and connected to Dropbox and my mail, contacts and calendar from my iPhone in less than 10 minutes.  I've wrestled with new PCs for over an hour getting up and running so as you can imagine, this was a really refreshing difference.I ordered my Air directly from Apple in order to get an education discount and a back to school gift card that was a better deal than Amazon's.  I upgraded the RAM to 8GB because I knew I was eventually going to be running CS, among other things, and I didn't want to tax the life of the SSD by constantly using the swap space.  Now I really wish I had gone ahead and upgraded the SSD also since the factory software, Office, and a few other programs I've added as well as my music library has me down to around 20GB of free space, yikes.So here goes.  First, the good stuff:1) The battery life.  I am clocking 6-8 hours per charge and that includes running the screen on at least half brightness or higher, having the backlit keyboard on it's lowest light setting, and running several programs including numerous browser tabs.  I've never gotten more than about 3 hours tops off a PC laptop battery, ever, and that's being extremely miserly with consumption.2) The size and weight.  It is almost unbelievably thin and light, especially compared to my old PC laptop which wasn't necessarily huge, but still a big difference.3) The screen.  It is so bright and clear and possesses normal, natural color quality - an absolute must for web designers/developers.  Also the native resolution, at 1440x900, is more pixels in less space (13" vs. 15.4") than my Vaio's 1366x768.4) The trackpad.  Hands down the best trackpad any laptop has ever seen.  Your fingers glide over it so smoothly.  When I do have to use my old laptop now, the trackpad feels like someone has left tape on it too long and removed it, leaving behind the sticky stuff.  The multi-touch gesturing is amazing, convenient, and super intuitive.5) The keyboard.  I have achieved my fastest typing speeds yet on this keyboard.  I really liked the keyboard on my Vaio as it was my first PC laptop with the chicklet style keys.  This one is even better in every way possible.6) The speed.  On/off in seconds as opposed to minutes for HDDs.7) The quiet.  Noticeably missing is the sound of any processor/fan/etc.  It's soooo nice.  My Vaio's fan runs nearly constantly.  The only sound I hear right now is the clicking of my fingernails against the keys, pure bliss.8) The App Store.  If you like the App Store for iPhone, you'll very quickly come to love it for the Mac. I was able to quickly connect to some of my favorite apps on my phone and share the data between them.9) Network connections and backups.  Connecting to new networks and running backups couldn't be faster or easier.  Mac has definitely got PC beat in this area by a landslide.  Bluetooth and Wifi are flawless.  Bluetooth on my PCs has always been super spotty.10) Adding peripherals.  No need to install/download anything to connect to your printer and many other peripherals.  I've connected to printers in places I've never been before in a matter of seconds - impossible on a PC.Finally, the not-so-good stuff:1) Most programs, especially those with more mature PC counterparts, don't quite act the same as what I'm accustomed to, specifically in the area of keyboard shortcuts.  Some of them are simply missing, others require more key presses than usual.  We're talking default configuration here though there are a lot of options which can be configured in the preferences.  In this same vein, I am also having a difficult time getting used to clicking the Command key instead of the CTRL key for keyboard shortcuts, especially since my muscle memory wants to press the key that's in the control key position on the Mac which actually happens to be the control key on the Mac, it just doesn't do what a long-time PC user expects it to.2) No dedicated delete, pg up, pg down, etc. buttons.  Traditional PC-like deletion requires a press of the function key in addition to the "delete" key which is actually what we PC users know as the BACKSPACE key, ugh.3) As much as I love the trackpad, there is room for improvement particularly in the area of the multi-touch gestures.  It seems like it would be super easy to allow for some customization or even offer some pre-programmed convenience features like three-finger tap to cut/copy/paste, etc.  There are several apps that make this possible, which serves to indicate Apple's oversight here.4) File system organization and management takes a little getting used to coming from the Windows environment.  Also, I'm entirely out of my element with the Mac command line, and I suspect most long-time Windows users would be as well.5) Safari pretty much sucks.  I immediately installed Chrome and Firefox for testing purposes anyway but Chrome is my browser of choice.  One really frustrating thing though is that Chrome for Mac doesn't yet allow the option to open tabs from the browser bar when pressing enter like it does on the PC.6) The Mac OS runs an Apple-ized version of Java which hasn't necessarily given me any problems yet, but I am constantly getting warnings that I need to update Java when using programs like LogMeIn, GoToMeeting, and WebCT.  If I try to update Java, I get a warning that says it will overwrite Apple's Java (something I haven't had time to research yet to know whether it's good, bad, or neither).7) The aluminum casing is beautiful but is very easy to scratch and dent.  You'll want/need a cover/case/sleeve/etc.  I highly recommend the Incase Neoprene Sleeve For Macbook Air 13-Inch -  Black (CL57802).I was initially concerned that my work and school development workflow might be interrupted by going all Mac, but in reality, if anything, it's been bolstered because I absolutely am in love with this machine and since it's so portable, I take it everywhere!  If you're like me and you're torn over the decision because of the Windows development issue, you won't be sorry if you make this purchase.  Plus, Mac computers hold their value better than any other on the market so if you absolutely hate it (you won't), you can always take a (very) small loss by selling it back on Amazon or eBay.::Dacia Gulledge::5.0::December 10, 2012
R294N354OUN3MV::I'm a brand new first time Apple OSX user and this machine is really quite remarkable::I'm a brand new first time Apple OSX user and this machine is really quite remarkable.  I'm a software developer and i purchased this laptop to use for learning iOS development, and i have to say, it's an impressive device. The form factor is nothing short of amazing. The fit and finish are great.  I love the back lit keyboard, and the large, gesture enabled trackpad.  The screen looks very nice and the SSD makes the machine feel very zippy considering its relatively modest specs. When closed, this laptop and my ipad take up less space in my bag than my 15" dell did all by itself, and together they're much lighter.  It even has a much longer battery life.I've tasted the apple cool-aid and i'm beginning to believe.::Trevis Thomas::5.0::December 26, 2012
R3FYNXWA1KO6LM::Mac Noob has found true love::Ok let's get a couple things out of the way first and foremost so this review is PERFECTLY understood by anyone that stumbles across it.1.  I'm an avid gamer and I play my games on a custom PC running Windows 7 Professional2.  I have neither desire nor expectations concerning GAMING on this MacBook Air (ok, MAYBE minecraft or Civilization 4 and/or 5Now that we're clear on that, I absolutely LOVE this machine.  I have Microsoft Office University (4 year license) and run Office on my PC as well as my Mac and have had ZERO issues going back and forth between PC/Mac.  Something may come up down the road because the PC runs Office 2013 and the Mac runs Office 2011 but so far I've had NO ISSUES at all.  I love that.  I don't always want to sit on the couch and use Office.  Sometimes I want to sit at my desk and work with Office.  I have the best of both worlds here as far as I'm concerned.  No, this is not a MS Office review so let's move on.The MacBook Air boots from POWERED DOWN to FULLY OPERATIONAL in less than 10 seconds.  It boots from SLEEP mode to FULLY OPERATIONAL in 2 to 3 seconds.  Now this is a brand new machine and all I have installed is Office and 5 or 6 other app's so far but at this moment the speed and the super light mobility of the MacBook Air has made my life so much easier...I use my iPad mini during lecture to take handwritten notes on my Professor's 'Powerpoint' slides (not actually Powerpoint but Apple's version, I forget the name) because I can sketch drawings and such with ease.  I send those notes to my Cloud/Dropbox/Google Drive and when I get home I work with them on the Mac OR PC.The keyboard is backlit and high quality regarding key responsiveness.  I like the 'chicklet' style.  It doesn't have a full size numpad but being a great typist it doesn't bother me at all.  The aluminum body/case or whatever you call it is tight and strong.  It feels strong.  If you've held a cheap half plastic laptop in your hands you know what I mean.  The Air is solid.  The screen looks fantastic and clear.I haven't even connected a mouse to it yet because I haven't needed it.  The touchpad/trackpad/whatever works great, stock, right out of the box.  Long time Mac users list an app as a MUST HAVE that lets you reassign a gazillion new gestures to the pad and I'm going to download that next but I had to comment on it anyway because as I said, this is my first Mac, and I'm impressed with the touchpad.  I've been using a hot rod gaming mouse for the last 20 years and I say this honestly... I don't miss it.  I haven't needed it, at least not yet.  The built in WiFi is running great right out of the box.  I have a Netgear router that does N protocol and my Mac zips right along surfing the net and downloading fairly large files.Well, what more to say?  I love this machine.  Super light, super quick boot up/refresh from sleep and it has a great keyboard.  The only drawback I can think of is that I wish you got a little bit more for your $ from Apple but this is just my opinion.  What I mean is that I bought a 128 GB model and I wish that for the price I could've gotten a 256 GB.  Honestly, if I could've afforded it RIGHT NOW, I'd have gotten the highest capacity Solid State Drive that they offer.  I'm going to guess that most Apple customers feel this way as well but what are we gonna do?The bottom line is this:  This machine is light, fast, sturdy, stylish, easy to transport, and rock solid when it comes to running all the software I need to use.*THIS IS NOT A FANCY LOOKING GAMER MACHINE*This is a great laptop for college students and, for lack of better words, ADULT computing.Simply put, "I love it".I hope my review helps somebody make a good decision about whether or not they buy the product.::S.

R1AUQH3YF8IST6::Own Every Apple Product Made, but the Macbook AIR is my only 'always Go-to' Product::Sitting around typing on my macbook air, with a mac mini near and the newest macbook pro nearby,...Ive used this Macbook air now for nearly 2 years, believe or not, its speakers are louder and clearer than the MBP (unless you install the BOOM application to boost volume), and the screen is far superior, not in my opinion, but apple inc. itself admits that even a 2 year old Macbook Air has a superior/sharper screen (samsung made) than the screen on the NEW non-retina Macbook pros. If the SSD 6 seconds to boot doesnt impress you about the MB Air, then the fact that its a SMOKING FAST computer that weighs in right at the level of an IPAD, ....if you want to turn on your computer and do something REAL FAST and do a shutdown and run along in life, then ONLY the Macbook AIR is a go.All the power of a desktop, but FASTER (ssd drive).....lite as an IPAD, easy to pack around without bruising your shoulder. I must have heard at least a 1000 people lament "jeez, I wish I'd bought an AIR instead of my MBP!".  No optical drive? Who cares, stick your torrent movies on a $70 1TB HD and pack it around.Its pathetic and laughable that anyone complained about 128GB of HD space when a 1TB portable drive is now around $65! Insanity. Just get a Macbook AIR, you'll be glad you did.The Macbook AIR really is the 'all future laptops will be somewhat like this'., and thats a fact. Conventional HD are slowing dying out as SSD become cheap, and the notion of a MBP in ANY flavour, even the Retina, is a joke. The Retina MBP is useless unless youre a pro photographer or plan on video editing, since it has NO optical drive, you have absolutely and utterly NO purpose in owning a Retina display laptop, NONE.And as far as relative to the MBP retina: As many new Retina MBP users have recently lamented "hey, my old macbook air is running faster than my new Retina MBP!?"::VeritasluxMea "Neoplatonic Platonist"::5.0::April 19, 2013
REB1SZTW304D1::A cutie!::I have always been a PC user. My HP laptop start to have severe overheating problem( so hot it hurts if I put my finger over the fan area for more than 5 sec).I do have also have a Dell laptop issued by work, however, it is too heavy for me to carry around school all day.  I decided to give it up and hunt for a new one.  I not a crazy apple fan, I am only a fan of quality. After getting a iPhone 4s this year, I was truly impressed by its stylish design, features and over quality. That made me put apple brand into consideration.... ok, enough of the story and let's get into the real part.I was debating over Macbook air or Macbook pro. After lifting both of them up several time, Mac Air wins without a doubt. If you are student or a traveler, I highly recommend the air. I was a little disappointed after realize there is no HDMI or a ethernet port on the Air ( I heard you can by a Ethernet adopter around $30). I was even more scared when suddenly switch from PC environment to Mac environment. Just like other people said, it feels like mac has everything backward from pc, and the thought of return it came across my mind a few times on the first day. HOWEVER, after couple days, I start to LOVE it. I  thought about returning it because I am afraid the change and too lazy to make the effort to learn something new before I really use it. It turns out that I do not need much effort to learn at all, I just need to start to use it.  The back lit keyboard is cute, the trackpad is amazing ( make sure you take a glance at the little booklet in the package, it tells you different ways to play with your trackpad, trust me, it will not take you more than 10 sec to understand and remember the gestures). If you are one of the PC -->Mac user, my suggestion would be use both in parallel for awhile until you naturally attracted to mac completely!  I have been owning my mac air for a week now, and I loved it more each day and got very use to it. It is so cute, fast and stylish that just makes me happy!I do not get hot headed nor satisfied easily, but this  little thin mac air just simply makes me happy!::Victoria::5.0::October 21, 2012
R2TTMZ7OZGG9IV::It's about time I switch from micro&$&@::Five plus  star is the review.  I love my Mac air.  Thank you Apple.  Three months now and no crashes.  Instant on and off.  A standby that works.  Fast and easy.  I was a Microsoft user for years.  Microsoft 7 and 8 stand for 7 or 8 times more problems.  At first I had buyers remorse because I had to learn the new operating system.  After a week the Mac air made 100% common sense.  No more new menus to learn after every new release of Windows or Office.  My windows pc was a boat anchor.  My Mac air is so easy to carry in my work bag.  I have been able to get all my software on the Mac.  I have no idea why companies stay with windows.  The time ms windows takes to boot, the high number crashes, the connectivity issues, the security issues, viruses,  etc., etc., etc.,  The raw waste messing around trying to get the windows based system to work everyday, year after year.  My Apple offers No more Windows' reliability, quality and performance issues wasting my time.  Do I really care about a new operating system from ms windows? I can't wait around for them to get it right.  After 30 years mirco$@&$ still wants me to pay for junk. I  just want something that works and adds value to my life.  I actually enjoy using a computer again.  My Mac has fast turn on, connects everywhere, no crashes, long battery life, no security issues, light weight, easy, easy os and application software upgrades, connects to my iphone and ipad, etc., etc., etc.,I wish I would of never wasted so much of my life with Microsoft upgrades, crashes, viruses, boot time, memory hog, reliability, slow performance, etc., etc., etc.,  I would pay money to line up windows machines and blow them all away with a 12 gauge shotgun. Micr$&@? has no idea the definition of the words useful, reliable, quality, performance, robust and easy.My Mac air has added value buy successfully performing the requested task and having zero computer software and hardware issues.  It easily connects to my iPhone, iPad and the world every time I use it.  Thanks Apple!::B. Duff "Bcduff"::5.0::October 20, 2012
R1M8K3MOY95ZM4::Truly Outstanding::Despite being the guy who wrote the article about how with an iPad and a keyboard case you don't need a laptop anymore, I had a large case that was going to trial that required the purchase of a laptop.  Despite being an Apple guy generally (4S, iPad, 27 iMac) I cheaped out and bought a HP Envy 4.  My justification was similiar performance at half the cost.After spending time with a group including a MacBook Pro 13, a Dell ultra book,  my HP ultra book and a couple of recent vintage 13" Airs I saw the error of my ways.  Display, keyboard, general speed, sleep, start up,  and battery life are all better on the Air.  The much better display and battery life alone justify the additional cost.  The track pad is also outstanding as is the keyboard and general build quality,  I exchanged the Envy for the Air along with a significant payment which ended up being the best money I've spent in a while.Make sure you update to OS 10.8.2.  Not only do you get (with the related firmware upgrade) true 8 hour battery life so long as you keep brightness at half way (which is as bright as  the Envy at 75%) you get the ability to dictate pretty accurately into most applications.My only complaint to date is that the OS Email server has no ability to limit email uptake on accounts like the iPad. I have only found one program to date that I could not get in a Mac OS flavor and Office 2011 for Mac is a superior product to the PC version.  The only compatibility problem I have had to date is with an Epson projector whose wireless USB key supposedly does not work with a Mac OS despite there being a suitable patch on the Epson website.  While there truly is no need to go there this computer works nearly as well in PC emulation mode if you insist.SInce I originally wrote this review I have only grown to love this computer more.  It is truly one of those things that is the best of the best and to think that you can acquire a best of the best for just a bit more than ordinary is extraordinary itself.  I truly enjoy this computer in every way and use it as much as I can as it is such a joy to use,This  is an outstanding computer.  I love it!  So will you.::Justarasta::5.0::October 15, 2012
R3TS5LMDBQAMWE::Pure Awesome!!!!::I switched to a 2012 MacBook Air from a 2011 15" MacBook Pro (2.0GHz Quad i7). I was nervous to make the switch because I did want something lighter, but didn't want to sacrifice the speed of my MacBook Pro. I purchased the 13.3" which has the same resolution as the 15" MacBook Pro, so I didn't lose on the realestate of the screen. I am very impressed with the speed and do not regret getting rid of my 15" MBP one bit. The solid state drive makes up for the less powerful processor and graphics. The snappiness of the computer is tremendous. I would highly recommend the computer to anyone. One of the biggest problems with my MacBook Pro was the temperature. Sometimes you couldn't have it sitting on your lap because it got so hot. The MacBook Air stays nice and cool. You can sit with it on your lap in the summer without dying of heat.Buy one....you'll love it! Also, I did upgrade to 8GB and it was definitely worth it.::Whitey::5.0::September 21, 2012
R19ZOE8LHICM7Y::Mac > PC::Let me start off by saying I've been a Windows user for 10+ years, and "thought" windows was the best out there and the easiest to use.  Ask me a day before I bought this computer, and I would swear nothing was better than Windows when it came to operating systems.  About a week after getting the system, and I'm seriously considering never buying a windows PC again.  If you are looking for your first mac then the MBA is perfect.I've had a iphone since January 2010 and its the best phone I have ever had.  Bought a iPad 2 last year because I wanted a travel device to watch movies on and play games on.  Then decided I'd like to trade in my iPad 2 and maybe upgrade to a Macbook to give it a try.  Loved everything Apple has made before then so I thought its only fair to try the OS and a computer from them.BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE.  There I said it.I will admit for the first few days, I hated it, everything was backwards from windows and just seemed so foreign.  Some reason thought never crossed my mind to send it back though.  Keep struggling with the OS but slowly starting to become better at using it and then after I got most of the shortcuts down and how everything works down.  I started to slowly like it then started to love it.  Everything on Mac is about being as user friendly as possible.  Once you get it down, I doubt anyone would really given the choice go back to a PC.I bought this not only to try but to replace my iPad 2 as i've said above, I wanted something with high portability while still performing extreme task and staying quick and smooth when I needed it to be.  My main computer is a Alienware::Thomas::5.0::August 31, 2012

Suffice it to say the first unit had dead pixels, the second wasn't properly sealed and the bottom would creak when used.  The third and longest lasting of the group is fine except for two issues: it doesn't stay asleep (randomly knocking me off IM conversations on my desktop) and it constantly has issues with the audio wherein things that should make sound do not.  The system makes noise, like when adjusting volume levels, but frequently Adium or Chrome or another application will just not play sounds.  Couple this with AirPlay audio randomly failing and I'm not that pleased.  Only a reboot seems to fix the issue.  This appears to be documented as an issue with the OS, but doesn't affect everyone so it's hard to say.It's minor in of itself but when it happens nearly on a daily basis I'm a bit put off.  So I'm going to try my 4th and final unit.  If the issues persist I'll drop my review, if not then it's a 5 star winner.Pros:++Lightweight++Fantastic battery life+Fast, thanks to SSD+Backlit keyboard+Amazing trackpadCons:-Edges are a bit sharp, can be painful to hold in certain circumstances-Bottom is aluminum so it can and will slide on your lap--Build quality and buggy software that should have been fixed by nowOS is a draw for me, I like Windows better for some things (gaming, file management), MacOS for other things (photography, general browsing).  If you're familiar with MacOS this is what you'd expect only better/worse with some regards (performance and battery life/build quality and bugs).::William B. Partridge::4.0::January 28, 2013
RIU4SZNA95WH2::Light and fast.::The perfect product? Very good for home and business. It is the second Mac I have and I am not going back to PC.::Gregory Kotlarsky::5.0::January 27, 2013
R1DZ42SBHVU2R::Great service and battery life::I ordered this on Monday and the price dropped US30 a day after, and Amazon refund the difference after I email them. Great serviceI use this laptop mainly for school, and in home I usually use my PC which has a larger screen and more softwares. So battery life is important to me. I browse and type notes every day for about 2hrs on this Air and two days later it is still more than 50% left. So this laptop can easily lasts me 8hrs with screen brightness lower down.I am new to Mac and I found this laptop a pleasure to use. With the lack of software and support for Windows system, I would not use Mac as my main laptop. But it is far more intuitive and faster compare to Windows laptops. Simply the best ultrabook ever.::Susan "Susan"::5.0::January 24, 2013

RS9I15EFSGY8B::Wow!::Having been a Windows OS user for ever, I never had the urge to try an iMac or Macbook for personal or business needs.  But, now teaching more university classes, I need my own laptop. The given capabilities are what drew me to the Macbook Air, mainly battery life, size, and durability.  While getting to know the OS, I have been easily acclimated to the system. Right now, I would recommend this versus a Macbook Pro, it works awesome.::J. Z. K. "Guru of goofy"::5.0::January 12, 2013
R4U6WSXKHLZJX::Macbook Air the way to go for school::If you are wondering which would be better for school, let me tell you the Macbook Air is the best way to go over the 13 inch Macbook Pro. 1) It's much lighter, 2) It's faster or more responsive thanks to the SSD. 3) The battery life is awesome. You can't go wrong with this laptop.::JustinJ::5.0::January 12, 2013
R33M1B7OCSVXPX::Good, but broke after only 6 months::The computer worked great! Until we did a system update, and then we got the white screen of death. Lost some stuff we hadn't yet backed up (oops, my bad!) and took it in to the Apple store to get a new harddrive put in. Thankfully under warranty, because that sucker would have been almost $800 to replace!! This from a 6 month old computer?? For shame!So, I was NOT happy about that. But, since the new harddrive was installed, and the Apple Genius people upgraded it to the latest OS while they were at it, I've been really happy with it. This was our first Mac (computer) purchase and I'm not 100% sure I would purchase a Mac again, mostly because of how bloody explensive they are, and yet for what I use it for, I can do the same things with a $400 PC. Email is still email on a Mac.....But you get stickers with it when you purchase, so there's that...::intotheblues::4.0::January 11, 2013
R10KVLV48B5JUH::Amazing is an Understatement::Cold boots in about 10 seconds, wakes from sleep nearly instantly, and less than 3 pounds. What more could you ask for?So glad I got the MBA. I was originally going to get the 13" MBP, but after reading a few reviews on here about the air being all flash technology I went with it.This has me wanting to put a solid state drive in my Mac mini!::Robin Swilley::5.0::December 25, 2012
R27Y6T29NSFIS5::So in love with this laptop::I'm a former educator and used MAC desktop computers way back in the 90's. After I stopped teaching, I became accustom to PC's. When I bought my first iPad, I decided to give MAC's another try. I can't recall why I ever stopped using them. My best guess is the price. Now I'm hooked on MACs. My work computer is a PC and I don't even like using it anymore. I bought this MAC after I went back to school to get my doctorate degree. When school is in session and I have to travel for work, I carry my work laptop (because I have to) and my MAC just so I can complete my coursework and not have to use my work PC to do it. I won't get into all of the technical comparisons of MACs and PCs; others have already done that. I'll simply say that it's user friendly, easy navigation, the mouse pad is much better than those on PCs (I typically use an external mouse with PCs, but I only use the mouse pad with my MAC) and the keyboard is more comfortable.::flhorizon::5.0::December 23, 2012
R29V8NO17ZTG23::Slim, Light and Fast!::The MacBook Air is lighter and slimmer than the MacBook Pro. The SSD hard drive on the MacBook Air makes a big difference in performance vs. the HDD drives. It boots fast, like in 10 seconds. The aluminum case is very well designed, it is thin and strong at the same time.::Esteban Vallejo::5.0::December 22, 2012
R6YYDU7L9UR0N::From PC to WOW::OK I have been a PC guy for, well since the punch card...yea Im pretty old.  I always bought PC cause I had to use it for work and everyone else had PC and Windows.  I am a traveling consultant and I now see all these people with these MacBook Air and I was jealous.  I finally broke down and changed over.  LOVE IT!  I am still finding all of the little tricks to moving around in this world but the platform is STRONG.::Ed Marra::5.0::December 14, 2012
R2JF2RW6LXMUA1::Over Priced::Over priced, but otherwise great. If you are debating an IPad vs. MacBook Air, and you are a student spend the extra money on the Air. iPad does not have a mouse option and you would have to touch the screen for some functions even if you buy a wireless keyboard for it. Also the Air has the full function program of Pages, and you can buy Microsoft Office for it as well. I love how light it is also.::ED::5.0::December 10, 2012
R16PJ1LDEN6HRQ::Better than any other laptops out there::I originally had a MBP 15 but it was too heavy to use on a daily basis since I have to bring it with me to class every day. I decided to get the Air and the difference is huge. It is so light I can hold it in one hand without fear of dropping it. Thanks to the SSD, it also starts up in 3-4 seconds which makes it a great portable device and discards the need of an ipad. The keyboard is great and I highly recommend u buy a keyboard cover because the oils from ur hand will eventually create permanent smudges on the keys. Also, it protects ur keyboard from anyone who uses ur laptop with dirty food-ridden fingers.::Chau Nguyen::5.0::December 7, 2012
R3POYGSHV33NWU::I was shocked!::IT JUST WORKS!I have been an avid windows user for many years. I was very skeptical about purchasing this notebook. I have owned 5-6 laptops in the past (1 Dell, 1 Toshiba, 1 HP,  2 Asus). Each laptop died within 2 years. This was usually due to hardware reliability issues and poor cooling design.While, apple does not always have the greatest spec:price ratio, it has the best reliability:price ratio. Don't buy this if you want a computer that will last a long time.This company knows how to make a reliable and trustworthy computer. However, not only is it reliable, its responsive! As a hardware guru and pc enthusiast, I regret to say this laptop will outperform most third party windows platforms.It took some time to get used to the new OS, but it has proven worthwhile. I can get things done so much faster!! (regardless of the processing power) OSX has been designed and tweaked for excellence towards a specific set of hardware.If you have not noticed, Microsoft is developing their own hardware platform for windows 8. The slew of 3rd party companies have simply proven themselves unworthy of the OS (Dell, Toshiba, HP, ASUS, SAMSUNG, etc) If you don't get an apple platform, then wait for the Microsoft platform. FACT: OS developers build better products than those that don't.::Josh::5.0::October 10, 2012
R329WR5A6566JA::It seemed expensive at the time, but I will never go back!::I'm a real estate agent, and I've been through 3 PC laptops in 5 years.  I didn't want more of the same.  I'm an ipadder and an iphoner.  I never guessed that I'd be a mac person, but it's happening.  The SSD hard drive is awesome in this computer. No more replacing hard drives.  It's the perfect traveling laptop, and it fires up in seconds literally.  If you're on the fence, do it.  You won't regret it.::Andy Peters::5.0::August 15, 2012
R61JF0N0U4J0J::Unbelievably light and thin!::I'm a longtime Apple Computer user.  From the Macintosh in the early 80's, through the dogs of the late 90's.  I thought my last MacBook was about as good as it gets, but this MacBook Air exceeds all expectations.  To my mind 13" is about the optimal screen size.  I do lots of spreadsheets and any thing smaller is impractical.  It seems bulletproof.  The battery easily lasts 6 hours...really haven't tried to see what the ultimate life is since 6 hours is a normal computer work day.  I like the lighted keys and the keyboard.  About my only complaint is the touch pad which I find has an annoying delay.  My last MacBook utilized a trackpad that was a lot more sensitive.  Perhaps all the new "gestures" that allow many operations to be performed directly from the pad are the reason.  For my money, I'd prefer using custom function keys which are easily configured.  All and all a spectacular machine!  I purchased from Amazon for a $50 discount over Apple's price and no sales tax although shipping was about $13, if I recall correctly.::Ronald Hynes "iPhone freak"::5.0::August 10, 2012
R3876R4LQ8LW2K::Perfect::I have had imac's, MacBooks, pro, iPads.  The air does the trick.  Easy to carry, does not get hot.  Base model is fine for most needs.  Space, multimedia, photos, docs, use the clouds.  I have a loaded imac 27 and to be honest the cost of the upgrades for me did not pan out in performance.  Don't get mr wrong, if you upgrade, you will see a performance increase.  But could not see a $300 difference between the imac i5 vs i7.  Hence, I would expect the same with the Mac air.  But we a talking $300 plus.  If you buy the base model, it's $100 less then apple store, and if your in a state with no sales tax burden, the base is a great buy.  The quality of the air is amazing.  For me it will replace my ipad, even thou I still like my ipad, the mac air does it all.  As for the air vs the pro, for a college student , the pro might be a better choice as a sole computer.  But if you have desktop, the pro is duplication, but portable.  The MacBook Air is light weight, thin, and perfect for most tasks.  IMHO the MacBook Air at $1098 is way to go.::Mike60::5.0::February 20, 2013
R39HHQBX2P7Z6R::I can't put it down!::My first Apple was a 2008 Macbook Pro that my graduate program forced us all to buy.  While I was annoyed at the cost, I quickly became a fan of the form of the machine as well as the bombproof operating system.  However the machine was slightly large for my needs and the battery life was poor.  After 4 years of heavy use it was time for a replacement, and at this point I wasn't going back to brand X. I also needed something smaller than the Pro.I replaced it with this MacBook Air.  I did not buy Apple's extended warranty and do not recommend it based on my previous experiences.  After 3 months I'm very pleased with this purchase.- Super thin form slides very easily into the laptop sleeve on my backpack- No noisy hard drive!  It's basically silent.- Battery life is fantastic!.  I watched Stand Up Guys last week on a flight and I had nearly 5 hours left when the movie was over.- Ridiculous battery standby time means I can get by if I forget to plug it in a night.- Runs much cooler than my Macbook pro.Quite honestly I can't think of anything I dislike about this laptop.  It fits my needs perfectly for internet and media.  I'm confident this machine will serve me well over the next 3-4 years.::Travis L "Travis L"::5.0::January 30, 2013
R2XISAPAWNOQNW::9 second boot.  9.  Holy wow!::I've never been a Mac guy; I have issues with the "closed system" model. I work in a computer shop as a tech and I see a lot of computers.  However, we got a new MacBook Air in the other day to set up for a client.  It has a nine-second boot. Nine seconds from "Off" to your login screen. I have never before seen a nine second boot.  That's faster than a camel with a roman candle in it's ass.  I have put aside my issues with Apple.Build quality is excellent, though it is missing a network port and requires a $30 adapter if you want to hardwire to the internet.  Unlike early models, this one has a Thunderbolt port so you can connect it to another computer in Target Disk Mode.  That's important. Also, unlike early models, it has an SSD, which is apparently very fast.  2 USB3 ports make it very well-rounded; a lot of ultrabooks are still using USB2.I've seen a number of netbooks and ultrabooks, but this one is the fastest, by far.  If you're a Windows guy, like me, you can run Parallels or VMWare Fusion.  Cost is a little higher than you'll find in a comparable ultrabook, and if you actually need to fix something on it, you're in trouble.  These are damn near impossible to disassemble by anyone other than Apple; I knocked off a star rating for that.  But, if you've got the bread and need a really fast, powerful mini-computer, you really can't go wrong with this.  Get the 3-year Apple Care Warranty and sell it after 3 years.::James Lyford::4.0::December 16, 2012
R1Q25PFY0ZH3BJ::Ultraportable, yet powerful::I have had this for about 3 months now and have become quite attached to it. It is actually quite fast, thanks to the intel i5 processor and the ssd.I mostly use this for school (ex: typing reports, surfing the web) and for light gaming, such as Call of Duty 4 (I average around 60 fps, a decent frame rate for a laptop without a discrete graphics card.).Pros:1. good touchpad2. fast hard drive3. light and portable4. decent battery life (about 5.5 hours)5. easy to type keyboardCons:1. not enough USB ports (only 2, I would prefer 3 or more)2. sometimes crashes when it is in sleep mode3. gets very hot in the back when gaming4. sound comes from the keyboard, so when you put a keyboard cover beware of mufflingOverall, the pros outweigh the cons, making this laptop a keeper!::mudkipfluffy::5.0::November 3, 2012
R1VB6IBOCL90M0::There's a reason ultrabooks are being measured against the Air::I've been a PC user for nearly twenty years. This is my first Mac. The build quality is stand out, head and shoulders against comparably priced Ultrabooks. The OS is simple and user friendly. Amazing battery life, I'm getting six hours under pretty heavy use and I can't believe it. I feel liberated from the charger! The trackpad has to be mentioned- I typically hate trackpads because they get in the way while typing, often causing my cursor to jump into the wrong place and screwing things up- not this one. The gestures are a huge plus and make navigating the system a breeze. The display is bright and very clear. HD movies look excellent. You can game on this at low settings. I've tried Diablo 3 and can confirm that it does run well on reasonable settings. If you're looking for an ultrabook style computer look no further.::J. Silvia::5.0::October 27, 2012
RU5OE5AV3F21Y::Good enough to keep me hooked::Not thrilled but happy.  Replaced an older MB Pro 13" with this one (also 13").  Just got the least expensive option I could live with that would keep me in a mac.  Feels like I am addicted to macs and beginning to notice they really aren't a great value yet I can't even believe how awful the windows experience is in comparison, so here I am.  Being a mac person is expensive but has saved me countless hours as an instructor and student due to superior handling of PDFs, better index searches, and stability.Pros:Very light and thin of coursevery fast doing basic tasksmigration was completely painless with time machine, done in a few minutes with nothing lostrelated to the migration, I don't need a cd drive because all the apps I previously installed from disk transferred overcreates MUCH less heat then the MB pro I hadgreat battery lifeusb ports one on each side, my old one had too little space between themCons:Screen has less vivid color than my previous machinefonts tend to be smaller than I prefer because of the high pixel count and same size screen I had before, so the fonts did in fact get smallernot much computing power for $1100wish it had firewire port, but will live withoutI always feel like I will break it, but probably just that - a feeling::BrianJH::4.0::September 3, 2012
R15BU80F0SWQM7::Low battery::I bought two of these, one for me and one for my daughter. The computer has a nice design and is user friendly. However, the most critical aspect of a laptop is being able to function for a long time even when you are away from a power source. In this regard, this laptop fails miserably. My battery lasts for 2-2.5 hours only. It is so annoying that I had to buy a portable Hyperjuice battery. So now I have to carry this relatively light laptop together with a heavy portable battery. Ridiculous!!!::TomP::2.0::November 30, 2012
R2FHECU9IZAH1Y::Quite an ultra Ultrabook!::The current "Ivy Bridge" Macbook Air line is hard to find fault with.  As long as you keep the SSD configuration at 128GB it's not significantly different in price from a comparable quality ultra book on any OS.  If you want a precision metal case, long battery life, and a fairly hi-res display (1440x900 on the 13-inch model) in under 3 pounds you're looking at $1200+ on Windows too.Having USB 3.0 now is nice since hard drive sustained transfer speeds have long outpaced USB 2.0 and Firewire.  If you're planning to use virtualization like VMWare 5 or Parallels I recommend going with the 8GB RAM option which only adds $100 to the price.Note that you can't change anything in this computer yourself - hard drive nor memory, and there's no optical drive so buy what you think you'll need even if eventually.  For those so-inclined, the battery is user-replaceable after your warranty runs out but that's all that may ever find its way onto the table.  There's no wired ethernet on this model but you can get an external gigabit interface for about $30.  The built-in Wifi works on 2.4 and 5 GHZ and maxes out at 300Mbps because it has two antennas.Compared to my previous Macbook Pro 13-inch, this provides about twice the computing power using half the energy (=almost no heat) and 1/3 less weight.  An optical drive isn't something I think many people get much use out of any more so giving it up wasn't a sacrifice.In daily use it barely gets warm, the lit keyboard feels great, the sound is good - especially considering how thin this computer is, and the trackpad works great and doesn't ever make your cursor jump while you're typing.  Battery life is excellent at around 7 hours.  I'm not necessarily a fan of Apple the corporation, but I am a fan of great quality hardware and a solid UNIX-based OS.::WhatsTheHurry?::5.0::September 30, 2012
R29N0SESWW9S9L::Game Changer::I got my MacBook Air about 2 weeks ago now, and I haven't looked back!  I have been a PC owner my whole life, and I can honestly say after having my MacBook Air for two weeks, that I have no idea why!  Everything feels so smooth and intuitive on the Mac OS X Mountain Lion (the Mac operating system).  The trackpad actions are amazingly responsive and extremely intuitive.  This helps to increase productivity and is just a lot of fun to play with!I bought this computer to use while at Law School, and I can honestly say that I made the right choice!  I bought Microsoft Office for Mac, and it works great-just like the PC edition that I've been accustomed to.  Overall, this is the best computer I think any student could own.  Weighing in at around 2.5 lbs, it is super lightweight, ultraportable, and it looks and works great!  The display on the 13" MacBook Air actually has a higher resolution rate than the 13" MacBook Pro.  This is great news because it actually has a clearer picture, and the increased resolution means that you have a bigger workspace!  Furthermore, the battery on this computer is amazing!  You can easily get 6-7 hours off a single charge, probably a lot longer if you are working in a well-lit area (so you can turn down the brightness).  Another one of my favorite features is the back-lit keyboard.  It makes it great to use in low-light.  The built in web cam takes great pictures and videos, and FaceTime is included with OS X Mountain Lion, which is a great way to video call your friends and family members!Now for the fun stuff: The MacBook Air just looks amazing.  It is AMAZINGLY thin!  It is literally thinner than your standard spiral notebook!  You might think that means the MacBook Air is fragile, but you would be wrong!  The aluminum unibody is amazingly durable, and it feels very sturdy in your hand!  When I first began to look into purchasing a new computer, I put a great deal of weight into having a SSD (solid slate drive).  The SSD means that the hard drive for the computer does not move!  This is amazing because it virtually eliminates the need for a fan!  Which means, the MacBook Air never heats up (it gets a little warm, but nothing to worry about!), it is SUPER quiet (since there is not a fan always humming), and my absolute favorite fact is that the SSD means that there is very little chance of damage when transporting the MacBook AIr to and from class!  It is not going to be damaged from being shifted around precisely because there are virtually no moving parts within the MacBook Air.I spent months looking into which computer to buy for Law School, and I kept coming back to the MacBook Air.  There is a reason.  The MacBook Air was the trendsetter for all the Ultrabooks that now saturate the market.  Many of those ultrabooks are comparably priced, but none of them are as much of a complete package as the MacBook Air.  For the price, compared to similar computers on the market, the MacBook Air is truly the best of the bunch!::John Fraser::5.0::September 12, 2012
R1MS1YOJ1PAMQP::The Original Ultrabook::I recently purchased the 13" 2012 Macbook Air with 256GB hard drive. I've spent a good amount of time with it. These are my first impressions.Not surprisingly, the first thing I noticed was that it's very light weight. When you are traveling, and picking up and moving your laptop often, having something that's lightweight is appreciated.The next obvious characteristic is that it's very slim and compact. Unless you are fortunate enough to be flying business class, or first class, you'll be mobbed up with the rest of us average joes in coach class. There is little room on that tray table. I tried using a 15" alienware gaming laptop once on coach, and I made myself look the fool. This will fit within the confines of your crammed seat. Even if you're a lanky 6'1 guy like me.Battery life is excellent. If you are on an international flight, a flight with a layover, or on a long road trip or train ride, you will need every minute of battery life you can get. This will net 5-7 hours depending on what you're doing, and how low you can tolerate the screen brightness being.Shutdown, Boot up, sleep, and awake times are blazing, blazing fast. Perhaps the fastest of any commercial grade laptop? This is good for a laptop because you may very well find yourself using the laptop in small spurts of time, and you'll need to put it in sleep, and wake it up more often than you would a desktop machine.Another great thing is the solid state drive. This is what gives the Air it's long battery life, and its impossibly sleek dimensions, but the great thing about solid state hard drives is that they are much more reliable than optical hard drives, especially in laptops, where they experience drops, shock, and impact more than desktops. Even a minor bump has the capability to put an optical hard drive out of commission.I remember having original iPods that had optical hard drives, and I always had problems with them. I have owned every iPod Touch generation since its first release, and not one has ever had a hard drive issue, since they all use solid state storage.So you have all these great features that lend themselves well to the purposes of a laptop. The keyboard is the best I have ever used on a laptop. Keys are well spaced, and have a crisp feel. Typing is super accurate, and the adjustable backlit keys are a welcome feature to a nightowl like myself. The track pad is HUGE. I couldnt ask for any more real estate, and I have unusually long fingers too.I spent some time learning all of the trackpad gestures, and once you learn them, web surfing, file browsing, and viewing pictures will be faster, and more pleasant. I love being able to swipe instead of pressing my browsers forward and back button. When I go to a website that has tiny text, I pinch out, and increase the font size quickly and effortlessly. I rely on clicking and scrolling on a mouse less. You accomplish tasks faster.The screen is sharp, vibrant, and gorgeous. The brightness level goes high, which you will need if you ever use it outdoors on a sunny day. But make sure to set the brightness as low as you can if you are running on the battery.The laptop is as quiet as a ninja in the night. When doing basic tasks like web browsing, or listening to iTunes, or viewing pictures, its near silent. When you are running hardware intensive programs or 3D gaming, the fan starts going, but it is still pretty quiet.Even though it has integrated graphics, this laptop is still capable of running some pretty good looking modern games at moderate settings. You can run Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, Battlefield 3, MW3, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Assassins Creed on medium settings with acceptable framerates. To me, that's impressive for a super thin laptop that doesn't have a dedicated GPU.I considered the Macbook Pro because of it's more powerful specs, but in the end, i'm confident that i'll be happier with the Air. The performance meets my needs, and the sleekness, lightweight, style, and lower price give it the edge.I have used retina displays on the iPad and iPod Touch, and I know how gorgeous it is, but still there arent very many OSX apps and websites that utilize the retina display, so I don't feel that I am missing much. Plus the Retina display demands more power, and that means more battery consumption. Still, this non retina display is still sharp and beautiful.If I absolutely needed a macbook with the best hardware, I would have chose the Pro, but for my needs, the Air handles the things I need.As far as downsides go, I like the previous magsafe power adapter better. It was thinner, and less prone to accidentally being disconnected.Like all of Apple's computers, the price isn't cheap. I can't say that you're getting a bargain. But i'm willing to pay more for a good product. I think it's worth the price. And it helps that Apple products have the best resale value of any electronics brand.I don't know how tough and durable the laptop is, since I haven't dropped it, or used it in harsh conditions for long periods of time, but I have had good luck with macs in the past. No serious hardware failures so far. And I love the aluminum enclosure, which is stronger, feels better, and is much more classy than your typical plastic bodied laptops.This is what a laptop should be!::the Lorax::5.0::August 10, 2012
ROGUFBMQU1WQQ::Everything I Need::I'm a college student, and a writer, and this computer is absolutely perfect for me. There is plenty of memory and power for things I do because it's really just writing, surfing the web, using iPhoto on occasion, and using Spotify. If you were a graphic designer or video editor, this might not have enough power for you, but I've done a bit of video editing in iMovie on this, and it worked really well, and didn't slow down at all. And since I'm ususally taking my computer to class, or other places to write, the light weight is so much easier on my shoulders when it's in my backpack as opposed to the old black macbook I had. All in all, it's the perfect computer for someone whose not doing giant loads of complex work. And even then I think it would still do very well.::Samuel Claney::5.0::August 6, 2012

R2BWSOQCZQHB6T::My favorite::Best laptop I have ever owned. Hands down. That's it. I've had custom built HPs, Dells, ASUSsss?, and others; but this has by far been the best. It has just enough of everything, and nothing you don't (Dramatic head tilt and stare at you Mr. HP Fingerprint reader). I really like the backlit keyboard, multi touch trackpad, and the actual display and hardware itself. I have never used this mac and thought "man, if only it had a little more". Having owned the old model 11" and now this 13" for quite a while I can say after everyday use and carry they are the best mobile laptop on the market.::thatoneguy::5.0::January 13, 2014
RP79IVKBPI1N8::airbook::I won this in a contest. I much prefer tablets for daily use away from home, but this is nearly as compact and light as my I pad, but slightly more functional. I was in the market for a Macbook pro, but think this might be a better choice. I have not once wished for a drive for cd or dvd.::Russell White::5.0::January 12, 2014
R1CSMMBWKJ8UDF::disappointed::After a year of using the computer primarily for productivity (using basic applications) it started to fall apart. Keys have fallen out and the battery stopped about 7 months in. Fan has been replaced three times from Apple. They've been incredibly nice at Apple Support but this computer has had so many issues.::Random User::1.0::December 23, 2013
R1SOFK83E87Y72::Like it::I got this computer a couple month ago, it is really good.  The only problem is sometimes the double click don't work very well.  This is only happen once a while, I need to figure out what caused this problem.  But overall, it is really good, light and beautiful.::Limei.pranke::4.0::December 22, 2013
R3DEMVT1D0ZIK7::As expected::Upgraded from a 11" model for more screen space and larger hard drive.  Easily migrated from the old Mac Book air to the new one using the migration assistant.  All data, applications, email and even vmware ported over very easily::Kenneth Payne::4.0::September 15, 2013
R204H03SWTLAY3::Good price::When I know the new model is announced, I jumped on the old model and save hundreds of dollar.Why pay more for little bit performance increase??? This is exactly what I need...Again, you need to keep checking the price daily, Amazon change their price almost everyday!!!::Lala Land::5.0::August 26, 2013
R2LT5WEQ7FIR9G::Love this Macbook::I have had this macbook for almost a year and I love it. The macbook air is very lightweight and I love the aluminum case design. The speed is very fast due to flash storage. The macbook air boots up and shuts down quickly. The trackpad is made with glass and is extremely smooth. The battery life is amazing often getting 7 hours on a single charge. I also like the backlit keyboard and the high resolution on the screen making things extremely clear to see. Overall this is a great buy and is better than all of the laptops I've previously had.::Kevin "Kevin"::5.0::August 23, 2013

R17ZA1DZIFZF07::The ultimate computer.::There is not a computer on the market that can match the Macbook Air. It has an outstanding battery life, crazy fast speeds, and brilliant display.I have owned PC after PC and they all pail in comparison to this beautiful machine.Here are a couple of pros and cons:PROS- up to 12 hours of battery life- incredible screen quality (mine displays better than my 24 inch HD work PC)- quite and cool (no noisy fan always blowing and sending a wall of heat barreling towards your crotch)- insanely fast (This is due to the 4 gigs of ram and the solid state drive)- lightweight, yet sturdyCONS- lightweight (This is also a con because it does take some getting used to)- No disk drive (This is easily fixed by purchasing a USB super drive or using dropbox)- No way to add more ram or change the battery (This is really not a big deal to me. I am happy with the default setup)The fact is eveytime I purchase a Mac, it ends up living for 6 to 8 years. Here is my equation for purchasing a computer:Computer's Value = aComputer's Lifespan = bTotal cost per year = ca/b = cI gave my last mac away at 7 years old and it lasted another year until a glass of water was spilled on it...Equation: $1000/8That comes out to $125.00 per year. Try that out with any P.O.S asus, acer, or hp brand you have owned and see if yours does better. I am going to make a guess: no.::j05hua::5.0::August 23, 2013

R238XW5Q8BOKB0::Best computer I have ever owned::This is my first Apple computer and without a doubt the best computer I have ever owned!  The keyboard feels amazing - I actually type faster and more accurately.  The variable keyboard backlighting is also great.  The trackpad actually does what I tell it too (imagine scrolling without fighting your computer!), the display is great, speakers are surprisingly good, wakes up almost as fast as an iOS device for quick note taking, and the App Store has great free or inexpensive utilities (like Better Snap Tool so you can easily do the half-screen split introduced in Windows 7, but better, of PDF Toolbox Star for splitting up and combining PDF documents without having to buy Adobe Acrobat Pro).  Office 2011 works great and is more stable than Windows versions of Office.  In the future I may switch to iWork, we'll so how that progresses.  SolidWorks ran better on this using VMWare Fusion than on campus Windows machines.  The battery life is just unreal and doesn't die unexpectedly - you always know exactly how much charge you have left.  iMovie and GarageBand are excellent bonuses (I don't do photo editing so I can't speak for iPhoto).  Having iMessage on here is fantastic and it does FaceTime amazingly.  One of my absolute favorite things is getting frequent and meaningful OS updates and NEVER having my computer shut down on me because stupid Windows update doesn't shut down my computer in the middle of working on something.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get over that, I'm sure you'll never want to go back either.  I also recommend getting an external hard drive for backup (about $70 for an awesome 1.5TB pocket hard drive with USB 3.0) and since the 128GB isn't that big anyway.  You know you should be doing backups anyway, right?  Files transfers are often instantaneous when using a USB 3.0 ready hard drive.  Buy a MacBook Air!::B. Rowberry::5.0::July 22, 2013
RQ5J8K1E93CF8::Best computer in my opinion::First off this is pretty cheap for a MBA. I got this computer to use for college and it is amazing. It super light, so carrying it from class to class is a breeze. I have been using Microsoft products for a while and it is really easy to figure a mac out. At this point i have absolutely no complaints about this products but i would recommend buying a usb hub (which are extremely cheap) I am a college student i would recommend this.::JA "G0d!sL0ve"::5.0::June 12, 2013

R19OCHD9P8DW40::My new favorite travel buddy::This laptop is my new best friend. I travel a LOT and bring my laptop with me so that I can work on the road. I had NO IDEA how heavy my old Macbook Pro was until this arrived. OMG, travel is beyond easy, I can seriously just slip this into my purse and go. I've been using it for months now, and can say it only bothered me that there's no cd port ONCE. But not enough to purchase one. Switching from a Macbook Pro to a Macbook Air was WAY easier than I imagined and I'm super glad I made the jump.::meggyfin::5.0::May 31, 2013

I've made some adjustments and will play with it some more.  I don't use it everyday, but the battery seems to last quite well. Other than the display, I am very satisfied with the laptop.::Carol Harrison::4.0::May 3, 2013
R21YYXQVAIJ35G::Love my MACBOOK::I absolutely love this macbook air! This is my first macbook and I will never go back to pc. It works so well, quickly, and has really long battery life! I bought mine at best buy and have had it for a few weeks. My only con is that the power cord comes out to easily for personal preference. However, since the battery life is amazing this is rarely a problem.::Amazon Customer::5.0::May 2, 2013
RMS2X5H3444PW::Very efficient and complete::I have always had personally chosen Apple computers since the first Classic model.

R3H03UFSB366HP::It just makes sense::I got the Yoga 13 from Lenovo and the Macbook Air 13, and I have used them for 6 months.  The Yoga 13 is ok, or "good", but the Macbook Air is the machine I *love*.  Everything makes sense.  It is light, quiet, the speakers are very good, the screen very good, the keyboard is very good.  It is one of the best computers I have used since 1982, for 31 years.  The PCs I have used, I may give the best one an 8.5 score out of 10.  And the Macbook Air, it is simply a 9.5 or above.::Epsilon Delta::5.0::April 27, 2013

It has a good enough video card, but the rest suits me perfectly. I had a few crashes on my mail app, but it's ok. It runs smooth, no fan noise, no blue screen. I have no cons for this product, just pros::Cozma alex::5.0::April 20, 2013
R2NUREGKP6G2DA::nice improvements::I used to have a 2010 model and it made an annoying sound when it was hot after using it for 2 hours. With this version I've had no problems I just wish it had lion so I wouldnt have to pay for it. One other thing that makes it perfect to buy it on Amazon is that there are no taxes at least in my area.::Miguel::5.0::April 15, 2013
R3CHGB1ZNDHD3N::Excellent example of the proper notebook::I like my MacBook Air and I'm ready to recommend it for every person who needs fast, durable and stylish notebook for work and for life. I use it for all my working tasks in the office. It's my eternal satellite. It's weight is very low, so it's convinient to carry it everyday without a problems. I like to control it with gestures touching my touchpad and it's really easy to do all you want with MacBook.My next notebook will be just only MacBook.::DZMITRY SLAUNIKAU::5.0::April 13, 2013

R2W3SIHGW6BPSG::Almost perfect. Could use a better display.::Ultra portable, solid casing. Very fast and snappy. Amazing battery life, unless you use Skype or flash video too much.SSD speed is worth the limited disk space, at least for my usage. I recommend to consider buying a portable hard drive in case you don't have one to solve that limitation.Display is not as good as other Apple products, probably because it is a non-retina LCD without IPS technology, but it isn't too bad.Speakers sound flaky, but listening to music isn't the standard usage of an ultra portable anyway, and yet sound quality when using headphones is very good.::Matías Javier Rossi::5.0::February 26, 2013
R1AFF0FFBTI974::The BEST computer I ever had::I have the newest version of MacBook Air for more than a year now.It is the second MacBook Air after the previous version (the white plastic one, which used to get really hot after a couple of hours).This version of MacBook Air is lightweight, fast, has a long battery life, starts-up instantaneously, great WiFi, big enough screen, high rez , never gets too hot and is also stylish with the slim looks.The only downside being the lack of CD/DVD, but first I don't use them anymore and second - you can always add an external device if you must.It will not be an exaggeration to say the MacBook Air is the best computer I ever had.::Toren::5.0::February 22, 2013
R165I07IKO2DYV::Excellent::This product at first was a little difficult to use and i wanted to return it, but i decided to keep it, but then on 2/18 i notice one of the keys was loose. I got on line and said i wanted to exchange it, low and behold today 2/19/ ups was at my door with my replacement laptop. LOVE IT, EXCELLENT SERVICE, wouldn't trade for any other laptop, it's worth the price.

R3P18K9HN4SCRW::Perfect Portable::This laptop feels orders of magnitude more powerful than my 2008 13 inch aluminum MacBook. And It feels like a feather in the hands compared to the old laptop too. The new Os is snappy and plays well with the multi-touch track pad.Keep an external disc drive at home and call it a day because this is all the laptop most people need and will keep you happy.::Gary Hays::5.0::January 29, 2013
R2FMDBRROCZ0ST::One of purchases that i can never regret.::I bought two of these. My husband wanted to give one to his brother and his wife and one for us. We are laptopoholics and have manyyyyyy laptops and comppyters at home ( partly because we have a software business and need to test our software on different paltforms) Anyway, these are our first APPLE computers and all of us are loving this....this is extremely lightweight and fast and good looking. I am a little unhappy with the battery life, it drains out a little faster than our other laptops(dell,HP etc)but anyway, It is an amazing laptop and since we got it on a deal I dont think we will regret this decision :) Love amazon !::SHSO::5.0::January 29, 2013

R2RXQT0W4BNI36::Awesome::Incredible Mac.  I have owned Mac's since 1984 and this one is just too good.  It's lightweight, fast and compact.  I use it for business since I travel often.  The compact size makes it easy to travel with and I now play movies on the airplane on it instead of my iPad.  Since I acquired the 13" Mac I don't need to travel with a computer and iPad.::Lynn Charles Wright::5.0::January 27, 2013

All in all, no complaints.::Peter::5.0::January 8, 2013
R11WV0JHN6A4IJ::Truly Amazing::This was a gift for my nephew. He is only 8 but very smart. I wanted a powerful notebook but something light and small for him. The MacBook Air being an apple product, I knew would be 5 star quality. The fit and finish is first class all the way. The huge plus and why I am writing the review is that a 13.3" laptop is under 3 lbs with 7 hours of battery life. What other company puts out a product even close for only $1100? The use of the solid state drive is a big plus in this price range and did I mentiion a 13.3" screen and under 3lbs. I now want one for myself.::Gadget Lover::5.0::January 5, 2013
R3E0BSTW04XG0M::Love my Macbook Air!::This is a very easy-to-use laptop. I work in IT (primarily with PC's) and am loving the fun and easy to use aspects of the Mac products.::L. Burns::5.0::December 27, 2012
RCJFXCLE0YB3O::Bad ass::So I was really hesitant between the air and the pro. I have owned multiples of each. The cons of the air is that what ram you get, you keep you can cannot add more. Also the battery can not be swapped at home, unlike the pro. After monitoring my usage I found 4GB of ram would be adequate. I only do very minor music and video editing. The added cost of apples ram isn't so bad but you can't get it via amazon (saving discount plus taxes)The computer is itself is like everything apple designs. Beautiful and elegant. My MacBook Pro took multiple falls from 4 feet onto concrete. One time with the screen open, kitting the screen and bottom at the same time. Multiple battle scars a bad battery and 4 years later it still sold for 550$ on eBay! Beat that pcs. You just can't loose with apple::Spencer::5.0::December 24, 2012
R10UK6IOT7OEZI::Good laptop my kid just loves it::Bought this on black Friday at very good price. My high school kid was looking for a thin laptop, so I just grabbed it when I saw it on sale.  My kid loves the iMovie as he has been using it to make YouTube video (channel J4FP2).  This laptop is lighter than any Windows ultrabook on the market and the built and finish is unbeatable.  I see other manufacturers are copying its design (e.g Samsung).  I tried the Windows 8 laptop and its just confusing.  The touch screen may look cool at first sight, but not sure how much useful it is in practice.  It may get confused at times.  The other reason I bought the Mac is to avoid any virus issue down the road, I don't want to be technical support for my kid.  I think you will like it.::D. Wong::5.0::December 24, 2012
RI9KG1XV41HRF::Lightweight and awesome!::I decided to purchase a MacBook Air after my 5-year old MacBook started to become too slow, I hope it lasts as long as my previous one. The computer is very light, very beautiful and the battery life is amazing! I can use it all day without needing to charge. As advertised, it wakes up from sleep mode almost instantly. I use Microsoft office seamlessly and love the OS, everything works well and is plug and play right out of the box! Will definitely buy another mac when this one gets old as well!::sexysherri::5.0::December 22, 2012
R2D4IN6EFJMEDG::A perfect laptop for developers::No doubt this is rated as #1 laptop this year, fast, sleek and light weight. I Can't ask for more!With i5 processor, 4 GB RAM and 128 SSD it's really fast!::Gourav::5.0::December 5, 2012
R2C12NEPT6UZ0U::MAC book Air is all that it calimed::The computer is light, fast and easy to use.  The only drawback is one which is known from the outset for Microsoft users and that is the fact that you have to employ an additional step or two to get the programs to run.  But that was no surprise and the facility and response available from the MAC Air makes it a true pleasure to use.::Steven Beers::5.0::December 4, 2012
R24SJRV392O1V0::First Time Mac User is Happy!::I have always been a PC user but have wanted to switch to a Mac for a couple of years, just didn't have the money.  This year has been more successful in my business so I started saving and saw this was on sale (I had always heard Macs don't go on sale) and with free shipping and no tax it was a better buy than purchasing locally.  The computer was shipped in the time frame specified and exactly as described.The Migration Assistant program to migrate my PC to this Mac did not work and after several calls to tech support (I must say Apple has the best tech support I've ever talked to) and a trip to an Apple store, I finally gave up and had a computer guru I know come over to copy my files and such from my PC to my Mac.  Once this was done, I was ready to go and have now been using my Mac for three days and love it!  I now know why I've heard so many people say "Once you go Mac you'll never go back".It is different than a PC in many ways but so far has been easy to adjust to.  Probably helps that I already had an iPhone so was somewhat familiar with the Apple interface.The computer itself is so sleek and compact, much lighter in weight and size than my old laptop and keys have a nice touch.I can now say I am a Mac user and happy.::Meli S "Melissa"::5.0::August 23, 2012
R1EY59KTKGHEKI::Apple MacBook Air MD231LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)::Super fast with free upgrade to Mountain  Lion. SSD allows one second boot up. Gestures take a while to get used to but then are a natural thing. Very light and portable.::mikeb::5.0::July 28, 2012
R3NJ4NBBS6CZQO::Decent computer but constant issues with display::Overall this laptop is ok.  Its fast and easy to use but I have had some issues with the screen. I have had it about 6 months now and the screen had a bright spot develop near the bottom of the screen that was really distracting.  After I could not stand it anymore, I took it in to the Apple store to have it looked at.  They replaced the screen but it took them a week to do it.  When I got it back, the screen was badly misaligned when the laptop was closed so after I complained about it they tried several more times to fix it.  Finally they had to replace the screen again but it was still not aligned properly like it was when I purchased it.  They then told me it was all they could do and they would not do any more to fix it.  The technician said It was a common problem but only cosmetic so I am out of luck.  I though Apple products were supposed to be higher quality than this.  My wifes cheapo budget laptop has a better screen and its aligned properly.  She makes fun of me for wasting my money to but this one.  I am not really impressed with the quality of the product or service at this point.  Way overpriced for what you get.Other than that, it still works reasonably well.  I do like that its light and thin.  Its also pretty fast thanks to the SSD.  Not sure I will buy a Mac again though after this experience.  I do like the Mac OSX though, just not impressed with the hardware.  I might just have to make a hackintosh after this one.I am an IT specialist and have experience with a great deal of different computers and laptops and I can say there is nothing special about this one.  Should have spent my money on a more powerful windows laptop instead for the same price.::Taylor::3.0::January 10, 2013
R3RUO0EXY2U334::beautiful computer but too small::This is a beautiful computer. It is thin, light, does not overheat. No radiation heat headache or skin burn from this computer. You don't even miss the disk drive. When you think about it, everything is downloaded now. Disks are not used that often, and when they are needed, there is the option of an inexpensive external disk drive.It's simply an amazing computer. Turns on in seconds when you gently tap the button. Super fast. Quiet. I can't say enough good things about this computer. I love it but needed to return it because the print was very small and not adjustable in some areas. The toolbar print is ridiculously small and not adjustable. Web text is adjustable. But for me, no matter how many times I changed the font or adjusted the resolution, my eyesight was not good while using this.I also found I was needing an extra port that was not there. No big deal. The positive definitely outweighs any small amount of negative with this computer and it will be great for anyone that uses it. This is the perfect travel computer. I did not want to return it, but I just felt it was too small. I'm really hoping apple will release a 15" Macbook Air. I love the design of this computer I just wish they offered a larger screen size.::Danielle::3.0::June 29, 2012

R11X9UDDNXKGWK::The MacBook Air is ideal for anyone.::The MacBook Air is more than it appears to be. The thinness of the Mac is very useful. As a college student, I constantly need a computer that I can slip into a small space and take out again when needed. The Mac Air definitely fits this need. Also, the MacBook Air starts up very quickly. This is very helpful anywhere, especially in college. You can quickly open you Mac and take notes with no delay.My Mac Air has never frozen as so many other brands often do. I have never had any complaint about it. It has served me well. This computer supplies all needs that I have as a student. However, it is also very useful for many other areas. Its thin frame and light body make it a computer like no other.  I definitely recommend this Mac for anybody, regardless of what they need it for.::jhdmbd::5.0::May 10, 2013
R19SS2XI04NET4::More than Applesauce::The Air is just that, air.  It's sooo light and easy to handle.  Screen has great resolution and it's fast.  Being a long time (and old) PC user, it's taking a while to learn the power of this new OS, but getting there.  Still, all in all, the MacBook Air was a good idea.::Robert Randle::4.0::March 20, 2013
R6V4RSSTF1KRY::Greatest computer ever!::I have owned several laptops but this one surpasses all of them. I like everything about this computer. I can't think of anything that I don't like. I would recommend this computer for anyone. Wish  the price was less but its worth every penny. I checked all the stores & I got a better price from Amazon than any other store.::Helen Turner::5.0::March 16, 2013
R5OSUWVP1DUOL::awesome,but....::I very much enjoy my air. It is very fast and weighs virtually nothing. The draw back is the audio. It is not loud at all. i recommend buying headphones or speakers. I also have a problem of closing the laptop and it restarts and i sometimes lose my programs. I recommend a case and warranty because they scratch and get dirty easily.::allenp::4.0::March 14, 2013

R3MYEN8PU8VK6H::WARNING - READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY APPLE::If you are purchasing an Apple computer for ease of use and a super user-friendly GUI, go ahead and push "BUY IT NOW".  But if you are migrating over to Apple to take advantage of the apparent bargains to be found in the professional software arena (Music Production, Video Production, Graphic Arts, etc.) I am issuing a warning that Apple is lying to you.  Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.  If you are buying Apple to take advantage of these apparent deals...save your money and stick with a PC.  You will pay more initially for your software, but within a year you will be saving money.::Frank Erfurth::2.0::September 5, 2013

R2ACCCYE7484W3::Mac Book Air 13.3 inch laptop::I purchased two of these at Christmas.  I really love these Laptops!.  They are very well made!.  They are easy to set up, do not crash, they're fast and a joy to use.  I can not beleive that Apple can put this much computer in a package as light and powerful as this.  Just to be clear on a couple of things, I and my family are long time users of DOS/ Windows operating based computers.  We all know that with a windows based poerating system, the user is always having to "fiddle" with a setting, defrag, clean up or tune up the system.  This does not seem to be the case with these Apple units. In fact I also own an I phone and the Air Port extreme, all with no issues.  I purchased a Mac Laptop for a family member ten years ago.  To this day it has not had the first hardware or software issue.  I have another family member that purchased a desk top and an I pad at the same time and again, not one issue.  I might add that when I purchaced the Mac Book Air, I was on my third Dell during the time the one family member was on and still is on the first Laptop.  This is what I have learned from this purchace.1.  Apple, well done on the MacBook Air!2. Apple, well done on the AirPort Extreme!3. Apple, well done on the I phone!  I have the 4S.4. For those of you who for some reason like to bash Apple, well...... grow up.  I watched other people use their products for years before I ever purchased the first Apple product.5. I would never ever buy another computer  that did not have a SSHD.  It makes a world of differance6. I have never had a lap top that will run seven hours continuiously off of one battery charge.  This Mac Book Air will do that.7.  I installed Office Mac on two Mac Book Airs, and I have not had any issues.Anyone looking at a laptop, should take a serious look at Apple's offerings.  Like me, you may be asking yourself why you had not made the switch sooner.  Again I say, Well done Apple!::Warren Horne::5.0::February 4, 2013

Defeats the purpose.  Otherwise, the laptop is GREAT.  Super fast processing and with the Solid State is awesome.::Benjamin H Randolph::3.0::January 22, 2013

RRKOFJ5598AAP::Love it!!!!::I was very hesitant about buying the 128GB Air.  I originally bought a MB Pro but within a 2 week time frame I had to take it in to the Apple Store twice.  The last time I said I'm done..  Returned it to Amazon then bought the Air.  I do LOVE it!  I love the portability factor and how speedy it is.  I don't think i'd ever go back to a MB Pro after this.::Big Jimmy::5.0::November 7, 2012
R2XB3Z6Y7JAB1P::I really should have switched to Macs earlier::I am a long-time windows user and this is my first Mac. I've decided to switch to macs because of 1) extremely good experience with iPhones and iPads (I admit they are not perfect, but they are by far the best package I've tried, and I used to be very into gadgets until I started using iPhone/ iPad); 2) saw my roommate using it and was really impressed by the battery life and the size.It's my first week owning it and so far, all I can say is, wow... Mac is just so easy to use! I'm usually pretty good with computers, and by using all the shortcuts and gestures of the trackpad, using the laptop is just such a pleasurable experience!I recommend this 2012 Macbook Air whole-heartedly to anyone who's looking into a portable laptop (as opposed to a workstation, gaming gig, etc).::CostBenefitAnalysis::5.0::August 23, 2012
RAF4OOV0E4RRX::Best ultrabook on the market::I was looking for a replacement for my big 15" laptop and decided to go for an ultraportable this time around. I like the brute power and screen resolution of larger laptops, but have seen new ultrabooks that rival those in even those areas. That sold me, especially coupled with the fact that I'm tired of carrying around a 6+ pound machine.Most consider Apple to be a premium, expensive but aesthetically-pleasing brand, and in most respects they are. However, at this point in time the MacBook Air 13" is really not a bad deal from a hardware standpoint. I did a lot of looking and spec-reading, and it simply looked the best from a cost/performance standpoint. The fact that it looks cool and is Apple branded is just icing on the cake. My next choice was the high-end ASUS Zenbook. Toshiba and HP's offerings also caught my eye, but were all clearly deficient in at least one area (usually CPU) in order to boost battery life. I understand the tradeoff, but I'd rather have 10% more CPU power than 10% more battery life.In comparison to the Zenbook, the Mac Air has a smaller capacity SSD for equivalent price, and slightly lower resolution screen. However, it's got a faster processor and SSD. I'll admit that the last one is a bit subjective since they're both pretty fast and are running different operating systems, but that is my judgment based on familiarity with Win 7 and OS X 10.7 boot times on similar hardware. What decided it for me hardware-wise was the keyboard. The Mac Air has essentially the same keyboard as the 15" Mac Pro, and it's probably the best laptop keyboard ever made. The Zenbook... well, it's different. I guess some might not mind it, but I kind of do. Additionally, the 256 vs 128 GB of SSD space is not a significant difference the way I look at it. If I'm going to be storing massive files like videos, I'd use an external USB 3 HDD anyway, and 128 extra GB isn't going to make much difference (especially when you factor in how much larger Win 7 is than OSX).On that note, I'd say it's debatable whether OSX is better than Win 7 overall, and I still use the latter for games and such. However, if I'm not planning on running games I'd say there's little doubt that OSX is more streamlined for general tasks. That's what I'm using this machine for, so I count that a plus.Note- the 'good' one is the base 13" model. The stock 'high end' one is not a good deal, as all you get is a bigger SSD.Pros:Excellent keyboardOSX 10.7 and iLife (iMovie beats the snot out of Windows Movie Maker)Good performance with turbo-boost i5, GMA 4000 and 4 GB of RAM. Fast SSD.USB 3.0 for fast external data transferScreen has good resolution- better than 13" MBP and way better than any netbook.Cons:As with all ultrabooks, not easily modifiable or expandable.::Yu-jin Chia "Yu-Jin Chia"::5.0::July 14, 2012

R2XA43V3W89A2W::Fast and Light::Very please with this product. The SSD really shows its teeth even when comparing it to my Macbook Pro. The speed and portability of this Macbook Air is great, just what one needs if they need to be ultra portable or need something small. I was for a long time anti-Mac but after using them more for work and personal use, they really are great. They keep going, and keep going at the same rate they started at, quick, and efficient.::AK::5.0::January 22, 2013

R37S10NTES3HN4::First Mac Ever -- Will Never Buy A PC Again.::This is my first Mac ever. I love it. I have been a PC user for 20+ years. My work demands that I be on a computer 18 hours/day. My new Mac makes it soooooo much more enjoyable.It runs cool and silent. No moving parts! I am not sure why people say this unit is so fragile. They must be rough or clumsy in general. I baby ALL of my electronics. They all get covers and cases to protect them. I always treat my computers very carefully/cautiously.I've owned my Mac going on 8 months... and it is NOT a flimsy/fragile machine --  it is EXTREMELY lightweight! I can work from my lap all day long and hardly notice it.I LOVE IT! I also highly recommend getting yourself a clear, plastic shell. They run $15-$30. On an additional note, the lighted keyboard is very easy on old eyes.I also own an iPad and an iPhone... EVERYTHING is integrated seamlessly... all of my docs, memos, to-do's, etc. If I take a pic with my iPhone, it is transferred to my Mac automatically. Ditto for notes, docs, etc. What a concept!I will NEVER go back to Windows.... even Windows 8. I have it and... ugh. Never. Forget it. I'm sold 100% on the Mac.::Robert Hebron "Avid reader"::5.0::December 14, 2012

R2AFLVZKWBCS6::The best $1200 I've ever spent. Period.::Birthday was coming up and didn't really want to spend bday money on a computer for work. But, with my iBook getting really (really) old, I needed to upgrade. This thing is amazing. Super lite, super durable, SUPER fast, and super usable. About the flash drive - you really don't understand how much faster a flash drive makes a computer until you use one. My wife has a 2010 Macbook Pro and this thing blows it away as far as start-up, opening programs, etc. And despite not having a CD drive, you still have many options to make a CD/DVD. Because I have an old 2004 iBook and my wife has her MBP, I can "borrow" (through CD/DVD sharing) one of those drives to rip/play/burn a CD/DVD. I've already ripped a couple DVDs so far. This borrowing, though, only works with Macs. I also use Google Drive (can't stand iCloud) to store everything so that anything I do on my Air, I have available at my PC at the office.Didn't want to spend the money, but SOOOO glad I did. Best present ever!!::J. Murphy::5.0::October 12, 2012
R2ZOEC4Z6LNC3K::Convert::I've always been a windows advocate; until now.  This UNIX based OS X platform is great.  Completely learned the system within a days time.

R2G21NZT8FV9V3::Good. But Battery?::When I first got it, everything's good, except for the battery life. 13", Wifi on, screen 30% and a few random applications. The estimated battery life is 5:33. It is less than the "Up to 7 hrs" as said on apple.com. And the MagSafe 2 is kind of loose.Besides that, everthing's good.Oh by the way, for those who would like to buy an SDHC card to expand the storage spaces(including myself, as they are so cheap): the Card does reach out around 1/3 to 1/2 of an inch from the slot, instead of completely hidden inside. (I used to have a HP and it's the hidden kind(with less than 1/8" hanging outside). You only need to push and the card would pop out. That's convenient.)And I do think this laptop looks kinda fragile and probable need a case or at least a good sleeve. I'm trying to find one, but it seems most case now would double the thickness of it, which means losing its one of the proudest advantages.::Andrew::5.0::July 23, 2012
RURDX4EHV4SBE::LOVE my new Macbook Air::We purchased this last week & I LOVE it! Up till now, I have had PC's. The Macbook is so much more streamlined & user friendly. Things just work, when you open the lid, it comes right up to the log in screen, no having to "wake it up". My iPhone connects seamlessly & I can easily download pictures from it to my Macbook. Connecting hardware, like my printer, was a snap. I just plugged it into my Macbook & it popped up a window asking me if I wanted to search for the drivers. I told it yes & it searched, downloaded & installed the printer in a matter of mins. It is light, but feels very durable. It has 2 USB ports, I've never needed more than 3. The power plug magnetizes to the computer, which is wonderful for me, I tend to have power plugs that fall out of computers. The bottom of the computer does not get hot because there are no any moving parts inside. We got the computer from an Apple store & bought the OneToOne service where you can go back in with your computer & have them teach you how to use it. I wasn't sure I would use the service, but there are SO many different things that you can do with the computer, that I recommend you get this service. I also love all the touch sensitive things you can do with the touchpad. SO much nicer than a regular PC. My husband, who wasn't convinced at first is now jealous & wants one for himself! Now I just have to find a cover that I like as much as I like the computer!::TiffPro::5.0::July 2, 2012
R12GODDAKC0YJE::Beautifully made, fast and easy to use, portable. Not as much customization, horrible battery life::The thing about Apple products is that you always need to buy more accessories just to PROTECT your product. I have had this item for about a day and I feel like I need a case and a sleeve for it. Then again, it is a very nice product, made to be displayed beautifully and its aesthetics were meant to be appreciated. With my previous windows laptop, I honestly did not care much for scratches and dents on its exterior surface. If you're paying close to or over a grand for something, you better make sure to take care of it.As far as functionality, the interface is easy to use, beautifully designed and breathtaking. I am being spoiled and I know it. There are a few more options that I would like available to customize my dock and folder options, but maybe I just need to do more research. The multifunction trackpad is heaven sent and if you are  a stickler for efficiency, the Mac will win you over.I found it a pleasure to work on this piece of art. It super light to carry around and the power cord isn't bulky and heavy, making it so much more portable than my old laptop.In conclusion, worth the investment.::kylie "kylie"::4.0::January 30, 2013
R15C28LL7JTS38::Repeat Customer::I once had a macbook pro 13" and lost it. I was determined to buy another since my God does apple make great computers. If you're reading this review, you probably already know all about macbooks and want to get one. This one is amazing for the price. I picked it up for $1020 tax-free (retail $1200) and couldn't be happier. Do yourself a favor and click the order button.::Pinetar321::5.0::November 26, 2012
RVEB4988AAKE4::Spend another $100 for 8GB of RAM::I bought my MBA direct because I knew from experience that investing an extra $100 to upgrade to 8GB of RAM was worth it. The extra RAM increases performance significantly. Other options not shown on this site are the 512GB SSD and a faster CPU.The last Mac I owned was the Macintosh II which cost $5500 in 1990. I own several PCs but having owned all 3 generations of the iPad got me spoiled as to instant on computing, so I thought I would try the new MBA.It's great, but I am still going through a learning curve on all the commands and operating system features.I did purchase the Level 8 case at the Apple store which is designed to carry both a 13" MBA and an iPad, plus it's TSA compatible, so you only have to open it up and lay it flat at airport security.The two software products I've installed are Office and Norton Internet Security. I'm not that much of a foolish Apple fanboy to ignore the probability of getting hit with malware or a virus from the Internet.I considered the 11" MBA, but as I'm older I felt the 13" would be better based on my eyesight. It's a very nice light, fast laptop.::Michael Drips "Book junkie"::5.0::July 3, 2012
R2MIBXQQ2GTYFN::What an Ultrabook::I reluctantly bought this because I was a Windows power user but after working with a network engineer he stated Apple is the future in private industry. I took the plunge since he stated Parallel 7 can allow you to run windows on mac. After 2 weeks of use this has to be one of the best ultra books  I ever used. Thin, light, and powerful with the option of windows. if you just want something simple Mac os is easy for average users simple clean and easy but if you want a power pc that is light this is a good purchase at max specs. I use my windows software with no issues and the mac side has better development software for pictures, movies, and office than windows. A great buy for it's size and features worth every penny. Just on thing expensive accessories but it is worth the investment.::Servo "Servo"::4.0::July 18, 2012
R3OMHQ3UE2Y3NH::Macbook Air 13"::This is without a doubt the best laptop I have ever purchased.Much faster than I initially thought it would be. Has taken everything I have thrown at it with relative ease. (I'm a software developer).Battery life is excellent. I routinely get 7+ hours a charge.Display is very bright and clear. I've abused my eyes for 25+ years behind computer displays so this is no small point.Light as a feather yet very sturdy.Almost zero noise from the fan under a normal load. Under a very heavy load it is still surprisingly quiet.Although I am not a fan of chicklet-style keyboards, this one has managed to not annoy me. Good size, layout, spacing and just enough travel. Ample palm rest for even large hands. The backlighting is a very nice touch.The multi-gesture trackpad is extraordinary. Hands down the best one I have ever used. This is the first time I have not reached for a mouse out of frustration. I don't even pack one in my laptop bag now.If this thing proves reliable and long-lived, I don't see myself ever going back to a PC-based laptop again.::G. T. Wilson::5.0::June 24, 2012
R22ZXIONY77BFH::Buggy product::I bought this Macbook Air because of recommendation from friends. However, first day the laptop could not connect to my home wireless network. I have tried at my work place, my friend home; but nothing seemed to work. I brought the laptop to apple store for service. After the service, I could connect to the wireless network after that service; but web page freeze all the time. My iPad which also used the same wireless network had no issue at all. I had also try again at work place, and friend home. The web page and app store  still freezing. I had to brought the laptop back to apple store for sevice again.::BAO MAI DUY::2.0::August 22, 2012

I purchased the 11" this past October, and I am already to go back to my macbook pro.  The first thing you notice when you get it, is the screen, it is definitely made of a different material, and it doesn't have nearly the same quality as the macbook pro does.  The memory that comes stock on these is also not the best.  I am not to worried about the disk drive, as it is almost 2013 and you really don't need anything to read a disk, cause you can get it mainly online now days.  It is definitely light, and very portable, but I would suggest for anyone to spend a couple hundred bucks more and purchase the macbook pro.  It comes with better processor, better built in memory, and a lot better looking of a screen, it is by far my favorite mac product ever made.::bmckinney::3.0::December 17, 2012

R4557D8WMDZY9::Love it!!::I was weary to get a mac because I haven't had much experience using one, but decided to take the plunge. I have had my macbook air for a few months now and I still love it. It is so light and easy to transport. It has pretty long battery life and so nice it never  overheats the way my HP did. You also easily adjust to the mac features and way of navigating.::Jennifer::5.0::December 2, 2012
R1MBNF54DLUH0I::Blazing fast and easy to use::The only downsides to this computer are 1) the 128 GB harddrive and 2) the lack of ability to user upgrade components such as RAM.  At first I thought the lack of optical drive would bother me but I realized almost every piece of software can be downloaded and if push comes to shove, you can buy and external optical drive for about $30.Also, the 128 GB harddrive can be expanded with an external hard drive.  The only one that really bothers me is the lack of ability to upgarde yourself.  The 4 GB of RAM is probably not enough but I didn't want to over pay from Apple to get the RAM and the price on Amazon was way cheaper than on the Apple website.Otherwise, this computer rocks and the amazing style, size and design are superb!  Worth the few extra hundred dollar premium to windows based ultra books or sleek books.::C. Kim::5.0::November 29, 2012
R2MH8FXX70EH3C::Rocks!!!::The Mabook Air just rocks.  I gave up a iPad 3 "New iPad" to buy this.  I the ipad works good for most stuff,  but when you need a real computing OS,  OSX beats IOS hands down.  The ability to download whatever you need is a plus in my book.  Speaking of books,  the macbook air is smaller, lighter than any book I have carried.  The weight is awesome. The size, the layout, just works great.  I recommend this laptop for anyone that is concerned about size and weight.  It is the perfect size.  Amazon always delivers.  I ordered this laptop and Fedex lost it right after they picked it up from Amazon.  When I didn't receive it the next day as scheduled,  I called fedex and they confirmed that it was lost.  I called Amazon,  and even though it took 3 calls to get them to understand the urgency of the issue, they handled it with flying colors.  Thanks Amazon for making it right!::T.

R1HZUWWUO9RMBF::Right Decision::I was looking for a second laptop and was considering getting another Macbook Pro, but after reading reviews it seemed that the Macbook Air might be the better option.

RDO84MHNNM4RC::First Mac in years, and completely satisfied::Using strictly company issued laptops for the past several years (in combination with a Samsung netbook for personal use) I haven't regularly used a Mac since around 2005. Now, after having used my Macbook Air for the past couple of months, I have to say that I'm completely pleased with the purchase. Very light and mobile (the battery lasts several hours), it's as convenient as a netbook, but with a much larger, stunning display (and it's certainly more powerful, too). I use it mostly for word processing and online research.For me the biggest plus is the gesture enabled trackpad (I honestly didn't think I'd like it at first, but I grew accustomed to it almost immediately) -- it's perfect for browsing the Internet. I'm so happy that I didn't opt for an inexpensive laptop.::Jennifer::5.0::September 18, 2012

R2KI4S42ORQF8D::One word: Sublime.::This is with out a doubt the best laptop that can be had at this price range. If not because it sports the latest Ivy-Bridge, amazing unibody design, USB 3.0, Thunderbolt, and many other cool features, then simply for the damn trackpad. I'm serious, go into an electronics store, and try out the trackpads on other ultrabooks and you will be immediately struck with the feeling of amazement on how such a simple part of a computer can make or break an immersive experience. And Mountain Lion takes full advantage of this wonderful trackpad. Sure, OSX does take a bit to learn when switching from a Windows OS, but in the end it honestly is more efficient at doing the things you love doing (surfing, writing e-mails, watching videos etc.)Overall this is a superb laptop. It may seem expensive at first, but Macs last so long, and they are built with such attention-to-detail that it makes the couple extra hundred bucks worth it. And yes, Macs used to be overpriced, but with this Macbook Air, that "Apple Tax" is dwindling ever more rapidly. You won't be disappointed!::Pat::5.0::August 21, 2012
R3IW03HJO50069::Macbook Air (2012)::Bought my air through a reseller on Amazon.  Great experience from DataVision.

R1Z75ZAQ4J1AVF::Still Prefer PC::I've always used PCs but I decided to try a MAC based the reviews and because they are known to be trouble free in terms of viruses.  But after buying it and trying it for about two weeks I decided to return it.Its a nice computer but everything is different.  For me to be able to use my computer "right out of the box" without any problems was the most important thing.  I had trouble with the "really annoying" voice help system.  I couldn't get it turned off for days.  And there were other small things that were just a little different.The final issue with me was compatibility with a writing program I hoped to use.  It required a lot of modification to the download to get it to work with a mac and I hate stuff like that.Anyway, so I started asking myself why I spent more on a computer I don't like?  So I got a PC.::Robert Carlton::2.0::December 9, 2012
R727QJM4MK3MZ::The multi-touch trackpad is the worst thing about this piece of crap::The multi-touch track pad has allot of functions which makes for a nice case of "bat s*** haywire" later on. PLEASE PURCHASE A WARRANTY ON THIS!!!!! I have read MANY different people's posts on forums that experience the same problem. One minute you will type something and if you click send it will erase the text, it highlights things I have no intention of highlighting, opens programs when moving your cursor past a program icon, has ended up sending emails when all I do is click to read them.

RR0ED5YQVU3SC::Amazing Mac!::I've had many Macs over the years but this is Air is amazing.  Upgraded from a MacBook Pro (mid 2010) and its way faster in every way.  It actually has me using my iPad (3rd gen) less which is surprising.  It's just so light and the screen and battery life are great.  Retina screen would be the only improvement but I still think thats 1 1/2 - 2 years away.  I purchased a 13" i5 / 4GB / 256GB,  its plenty fast but I decided to return it and future proof a little with a custom build 8GB RAM and 2.0 GHZ i7 processor direct from Apple.  Cost a little more but I think it will also help with resell value.  I usually only keep my Macs for a little over 2 years before I sell.What ever model Air you get, there is a very high chance you will love it.::DribbleCastle::5.0::July 3, 2012
R3VZHVE3M6JU2Z::Most Amazing one ... Yet::I have been with Apple for long time, and by far this is the most amazing Mac i own yet.  Battery life is way better and charge faster.

R2F420XYORK1RQ::Macbook Air::I have recently bought this computer because I needed something that I could carry around and do my homework on. I love that this computer is very light and small, but is also very durable. When I bought it, I was a little nervous that it would break easily, but that is not the case. The computer starts up and shuts down very fast. This is nice because I am an inpatient person. The last computer I had did not have a built-in microphone and camera. I like this feature very much because I use Skype a lot to meet with groups for my classes. The one thing that I don't like is that it doesn't have a cd drive on the side. Overall this is a great computer and has done everything that I expected it too.::Abby::5.0::June 21, 2012
R2IOTNWZZ9JLNY::Battery Life issue::Such a disappointment. The laptop is great and agree with the other reviews. We already had one (version 2010) and it works like a charm. Unfortunately, I bought the 2012 version where the battery last 2 to 3 hours if you are lucky. For me, the battery life and weight are the most important for a laptop. I read a lot of things, contacted apple, went to apple but I am still with a great piece of hardware that I need to plug every 2 hours. Apple lost it and they are now too big to be customer focus like in the earlier days. This is my last Apple purchase. Sorry Steve but your legacy has lasted less than a year.::Chris::2.0::November 4, 2012
RLR3K7BY0Z2JU::excellent but expensive::If there was a similar product i would have bought it. However, after reading all the reviews of various laptops, macbook seems to match what i needed. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't too expensive.::kate::4.0::November 4, 2012

R14JROU6NQS0S0::Look Somewhere Else::My family owns a lot of Apple products, and this by far is the worst. This was my first Apple computer, and probably my last. I didn't expect there to be so many issues encountered, as I was unfamiliar with the differences when I first bought it. A few are that there is little to no storage (I'm constantly being reminded that I have less than 1 GB left of 60), barely any riveting games available to Apple (Except The Sims--But be careful, because you have absolutely NO storage to support it), and the act of carrying around a separate CD drive can be obnoxious.I must admit, the Movies feature is impressive and useful for school projects, but that's about it.Congratulations Apple, I've officially been converted.::Tuffle::1.0::June 24, 2013
R2HKDWN9TUM3C8::$700 repair even with warranty::I just spent $700 for a repair on my Macbook Air that has a warranty.  It was only the track pad that wasn't working.  First story was that the repair was covered under my warranty.  Three days later the story was that  there was water damage and I would have to pay.Given the issues with compatibility, the premium price, and the issues with the warranty, I have to consider something else for my next computer.  Apple is good for user ease, synchronizing with other Apple devices, but it is behind the curve in technology and features and overpriced.iWorks is not as good as Word/Excel.  I have to duplicate everything that I share so that my documents and spreadsheets can be opened by my friends and colleagues.My next computer will likely not be an Apple.::Jim::1.0::October 21, 2012
R2TE2CJNFZWWN3::Buy a Netbook for $249 if you are not sold on the name "Apple"::I bought this thinking it is a good machine with good features.To start being an Apple or Mac fan can be really expensive or I should say a rip off. The productivity software, the anti-virus, the accounting software, the HDMI ports, you are looking to replace everything with this purchase as nothing that you owned before works.I agree with the graphics and some hardware superiority this machine might have over others, but I am not a gamer, and I do not focus on pictures and music a lot, so this MacBook Air goes back to Apple store after 24 hours of me having it.::A. Gupta "Andy G"::1.0::March 7, 2013
R3I9WW2M01L6QJ::Delicate, Easy to Break Screen::I purchased this "new version" of the Macbook Air as a birthday present for my wife when it was first released.  First off let me say that she absolutely loves the thing, but that being said I HATE it.  About 3 months after I purchased it she broke the screen. It is the only thing not covered in the warranty. I replaced the screen at a cost of $750. It broke again, and I replaced it for $750. Now, once more, it has a broken screen. I will obviously not be replacing it(this makes my wife cry). I gave this product the lowest rating possible because I feel like it breaks by design(She never broke any screens util she got this laptop). The screens on the older version of Macbook Airs can be fixed for around $250(perhaps Apple was not satisfied with this reasonable repair cost). I am so irritated that Apple would make something so breakable, so expensive, that I will not ever be purchasing an Apple product again. I am left feeling like Apple makes real cool products that are designed to break real good, and it is working out real well for them.::Chris&Karma::1.0::August 13, 2012
RGAHW0PFWS628::Sad but Apple not honouring commitment to free Upgrade to Mountain Lion::I received my Macbook Air yesterday. The first thing that I tried to do was to upgrade the OS to mountain lion as this laptop came with a free upgrade. But to my surprise/Shock , even after repeatedly going through a tedious process of submitting the proof of purchase and delivery for the Macbook air that I have purchased through Amazon.com, I still kept receiving the same one line response from Apple saying "Receipt does not indicate product was paid for and received". What do they mean by product was paid for and received , when I have already given them a photo of my mac with  serial no.  and a Amazon Invoice and package tracking with status delivered.It's difficult to understand how else a customer can prove the same.It is very sad to see customers to be given a run around when they have been committed something by the Apple, that too for a $ 20 item. One of the reasons that for then not honouring their commitment is that Amazon is not one of their Authorized reseller. This clearly means that Apple would like to force their customers to purchase only from their own website or stores , which is highly anti- competitive and illegal in my opinion.  Overall ,It has been a very bad experience for me buying the Macbook on Amazon , coming from a long time loyal Amazon customer.::Rohan::1.0::July 31, 2012
RB06RL87V6Z7N::BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!::DONT LISTEN TO ANY BAD REVIEWS ON THIS COMPUTER! Apple is a great company and will help you with anything you need.

R1S3F6TMCPR4NG::Screen resolution not great and no HDMI::I really like the style and build of this laptop but I cannot get over the screen resolution. For me, fonts not being sharp and crisp is a deal breaker. I googled the issue to find that many are experiencing the same complaint. If you read a lot and look at small text, the fonts are automatically smoothed (anti-aliasing) which is a default by Apple. I have found a few tweaks to adjust this but it is still does not solve the resolution issue. Also, for the price, it would have been nice to get an HDMI port. I don't think its pratical that I now have to go and but another cable in order to use HDMI.::surfca::1.0::July 22, 2012
R1TMNSF6XH1VL9::Macbook Air Sucks::Really not happy with Macbook Air.  Without Adobe Flash Player, the computer is very limited.  I am afraid to download it onto it because of the problems others have had with crashes.  Whatever conflicts Apple has with Google, Adobe, and others is not good for Apple's customers.  Would not recommend this item to anyone.  I have to use my old Dell Laptop for Facebook and Youtube Videos.  Anyone looking to buy this product should first check out it's limitations.::Lee::2.0::January 15, 2013

It not even close to 7 hrs as in advertisement.8) Its not even quieter when I watch movies or any other applications as told in advertisement.9) I did not have credit card so I did not make apple account so when I formated my computer as directed by the apple customer care I had to buy OS X mountain lion againg.And I spend 3000 bucks for this laptop and when I go to genius bar they expect me to just listen they can't help anymore. Why did I even buy this thing?::baba2kul::1.0::March 12, 2013
R5Z6OV3P49TTZ::Does not ship with latest OS::This is not a complaint about the machine but about Amazon. We purchased this computer on Sept. 20, 2012, and it shipped with OS 10.7.4 -- well over a month after 10.5 was released. Amazon customer service was unable to help. It is annoying that we have to pay for the OS upgrade after buying a new machine. We will probably have to return it and order another one. Of course I guess there's no guaranty Amazon will ship that one with the newest OS.::Norman::1.0::September 22, 2012

Apple has never given equal hardware for equal prices. Your paying four or more times the cost of the technology. In this case out-dated hardware. Sure their are thousands of idiot minded diehard Apple Users; you can see them standing in lines; who are most likely also Obama supporters. The game here is to train the technology sheep; and then feed them hardware fodder; and once they get their fill; they will follow wherever you take them.

I called the company to order a repair under their warranty. They said that I have to send it in and they will take care of it. They emailed me instructions that explained how it's done and I had to fill an form with information. So far so good, but as I finished to fill up the form they wanted me to pay for the shipping or to pay for a special box for shipping in the amount of $25.00. I would have given them five stars but since it was not my fault that I have purchased defective computer, they should have taken responsibility and paid for the shipping.::Amir Gal "Neil G."::2.0::December 18, 2011
R2IBS0NM4ANQXK::Awesome Little Computer::This is an awesome little computer! It is the perfect size for carrying back and forth from work and home. It has plenty of memory, and it is so much faster than my previous computer. I'm not a computer whiz, but I know my way around a keyboard, and this laptop fit the bill for me.Pros: Fast, portable, good battery life, plenty of memory, no problems, sturdyCons: The only thing I can think of is that it doesn't have a number pad. But if it did, then the computer itself would have to be bigger, and the size is a huge plus for me--so I'm not complaining!::Eve Ferris::5.0::November 15, 2011
R3JTMRFHUXJVJ4::Good for multipurpose use including gaming::I have had this laptop for almost a year and it is awesome. It can handle the Sims 3 on all high graphics, and it plays League of Legends just fine, I never have any problems with it. And it can run Diablo 3 but it can get really glitchy. It evens runs faster than my friends $1,200 Asus. The size isn't too small, and it isn't too big either, it can rest on my lap just fine, and I can throw it in my backpack or a larger handbag and be off. For battery life it is pretty good, I have no complaints.The only considerable draw back on this laptop are the speakers; they just aren't loud enough sometimes, but since I use this laptop primarily for school work, Facebook, and online games, the audio isn't a huge must for me. The only thing that has worn out since I got it was the left mouse key; it has trouble clicking sometimes, but I think it's just because I only ever used that button, I never used the mouse pad. But even then it still works,lol. So yes I would recommend this laptop for someone who does light gaming, school work, surfing the web, and who wants great portability.::Janelle::4.0::October 24, 2012
R3SVX6BEB6S3NG::So far, So Great::I bought this computer a few months ago, so I can't comment on how it holds up over time. But so far it has been excellent. Its size makes it easy to carry around and the keyboard is one of the few that I can work with (the new computers all push the letters slightly to the left, which is difficult for me). It's fast and durable and the battery lasts forever. Before this computer I had a Dell, which was not bad until it crashed after 3 years. After that I bought an HP that sounded as if it might explode so I ended up exchanging it for this model. After a week or so I tripped over the power cord and the laptop landed HARD upside down on the floor. Still works like a charm. :)::Gwen::5.0::December 4, 2011
R3UIJHAFDFFMFV::Can't find the good::Not only am I very dissatisfied with this laptop, but the Toshiba company is terrible too. The buttons on the key board stick. The left mouse button basically "collapsed" in and now I have to position it perfectly every time I want to click or just use the touch pad. The USB drive is not compatible with certain USB cords. I wasn't as pissed until I found out a lot of other people have the exact same problems. The computer has not had any problems in terms of memory, battery, speed or anything like that but these key things make it so frustrating to use. The toshiba company is the WORST company I have every tried to get support from. I have called to fix issues with my computer. I am an IT coordinator at my office, I am nothing special but I know basic trouble shooting like any normal person. The people I spoke with on the phone were all completely incompetent and unhelpful. Eventually when I started to move in the right direction of getting a worth answer, they told me my warranty was up and to even talk to a customer service rep further I would have a ridiculous fee! The costumer service people talked to me like I was a child, how many times do I need to explain the troubleshooting I have done myself and has failed before you believe that I actually did it! NEVER EVER again will a get anything from this company.::Martha::1.0::November 5, 2013
RJ2RMC82TXN51::Sturdy and powerful::I've got a 4 year old One of these in silver. over time the only things that have stopped working are the things that have been accidentally damaged. it's still cruising right on along and while i have not bought one from this seller or any of them here... i recommend this computer to anyone who needs something reliable. the only downside i can think of is that the power chords WILL break due to the design flaw where it connects to the computer, the replacements from toshiba are like 80$ but you can find a much cheaper one online or at some place like walmart or target.::john shelton::5.0::April 30, 2014

R10KGOLBG7J630::Dell Inspiron 17R - good machine for the $$; not great.::I've had the Dell Inspiron 17R (500 gig hard drive; 4 gigs RAM; i5-2410m processor) for about a month. I upgraded it to 6 gigs of RAM.The Inspiron is a pretty good value.  You get a lot of machine for the money.  The i5-2410m processor is fast.  Combined with the large amount of RAM, it'll handle with ease any normal, everyday task, such as watching movies, browsing, word processing, home video editing, and so on.  I can't speak to whether it'd be suitable for gaming, because I don't use it for that. However, it is quite a powerful laptop for routine computer stuff.I have seen the screen criticized elsewhere, for not being super-high resolution, but I disagree.  The 17.3" screen is one of the high points of this laptop.  It is bright, sharp, and easy to read.  I've always been a fan of "desktop replacement" laptops, and have several over the years, always with a 17" screen. I think this is one of the better screens out there.  It's 1600x900, which is not 1920x1080, but it's still very sharp, and the Inspiron 17R is half the price of a 1920x1080 laptop.It comes with a nice mix of ports. Two USB 3.0, a USB 2.0, and an extremely useful eSATAe.  The USB3.0 ports are not providing the kind of performance I was hoping for.  I think that either the laptop or my external drives are not configured properly to take advantage of USB3.0.  I'm getting USB3.0 speeds that are little better than USB2.0.  On the other hand, the eSATAe port is blazin' fast.  I plan just to use the eSATAe port and not bother with the 3.0 ports.My main complaint with this laptop is the mouse pad.  There are some laptops out there that have a mouse which jumps around too much.  This is one of them. Many other laptops do not have this problem anymore; it was a design problem that was fixed over the years.  So, what does this problem entail?  When you're typing, the cursor will occasionally jump elsewhere on the screen, and if you're not careful, you can end up deleting important text.  And, as another reviewer noted, there's the occasional related problem of the mouse-pointer sort of pinning itself to the right side of the screen; when this happens, nothing you do on the mousepad will unstick it, and you just have to fuss with it and, ultimately, wait for it to decide to start working again.  Experimenting with the mouse pad controls (sensitivity and speed, in Control Panel) helps a little, but not a lot. Fundamentally, it is just a bad mouse pad, something that should have been addressed by Dell and put to rest a long, long time ago.  The cursor-jumpiness around the screen is just unacceptable on a modern laptop.  The keyboard itself is mediocre; it has nice chicklet-style keys that are easy to type on, but they occasionally miss a letter when they shouldn't.  I spilled just a couple of drops of Diet Coke on one key, and now that key and six surrounding keys have permanent pop-and-crackle noises when I touch them.  Many (in fact, "most" or "all") other laptop keyboards are more mishap-tolerant than the one in the 17R. I want to love this laptop, but I have to say that laptops from other brands such as Toshiba have much better keyboards and mouse pads.The battery life is poor.  It is the shortest battery life I have ever experienced on a laptop.  You can get about 90 minutes if you are doing light browsing.  Any sort of heavy usage, like movie-watching, will put you down in the 60 to 75 minute range.  I really don't get that.  I've had other 17" monitor laptops that ran for 2.5 to 3.5 hours between charges.  It doesn't bother me much, because I use it at home, where it's plugged in.  If I was in more of a road-warrior mode, I would've already returned it.  This laptop basically needs to be plugged in when you're using it.  It is also very heavy - substantially heavier than my last couple of 17" laptops.  It really is not designed for road use, either in battery usage or weight; it's truly an old-school desktop replacement laptop.In summary: for the price, you get a lot of laptop with Dell.  The Inspiron 17R has a beautiful screen, a very fast processor, and ample storage and RAM for normal business or personal use.  I don't think for the $600 to $700 (depending on configuration) you can get much more laptop elsewhere.  However, the mouse, and specifically the jumpiness of the mouse, truly sucks.  The keyboard is very low-end -- so low-end it's hard to believe Dell thought this was an acceptable component to put on a modern, $600 machine.  All in all, I give this laptop 3 stars.  I would like to see Dell really drill down on why their mousepads and keyboards are not up to the competition, and replace them with better parts.  I have a feeling this one will last about a year or two, and then I will probably replace it with a different brand.::Cynesige::3.0::September 19, 2011
R2D0OVKMDTXDT4::A Beautiful Monster::Overall, I love this product, though considering the last computer I had was a 12.5" <1GHz joke my expectations were easy to surpass.Processing speed is excellent. It has no problems with multiple intensive programs like Illustrator, Photoshop etc. running at the same time, and I assume it would work as well with games. Surprisingly little bloatware.The camera is nice for basic skyping; I have my own, so I don't use it enough to have much of an opinion other than that it's about the same quality as a lower-mid range one at Best Buy. Software for the camera has some fun stuff like frames/avatars that integrate with a plugged-in camera as well.Size is GLORIOUS. Dwarfs any other laptop in the room. Makes Macbooks look like toys. Awesome for multitasking.Shipped on time, box was huge with the normal Dell box inside, I assume for protection, which clearly worked.She's pretty too; I guess I didn't look hard enough at the pictures to see it before I ordered, but rather than a solid black the whole deck and backing is a  varied-size stripe pattern with a few shades of black/grey, maybe the tiniest bit of brown-black/blue-black. It's sort of like woodgrain without knots, more attractive that I'm probably describing it.Sound quality is, well, quality. Noticeable difference between it and my last laptop, though again, the bar was not set too high.Of course, there is a catch. Within a few hours of starting it up the mouse started to stick, jerking back to the right edge of the screen every time I panned left. It goes away within a minute, but comes back every few hours and is EXTREMELY ANNOYING. I don't know if this is a hardware or software problem, or if there is a way to fix it. If someone has any idea it would be very helpful. I doubt this is a problem with this entire model; more likely a flaw specific to this computer or some percentage of the models. It's probably just my punishment for the thousands of helpless orphans I torture and kill each week.::ml::4.0::September 16, 2011
R2RP84ODK0ZXC2::Dell Laptop::Works great had it for 3 weeks and no problems. Good speed and the screen is great! Placed it on a 3M stand and it is better than previous desktop. Also used a remote keyboard and mouse and only has 2 connection wires.::Kevin Culver "Racinmoose"::4.0::November 5, 2011
R1X9IOFR27BDE5::Better than I expected but still a Dell.::Bought this laptop to use in college until I could afford something better. Personally I'm fairly biased against Dell laptops mainly since of the 3 I've had all of their power supplies (battery, cable and/or plug-ins on mother board) never lasted more than a year, and they are proprietary to their own products or services (meaning usually they want you to pay them to do anything including swapping a HDD, and many universal chargers won't actually charge the battery and only power the machine). So far for having this machine for a month it's been fairly decent as for speed wise.Pro's: Speedy, battery last longer than expected for a 17" expandable memory up to 8GB of DDR3, and good price for what you recieve.Con's: It's a Dell (personal), already has shut down on me twice while typing a paper and wouldn't boot for more than 5 minutes on any power combination (and no it wasn't overheated it was cool to the touch), don't expect to be able to change or swap out the hard drive as there is no accessible bay unless you completely disassemble the bottom half of the machine.::Failcat "Failing Fail Mayor of Failtown"::4.0::October 8, 2011

R2RVM7FM4Y9UNX::Generally pleased with the inspiron::I was annoyed at the tedious work necessary for the initial startup. It required a lot of reviewing, clicking, and information requests. After all that, I needed to save the startup information on a DVD-R disk, which I didn't have. A CD-R nor a DVD-RW were acceptable. Dell should have just included a blank DVD-R instead of requesting a $40 charge to save it online.That being said, I must say I am pretty impressed with the laptop. It boots up rapidly, and it works very well with my Fios wireless internet. The internet speed is good, and I don't have any problems with the connection dropping off. Playing music from Youtube is a breeze. The speakers are adequate, but my plug-in headphones are better. Controlling the volume by pressing the FN and F11/F12 works well enough.The picture quality is good. I had no problem downloading photographs from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day site and making them my desktop background. When I blow the pictures up, however, I notice the pixels are not real sharp. This may be a problem with the photos and not the laptop.Wordpro seems to work well. I was able to add photos and my own drawings to the text.The keyboard is still a little problematic for me. I have a hard time getting my fingers on the correct keys. If the "F" and "J" keys had a small bump on them I could place my hands correctly on the keyboard without looking. The ten key needs a light to indicate that number lock is activated.Overall I must say that I am pleased with this laptop.  I have had it for only three days so I need more time to explore its strengths and weaknesses; however I can heartily recommend this laptop.::Cathy Cowart::4.0::December 5, 2012
R1Q03ST3XHYYLS::Dell Inspiron user::Laptop looks great and runs well! Start up and shut down is fast, no "blue" screens encountered (yet--but don't expect any). Set up easy, simple and fast. I don't run any computer games on this machine, so I casnnot, at this time, say if it's a good gaming machine or not. May run some games on it in the future. Works great with all the apps that I have on it. Would recommend it to anuone looking for a solid, reliable and dependable machine.

R1H5TR2NLB65CJ::NEVER buy a HP, it's a dishonest trap::I got my new HP laptop for day one (it is not from Amazon) and HP tricked me to have a antivirus software installed during initial software installation.What really dirty here is they also ship a bunch of software fully of trojan horse and virus in the default software package. So when I try to use the internet browser for the first surf, the antivirus software jumps out like a gang and blocks me from doing anything, including uninstall itself!  Every time, I am forced to enter a page asking to pay $69.99 for their stupid and buggy software. Am I going to pay you the $69.99 stupid money that you are begging for?  NO!  I return this crap back to where it is from.It also reminds me another HP printer I had that it expires its ink box after a few months and I cannot print if I don't buy a new costy HP ink. The reason is to "Guarantee print quality". Come on, it's back ink!HP is running DIRTY business. It cheats, it begs. it sucks. It ties to dishonestly play dirty games with customers. Simply stay away from it!  It should go to the hell.::Clifford Cheney::1.0::December 1, 2011
RUP31F0ZRWCXM::Faulty battery...::Probably just bad luck, but this computer came with a battery that wouldn't charge. The battery indicator said it was experiencing "temporary battery failure" which after some google searching I found out basically meant the battery was done for good. The Dell support was BRUTAL. Got the run around, everyone tried to sell me an additional service plan when all I wanted was to get a new battery under the original warranty.However, I will say Amazon was AMAZING about the return. I printed off a label, threw it back in the box, and sent it back no charge. They refunded me the full amount with no questions!::JDGravina::1.0::October 18, 2011
R1SW08AYOSPX69::Great laptop for the price!::I picked up this laptop at my local Best Buy for $299.  I read the reviews on the Best Buy site before purchasing this laptop, and the majority of them that had complaints had complaints of encountering blue screens of death within a short amount of time of purchasing the laptop.  Others had issues with the sensitivity of the touch pad, but overall there were positive reviews.While I was removing some of the unwanted software like the Best Buy app, I encountered a blue screen of death.  This was because when I restarted to complete the uninstall of some of the programs, it did NOT install the windows updates.  Once these were installed, I haven't had a problem since.  So once you get your computer, make sure you shut down to install updates, and then commence removing the bloatware.Pros: Nice screen size, has good enough specs to run several mildly heavy programs at the same time, HDMI port, excellent keyboard (it doesn't have the traditional bracketed keys, but the more embedded buttons like the Mac Books, plus a num pad), solid design, runs very quiet and cool (extremely cool. With it sitting on my lap it does not even get warm.), good battery life if you use the energy management for it, fingerprint reader, facial recognition, and built in webcam.Cons: Touch pad is a little sensitive, but I came from using a Thinkpad where I used the touch point mouse. It may just be because I need to get used to it.  External mouses are always a compromise.Overall a very good computer for the price.::BettaFreak::5.0::August 29, 2011
R3H4ROVDEQC85B::Great Value Priced Laptop::I bought this because my wife and I are both in school, and one laptop is not enough. I was looking for something to run MS Office and a web browser. This was by far the most feature laden machine in its price range. It has fingerprint lock, webcam, 4GB RAM, and a dual-core processor. Once I got it home, I was pleasantly surprised to see there was no bloatware other than the BestBuy app, so I did not have near as many programs to uninstall as usual. They advertise fast boot ups, and mine boots in about 45 seconds, much faster than my Toshiba. I picked this up from BestBuy for $299 and would gladly make the purchase again.::Derek Shockley::5.0::August 27, 2011
RDVGE0PN9GU8N::cool finger recognition but horrible touchpad::this is the first time I've used finger recognition for security and the idea is great and easy to implement but when you come to use it it takes a lot of time to process your swipe.  It is much faster to just type in your password.  I loved that you could project your screen to your HDTV through HDMI for such a low price.  The touch pad was awful and responded differently almost every time.  This touchpad was the most frustrating touchpad I've see tried.

R8H4JRPIIQX0F::For the price you are paying it takes best in Price class::[...][...][...][...]My Review of the Lenovo Essentials series B575My Mission upon searching for a new laptop this time around was the following...1.

I needed it to do basic tasks while being able to handle Light gaming (World of warcraft,Diablo 3,SC2,Steam games) and still have a respectable battery life3. I wanted the build quality to also not TOTALLY suck even though it is an extreme budget class.Tall order for a 350$ budget right?  This laptop accomplished that on 299$  Purchased from bestbuyLet me start by saying this will be a fairly short review (Though i will add additional information upon request if someone wants to know something specific)Full Specifications:CPU: AMD E 450 APU 1.65 Ghz Dual coreGPU: ATI 6320 Intergrated into the APUHD: 5400 RPM HD 320GBRam: 4 GB DDR3Display: widescreen LED (1366 x 768) 15.6OS: Windows 7 64 bit PremiumWireless B+G+NFingerprint ReaderPort Locker4 USB slotsHDMI OUTWebcamera 0.3 MPProduct Height 1.3"Product Width 14.9"Product Weight 5.2 lbs.Product Depth 9.9"Keyboard Full size Chiclet with Number pad6 in1 media reader slotPerformance: Thus far i have play tested Diablo 3 And world of warcraft with the following resultsWorld of Warcraft using Lowest settings and the default Resolution Provides a consistent 30-45 FPS in a large scale Battleground enviorment (Settings can be turned slightly higher in 5 mans or questing solo)Diablo 3 Is quite playable at 20-30 FPS on lowest settings i was very surprised this game was playable at ALL on this machine let alone respectably playable at thatHD movie playback 720P is without issues on NetflixMultitasking is ok as long as you don't get TOO unreal once i had Pandora WoW Chrome with 4 tabs open you could notice slowdown not apparent in better CPU's.The machine sadly however comes with TONS of bloatware you either need to uninstall or do a fresh reformat to get the max performance out of this machineBuild QualityThe keyboard is great with almost zero flex unless pushed very hard, palm rest area is equally strong..My biggest concern is the plastic behind the LCD is VERY weak and can be flexed VERY easily...I can produce no screen ripple pushing upon it..however it is a worry if the laptop sits inside a bag for long periods traveling and gets bumped around a ton.  Also the DVD drive is a bit worrysome as it shoots out much like a bullet and the tray is very stiff..not smooth at all.  The biggest annoyance is the USB/Power cord slot...they are the stiffest i have EVER encountered...i thought i was going to have to buy a mallet to work a USB mouse into any of the ports...it's insane you REALLY need to push to get anything in them..The power cord is also slightly stiff but not as bad.  The Screen is what it is..it has apparent light leakage to be expected for a budget machine but is largely not noticable when gaming or video watching..it's Plenty bright even on LOW which is fantastic for battery savings.BatteryThus far the only test i have run was playing World of Warcraft on LOW brightness but HIgh performance the laptop lasted 3 Hours 22 Minutes before shutting down.  I will add further Battery tests as i go through them myself with time.HeatHeat on this machine is fairly non existant even when gaming under load their is a tiny bit of warmth on the left Palm rest side when under heavy load but nothing of major concern.Ultimately i went with lenovo as when you are dealing with this price range you are dealing with cheap build quality across the board and compared to similar brands/specs this was the best built of the bargains and Lenovo has a great reputation::Derek A.

R2KYX63X55MH2Y::(Edited) Now a "possible" buy!::Below is the original review of this product.  Here is my revision.Turns out that the laptop itself is fine.  The hard drive was erased due to a virus.  Not sure where it came from as it supposedly had 30 days of free protection.  Guess it's intended user didn't update regularly.  Will provide a later update on this product once the 'damages' have been taken care of.  Apologies to Lenovo and it's manufacturers.(I bought this laptop after reading some of the reviews on other laptops that suggested buying this one instead.  It was suppose to be more for the money.  It is... if it worked.  The third time it was started, I got a message 'BOOTMGR is missing. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart.... which just takes me to the same darn screen.  CAN NOT START THE COMPUTER!!!  Wish I had known it was Made in China, I'd have never bought it - nothing I ever buy from that dang country works longer than it takes to grow a 5 o'clock shadow.  Pathetic piece of equipment.)::D. Root::3.0::August 30, 2012
R3TXFIAUXQEGAY::My First Lenovo::I bought the Lenovo because of the newer AMD processor and 4GB RAM.  I have owned Gateway, Acer, Dell, and Toshiba laptops over the last 10 years.  I hate this Lenovo and will be looking for a new laptop in next few weeks.  Will give this one to my grand kids to play games on.First, the touchpad is so sensitive that even as I was writing this review, I touched somewhere and the entire page jumped so low I had to recover with the mouse back to the text area.  I truly hate it.  Additionally, the touchpad is positioned so far to the left, you almost always have your hand on the right side of touchpad and it will go wild when touched on the right side.Second, Lenovo suggests they have a fast boot optimizer.  Oh well, some mornings it takes it about 4 minutes to actually show anything on the screen.  Worst boot time I have ever experienced.  And yes, I have run their optimizer many times.Third, when I use a browser, even with all the RAM, the hard drive spins like crazy and you can not move up or down the page until all 'ads' are fully loaded.  The mouse just stays in a spin status until the ads fully load up.  I have tried it with Explore, Chrome, and Foxfire.  All do the same.  Very disgusting!  Never experienced this before on any laptop, netbook, or tablet that I have owned.That's enough!  If you love the machine and want to buy it cheap, let me know.  I am not a novice at this as I have an Acer and Gateway laptop now along with an IPad and HP Touchpad.  Nothing performs as poor as this machine.Hope you do better if you get one!::Charles Browning::2.0::December 9, 2011
RCKM98G81DVY2::For my use, a work horse indeed::I lost my job of 16 years and needed to learn and become current with the latest versions of Windows and Microsoft Office.  My LAN line still has Windows 98 and still works great so instead of doing an upgrade decided to try a laptop enabling me to get out of the house; going to local "hot spots" to study. I chose this laptop from Best Buys for the price, rating, and easy access to support (Geek Squad). I've had my laptop for just over 3 years and after an initial issue, which was resolved quickly through the Geek Squad, it has been a great tool and true work horse. I use it for everything now; thinking of retiring my desktopI just recently learned that I should not be leaving the battery in when I using it mostly with the AC adapter. I very rarely use it off the adapter. After three years none of the issues I've been told about are happening. I still have the same battery and get about 3 hours of battery usage, which is all I've ever gotten, I think. If I should be getting more, I'm still not at all disappointed. It appears the replacement batteries are not expensive and I am still very happy with the performance.::Marta Betts "Marta Betts"::5.0::January 4, 2014
R129UMAQ8XGXH1::It functions, but not well::I bought this laptop refurbished for a little less than $300, and I love it. Most of the time, it takes less than a minute to boot up, the screen is clear, and it's a large enough screen for me. I love how easy it is to type on the keyboard. The touchpad is a little off center to the left, but that doesn't bother me the way it could annoy some people. The only thing that I don't really like about this laptop is that it feels a bit cheap. When there's a DVD in it, it'll start spinning really fast, and it'll start making a loud rattling noise. The front cover of the laptop feels a little flimsy and the plastic frame around the screen is plastic-y and loose. Other than the rattling though, this laptop works pretty much perfectly.Edit: Now that I've had this laptop for almost a few months, I figured this review needed an update.I had originally given it four stars, but I dropped it down to three. My DVD drive randomly stopped working for two months, and I almost bought a new external drive. I decided to check it one last time before I bought a new one, and it started working. I've still been a little nervous that it'll randomly stop working again. It also goes so much slower now that it's not brand new. On average, it takes 3 minutes to start up and log me on, and every time I try to open a program, it takes at least 20 seconds for it to open.On top of that, the screen isn't very good. I like to edit photos on my computer, but it's really hard to tell whether or not the color looks good because it's hard to tell what the actual picture looks like because the colors are pretty dull on this screen compared to other screens. The screen resolution is also not that great, either. I've ordered photos online from multiple places, and a lot of my pictures are blurry, but I could't tell on my computer. I've also looked at my pictures on some school computers that have better resolution, and it's much easier to edit the pictures on the school computers rather than my laptop.This laptop does function well enough, but I'll be upgrading to a Macbook Air this fall when I leave for college. It'll be lighter, sturdier, and faster than this one. My younger brother doesn't have a laptop and never has, so I'll be giving this one to him. He's very excited to have his own computer, and this laptop is definitely better than the ancient laptops that need to be plugged into an Ethernet cord in order to have internet connection.If you have any questions, feel free to ask!::Mashley21::3.0::October 13, 2012
R3L9EFMJCBQVG9::For the price, it really is an amazing computer.::I was on the hunt for a low cost, high quality laptop.The things that I was looking for in a laptop were:-A clear, bright screen-At least 14 inch screen-Fast!-An island keyboard-A number pad-Under $350 total-Windows 7-webcam and mic-clear sound-disk input-memory card inputI bought this laptop at best buy. I hunted around at other stores such as walmart, office depot and even here on amazon but in the end found it at best buy and bought it a day later. It fit literally EVERYTHING on my list and I couldn't be  more thrilled. It's so fast and bright I have no complaints.I use it mostly for online things. Youtube is so fast! It's faster than my desktop that cost me over $1000 two years ago. There is no lagging. I play games that are slow on all of my other friends laptops such as OMGPOP and Pottermore and have no issues with lagging. I don't download much, just a few things like GIMP, Skype and MS Word.The pros are all of the things I listed that I wanted. It really does include all those things and it does them well. The color is beautiful and the keyboard is perfect for what I wanted.Some cons would be the battery life. It's short. As in, really short. You can expect probably 3 and a half hours max out of it. For me that doesn't really matter since I always have it plugged in when I'm using it, or I only use it for a little while unplugged. Another con would be the body shape. It's very square and the edges are really "sharp". Not really sharp but pointy? It can start to hurt your arm depending upon how you rest it. One more thing that I feel the need to mention, but you can easily fix when you set it up is the pinch zoom. Anytime you have anything other than your one finger resting on the key pad (even by accident) and are viewing a webpage it will start scrolling in and out spasticly. You can change that in the control panel though, so it was an easy fix.One thing that really has helped me improve the speed and quality of my experience is uninstalling and removing all of the "garbage" software. I got rid of Norton and got AVG since it's smaller. I also I got rid of countless other softwares and I have noticed how much FASTER my computer goes. It's really crazy how much little things like that can make a difference. Not that it was slow before but now it's just crazy fast.I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because while I LOVE it, bad battery life can be seen as a horrible problem to some.For this price though, you really can't get any better. It's a very nice laptop that  would be a perfect match for anyone who isn't looking for a Macbook quality.Despite the fact that lenovo is a less known brand, I recommend you take a leap of faith. My laptop has turned out to be nicer than my friend's brand new HP that she paid $100 MORE for.::birdsofafeather220::4.0::August 9, 2012
R37CSB48R0T5WH::Wonderful computer for any price::I purchased this laptop from Best Buy in early February for a great price and have not had a single problem with the computer at all. I mostly use this for schoolwork, which means PowerPoint, Word, Internet research and the occasional internet surfing here and there, so I may not be the ideal reviewer for this product under those looking for a gaming computer or something that needs to be blisteringly fast. But given the simple tasks I ask of it, it has performed much better than I could have anticipated.Pros:- Runs very cool and quiet (not even warm on my lap)- Power management settings, when tuned properly, have allowed me to work 5.5 hours continuous on a full charge- Smooth keyboard - I love to type on this computer. Its quiet and it glides as I type.- Nice widescreen- Fingerprint security is neat, and there is a security program to password protect the computer from any USB device plugged in. There is also a face recognition security program (have not used). All of these make this machine ideal for those concerned over privacy or those who live with immature imbeciles that think its funny to mess with someones computer :)- Charger folds up nice and tight for easy transport (compared to computers of similar size)- 4 USB ports, HDMI and eSATA ports- Full 10 digit numerical keypad on keyboard for faster number inputCons:- Edge on front of computer is not smooth and digs into my palms when surfing the internet, but not an issue when typing or the computer is on my lap (only happens when it is on my desk)- The full 10 digit numerical keyboard cramps the keyboard just a bit. This also pushed the touchpad left of center, so to use the keyboard and touchpad comfortably it means you are about 2 - 2.5 inches left of center. For some this may be annoying or hard to get used to, but since I rarely sit directly centered in front of my TV it was easy to adjust to.Overall the pros greatly outweigh the cons and I significantly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable laptop for business/school use.::apatrevi::5.0::March 4, 2012
RTJRJ0CM41RI7::Do not purchase Lenovo.... ever::I will start by saying I don't know if you can purchase the B575 any longer, but after the experiences I have had with it I will not purchase a Lenovo anything ever again. I have hated it since day one, being conned into purchasing it at Best Buy in lieu of a Toshiba (they were sold out the day the ad came out). I had my previous cheap Toshiba (the cheapest version) for 4.5 years and felt I got a good run out of it. I used it for web surfing, emails, and downloading/editing pictures. Since this had twice the RAM I thought I'd give it a try. I have hated it since I turned on it and it took 2.5min to open to my desktop. It asked if I wanted to optimize, and I did. I have now optimized 6 times in the 8 months I have owned it, as it has never booted in less than a Min and a half. Usually taking around 2 min. That was irritating, but the touch pad is the WORST. I have had entire pages written in an email or Christmas letter, only to accidentally brush the pad with my right hand and lose EVERYTHING. Don't even know how that's possible. It also re-sizes the screen constantly. Recently I was traveling and assume my screen was damaged/cracked in transit. I have contacted tech support and did live chat on their website, and received no answers on what my options were. Apparently their one year warranty covers everything EXCEPT the screen. Each rep referred me elsewhere, and not to the same place. Turns out my instincts were correct, I feel like I have been ripped off. I don't have crazy high standards or high demands of my laptop, but this particular computer has caused nothing but grief.::Christopher::1.0::June 2, 2013
R1VNV1RCPZ15RO::OK but NOT if you plan to upgrade to Windows 7 Pro::We bought this system to be an inexpansive instrument controller. Was OK out of the box (keyboard layout takes a little getting used to, but bright screen, light, long battery life). However, when some BSODs occurred, our IT techs recommended an upgrade from Win 7 Home to Win 7 Pro both for better security as well as program compatibility.As we have since learned from searching online as well as our experience, the B575 does NOT handle clean installs of Win 7 Pro (even with complete driver sets downloaded from the Lenovo support site). The are two major problems:1) Power downs don't work right. No matter how you power down the unit (hibernate, sleep, etc.) the only way to get the system back is to hold down the power button for ~10 seconds, thus causing a hard power off and requiring a cold restart. Nothing else works. At all. Unless you do a hard power down right away, the system will also stay in some kind of sleep mode until the battery drains.2) Wireless access requires a workaround each time you boot. If you autoboot, the system will see the wireless card and claim it is working OK, but WILL NOT be able to see any networks, and there will be a red X through the wireless icon. Nothing you do can fix it. The ONLY way to make it work is to hit F12 during the cold boot sequence and enter the boot manager. When you do that, select either "start from hard disk" or "Windows boot manager" (doesn't matter which) and the wireless will work when the boot completes. Go figure. If you miss the 2-3 second window for hitting F12 (as indicated by bottom line of boot screen) you will need to restart and try again.Lenovo's only response so far has been to offer to sell us (for $89) Win 7 Home DVD's along with a migration to Win 7 Pro. In response, our IT department's response is to shake their heads and steer people away from these laptops. Clearly Lenovo's loss.I'm hoping some improved drivers will be made available soon (I'd add another start if that happens), but Lenovo tech support didn't seem to be aware of the problem, despite similar postings on the Lenovo user community website.::A regular::3.0::September 19, 2011
R1HRKEL5SL6I9C::Very Nice Laptop ... Great Price::I'm a big fan of Lenovo(IBM) products and this "refurbished" laptop did not disappoint.Big bang for the buck. Plenty of features for such a small price, and it was ready to go right out of the box.::Ed Lohrer e3_prog "progressive music fan"::5.0::May 1, 2013
R2543AX9BNZPRC::Good Product::Good for basic computer use, download music, videos, burning copies, good performance, not great speed but for the price it was a better buy than comparable Toshiba, dell and others::joseph::5.0::December 4, 2012
RS9LJB1Y6FZTX::Not exactly durable::I didn't buy this from Amazon.  I got it at our local Best Buy for $300 when it first came out.  I didn't even need a laptop, but for that price, I figured I would eventually find a use for it.  So, I used it about 4 times.  It's been on a shelf for the past 6 months.  I went to use it again a few days ago and that's when the problems started.  Windows kept crashing, which was the first problem.  The battery was the second problem.  It said 91% and charging, but it certainly was not charging.  I replaced the battery and it said "plugged in, not charging".  Then it continued to crash and reset everything that I had attempted.  When I first got the laptop, I knew that there were some hardware problems.  Specifically, it would not maintain a WiFi connection.  The adapter kept failing and the system would require a reboot after 10 minutes or so to get the adapter to fire up again.  I took it apart tonight to get a good look at it.  Quite a few of the cords were pinched and there were some burn spots on the boards.  I couldn't help but think that this was a fire waiting to happen.  I have no doubt that I managed to get a defective unit.  Unfortunately, it's out of warranty.::Jamie "mjam"::1.0::November 2, 2012
R2RAO74RO6JH60::good at first, but now...::Okay, so my mom bought me this laptop in November, and at first I loved it. The touch pad and DVD opener are a little sensitive (if my hand so much as grazes the dvd part it pops open.) But I had no real problems. However, just yesterday, I plugged up my laptop for charge, and after a couple of hours upon trying to turn it on, it wouldn't boot up. I at first thought maybe something was wrong with the charger and it wasjust dead, but I took it to best buy and they said its a probelm with the battery and will take about 2 weeks to fix, because they have to ship it to Lenovo. Thankfully it is still under warrenty, but since I am in college it is kind of a hassel to go 2 weeks without a laptop. I have been very careful with this laptop, and it wasn't my outlet that destroyed the battery. I will be looking for a new one once I get the money. Fantastic if you don't plan on using it a lot...::spencer::3.0::September 9, 2012
R3MYVSZIM5GT01::Finally a Notebook::Finally a device arrived that's worth to be called a notebook. The unit packs a powerful punch of CPU, fast memory and solid state storage which is finally starting to reach practical capacities and capabilities. The top end i7 model fully loaded (4GB RAM, 256GB SDD at the time) does easily rival a MacBook Pro, and outperforms my 2007 17" MacBook Pro (2.4GHz dual, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD with 4GB SDD cache). No moving parts other then the fan, which hardly comes on. The missing optical drive may throw you off originally but other then for software installation and burning the odd DVD you will hardly miss it during day-to-day use. In that case the optional USB drive doesn't break the bank, and if you have another Mac somewhere you can easily mount that drive remotely. The only downside, and I found this will all my MacBooks in the past, is the poor lighting of the displays, it's uneven and most noticeably darkens in corners and edges. I would understand burnout after years of use like mine that run 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, some 5+ years now. But not with a new device out of the box. There are more significantly lower priced Laptops out there that do a much better job in that area. Now, I use the unit as a business notebook with mainly commercial apps and a WIndows VM on top, so I can live with it, but it's still not acceptable at that price point.::Andi::4.0::July 19, 2012

R1TSYE36IBV7ZX::Just awesome::I am a college student who needs an easy laptop to class every time and I've always wanted a MAC for many years and finally crossed over from the PC world with a new MAC Airbook. It's thin, light with a nice screen, good keyboard, and beautiful battery life, it's exactly what I wanted, expected and got. At just under 3 lbs, I sometimes forget that it's in my computer bag. I love how thin and light it is, the super fast startup is also a plus, 256Gb SSD is awesome.  I absolutely love the battery life and the speed of this little machine. I would definitely recommend this unit it if you don't need an optical drive and a lot of storage.::Bill W.::5.0::June 10, 2012
R3JU2LNO5Q2835::A nice up-to-date replacement to IBM's old T43 ThinkPad...::Great little laptop that does most things well. It's not going to be a good gaming laptop due to the relatively underpowered integrated Intel 3D graphics, somewhat slow HDD, and small screen, but for general web surfing, streaming video playback, "light" gaming (i.e. Flash games), non-intensive photo editing (Photoshop Elements), and drawing in Inkscape (if you can stand the small screen), it's more than adequate.I  purchased my unit at 0ffi¢e Depot during the Black Friday sale week. In the course of my research, I found this identical unit was available direct from Lenovo's website during the summer for a price under 450 with various coupons.And just really quick, my list of negatives with this unit (which may not be negatives to you, depending...) and rational behind my 4-star rating: - no option for a lighted keyboard or keyboard downlight - no option for higher resolution screen - no numeric keypad, not even in the traditional laptop sense of pressing Fn+NumLock to switch the right side of the alpha-keyboard into numeric mode (this is a feature I used occasionally). - no option for a BluRay drive - no USB 3.0 -- not that I have a need for this yet, but it's a standard feature on many competing laptopsI liked this laptop so much, I purchased two E420 units (identical 1141-A24 models) and gave one to my dad, who has been using a well-worn IBM T-43 ThinkPad I handed down to him. I had a chance to compare the old school workhorse side-by-side with the E420 and made the following general observations: - The anti-reflective qualities of the matte-finish screens is comparable, but the E420 is brighter by a wide margin - The T43 had an "old school" 4:3 aspect ratio, vs. the wide screen 16:9 of the E420. This results in a narrower but taller screen for the older computer, but with a denser resolution (1400x1050) and more "room" vertically on the desktop. For most web surfing, photo editing and drawing, this older 4:3 is still the preferable aspect ratio. - The E420 is about ¾" wider than the T43, despite the T43 having a "bigger" 14.1-inch screen (this, again due to the aspect ratio) - Whereas the T43 had a parallel port, modem, PCMCIA slot and a PS2 Mouse Port, the E420 boasts an SD card reader, Bluetooth 3.0, 4 USB 2.0 ports, HDMI, eSATA, and a 34mm ExpressCard port. Similar features include fingerprint reader, TouchPoint controller, VGA-out, DVD-RW, and an Ethernet port. - Build quality still leans in favor of the old T43, but the E420 is no slouch. The T43 was nearly around ¾ pound heavier, but the body was slightly thinner and the screen more rigid. The E420 body feels "hollow" because it's just not as densely packed, and probably doesn't have the substantial metal subframe of the T43. However, the E420 is far and away stiffer and more rigid than my 2-year old Lenovo value-line G530, which has a flexy screen and feels "squishy" (like the bottom is pressing in) when I grip it. - The E420 has a larger touchpad and a keyboard that's closer to a real PC keyboard, not the "chiclet" style keys with minimal movement that the T43 features.The E420's Boot time is 35 seconds to the logon screen, and with a quick finger swipe over the fingerprint reader (this one works quickly and reliably!), it's fully booted and ready to use in under a minute. The Windows Experience Index registers at 5.7, singling out the hard disc as the bottleneck in the system speed, followed by the RAM read/write speeds. So a fast SSD would only marginally improve the overall WEI score, and couldn't make too much of an improvement to the boot times.The screen bright screen is great in the window-lit room I primarily use, and viewing angles are very good side-to-side. There is a sweet spot in the tilt that inverts quickly if not adjusted just so. Yet I find it acceptable for close-in viewing. Sound quality is decent, though not audiophile quality -- nothing worse than your average clock radio.Lenovo has placed most of the system functions (screen brightness, volume, web cam on/off, etc.) to the top-row function keys, then went one step further: they made the function key require a two-key press to activate (for example, instead of hitting F5 to refresh or F11 for full screen, I now have to press Fn-F5 or Fn-F11), but the auxiliary commands are now single-key press (press JUST F5 for the web cam). It's a little something to get used to, and it's a situation where a keyboard backlight would have been appreciated in darker settings to help me find my way.All ports to the sides of the body, with the exception of the RJ45 jack.  Thank goodness, no audio ports sticking out of the front edge. If you opt for the optional 9-cell battery, it would protrude out the rear by about an inch. And no more confusing the headphone port for the mic port: this computer uses a single integrated "smart" port, though I suppose it requires a new single plug (or USB) headset for my Skype calls.I am using this laptop successfully with HP's Wi-Fi Mobile Mouse, which requires Windows 7 + an up-to-date network chipset, and doesn't require any port-sucking USB dongles.The computer comes a little bit bloated with Lenovo's software, most of which is good, some of which is unnecessary. Fortunately, my biggest headache, Norton Anti-Virus, was easily removable via ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS. The others you'll have to pick through depending on what Lenovo features you'll find valuable. Lenovo even saw fit to ship this unit with Google Chrome installed, which manages to make an appearance before Microsoft's Internet Explorer has a chance to pop up. However, in my case, it was Chrome v12 (current version is 15), and it wouldn't automatically upgrade itself. I had to uninstall Chrome and download a clean version of the current software.A rundown of the included Lenovo software, most of which is optional to keep installed and/or use: - A quick boot utility that speeds boot times - An auto-lock feature that, if no inputs are sensed after a user-determined amount of time, turns on the web cam and looks for a face. If none is detected, it password locks the laptop. - An orientation sensing utility that allows the user to turn the unit sideways to read PDFs and other documents, automatically rotating those docs to fit the portrait view. - A recovery utility to burn a recovery disc from the hard drive's recovery partition. - The fingerprint reader software, which on this unit works reliably, usually on the first swipe, and is quick.Last thing worth mentioning: if you want a number pad and can stand an extra ~1½ in width, a version of the 15.5-inch E520 model has exactly the same spec (actually, with a faster 2430M processor) for almost exactly the same price. You'll get the num pad, but you'll still be stuck with the stock 1366x768 resolution, with no 1600x900 option available on Lenovo's website).For a computer I use daily for web surfing, video watching, some light Inkscape drawing, Photoshop Elements editing, and lightweight gaming, the E420 fits the bill in terms of price, value/quality, and speed/functionality. It's by no means cutting edge, it certainly isn't the best looking nor the smallest/lightest of the bunch, but it's designed to be carried around and used in any number of tasks with a minimum of headache. Five to six hour battery life is to be expected (unless under heavy video playback), and 9 hours are achievable with an upgrade to the extended 9-cell battery.::Nathaniel Allen::4.0::December 7, 2011
R10HMZMJEV8HMJ::Motherboard Died, Lenovo Support is Miserable::Just as the title says - my motherboard died after about 4 months of owning this laptop.  Lenovo had me ship the laptop out for repair, and took 4 weeks to finally ship it back.  They refused to be flexible with delivery and tried to ship it while I was on vacation.  Instead of leaving it for a family member to pick up later, Lenovo refused to change the shipping options and had it shipped back to themselves.  After contacting Lenovo support again I won't expect to be able to try this whole shipping disaster again for another 2 weeks.  From new to completely dead in 4 months is simply not OK.  Six weeks turn-around time on a completely dead laptop is simply not OK.  Since IBM stopped manufacturing Lenovo, quality has gone severely downhill.::Amazon Customer::1.0::March 5, 2012
R3QLEMOS5Q8TNO::WOW, Solid and comfortable::Compared to my 3 year old Acer 5515 this is a rocketship.As configured the WEI is 5.9, the HDD and memory are the bottlenecks.Keyboard is amazing, the touchpad is also great. The trackpoint, thaat is new to me and I am still working on it.Startup from fully off to any webpage is less than 1 minute.From sleep it is just seconds.The ThinkVantage Utilities are nice, makes updating very easy.I will be increasing the memory to max, and am considering a SSD for future installation.I dont replace computers that often, every 2 to 3 years, I fully expect this to last that long.I would, and have, reccomend this to anyone.::tgmotoman::5.0::January 29, 2012
R3QR3UGX51JOW0::Great machine!::Was able to find this particular configuration at a brick and mortar store with a much cheaper price than offered here. The laptop has a clean look. It's not the keyboard I know and love from my work T400, but the nubbin is right where it should be and I love it! Good battery, good WiFi, quiet fan, and great start-up time. Good little machine that easily out performs my wife's bigger and supposedly better spec'd HP from last year.If you can find the Core i5 model, go for it.::Jeremiah J. Mcglinsey "Homer Jay"::5.0::October 31, 2011
R3DH0U14MLNIFY::Was a great laptop... for five weeks::Update June 2012:  The computer died for a THIRD time... same problem... even though it had been used twice since arriving from being repaired.  Lenovo kept claiming it only had been repaired once (and sometimes never) and that a replacement wasn't an option.  They also kept claiming that my year-long warranty expired (after only eight months... several weeks of which they had the laptop in their facilities) and made me pay for an extended warranty to receive any service even though I provided a receipt and registered it when I bought it.  After weeks of waiting and submitting proof that I had the computer repaired before for the same problem, they relented in sending a new computer... though it took so long they sent a different model.Update March 2012: The computer did suddenly die again exactly as it did before in early January.  After going through weeks of trouble trying to get it fixed, it was finally fixed again.  I had to escalate the problem to get it repaired however.  It wasn't easy.  I've actually had to replace the computer since this one is gone more than with me and I need to get work done.Update November 2011: Lenovo did finally fix and ship the laptop back to me three weeks earlier than the 'earliest' possible date, but it was still gone for weeks.  In order to push the repair through to this earlier time I had to call nearly daily (waiting on hold for an average of 30 minutes each time) as well as send numerous e-mails.  They didn't automatically do anything to speed up the process and I'm not sure if the computer will suddenly die again at any minute, so I still recommend looking at a Toshiba instead.Update October 2011: The motherboard suddenly and completely died while safely resting in its bag (to the point I can't recover data without taking the machine apart and collecting the hard drive, which voids the warranty).  Lenovo has been quick to get a repair box out, but after quoting two days and promising six, they now won't tell me when I will see it back.  I've demoted the rating because a dead motherboard after less than two months is really sad, especially because I've been ultra-careful with it and it happened while it was turned off and unplugged between uses. Having a repair on a new laptop take several weeks longer than I've owned it is unacceptable.- - - - - - -Original Review in September 2011:This is a great sturdy and agile laptop for the price.  It includes features not easily found such as a non-glossy screen and fingerprint reader.  The hard drive while smaller than others in the same price range is much faster, which is more important when you are multitasking.  It is not extremely heavy and the screen is big enough to get things done while remaining portable. A big glossy screen may be great for watching movies, but this laptop wins if you are just trying to get work done.I have been using this computer to run word processors, engineering applications, and browse the web - all at the same time without trouble.  I have also installed a Linux partition and it runs dual boot easily.The computer does have extra features for when you are not working.  The fingerprint reader works great and is very convenient.  The webcam and mic work well and I thought the speakers were louder and clearer than other laptops I looked at in the same price range.Reading other reviews I wondered about the wifi.  I've found the wifi works great for me in all kinds of places (home, school, restaurants... secure and open) and I've had no issues all at in Windows.  If you load Linux, you need to make sure to turn on the wifi and get the settings correct.That being said, there are minor issues (that I didn't feel were big enough to rate lower based on my usage).  One is that the huge touchpad is great and aligned well, but it interferes with the keyboard and you must change your settings to turn it off while you type.  Another is that there are no hard drive lights - it would have been nice if the read dot of "Think Pad" on the keyboard did this rather than just stay on.  The battery didn't hold a charge well at first, but a few full discharges and recharges fixed that.  The DVD-combo drive is extremely loud and I definitely wouldn't be able to enjoy playing a video with it because it would be impossible to hear.  However for the few times I use these drives, it isn't a huge deal.  The power cord to the transformer comes out easily unless you plug it in REALLY tight.  Lastly, the function key is placed where I expect to find the left "Ctrl" key, which is annoying when I'm trying to use shortcuts to copy and paste.  I'm probably going to change the keyboard layout (in the operating systems) soon in order to deal with this.Pros: - Non-glossy screen for working in well-it areas - Windows starts up super fast and has great features for students and professionals - Fingerprint reader works great - Speakers are clear and loud - Fast spinning hard drive - Sturdy construction - Good size for carrying around in a backpackCons: - No hard drive working light - DVD drive is very loud - Function key is placed where the Control key should bePoints to keep in mind: - Wifi needs to be tweaked in Linux (works great in Windows out-of-the-box) - Touchpad settings much be adjusted to avoid problems when you type - Battery must be cycled when new to hold a charge well - You need to plug the cord into the transformer REALLY well for them to stay connectedOverall, I recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a computer mostly for serious work.  If you will be playing videos (especially from a DVD), then this probably isn't what you are looking for.::Melissa Morris::1.0::September 13, 2011
R1VLGGW5DAKRE9::One star is still too many!::I feel I must warn people about this computer. This computer has a known faulty system board which will sooner or later leave the owner with a perfectly useless laptop, myself being one of them. Lenovo ought to have recalled the entire batch of laptops to replace the faulty parts regardless of whether they were in warranty or not, simply to save their reputation. They failed to do so and consequently have most certainly lost my business for good. Sorry Lenovo.::S. Taylor::1.0::January 3, 2014
R1CJ1SQZGW2966::Great machine but the screen WAS too poor for me so I replaced it!!::It's a sad mistake on the part of Lenovo to make this wonderful fast laptop with a dim screen. It's not a terrible screen,.. It's clear and whatever.. But sitting next to my other laptops it looks blurry and dark.UPDATE!!!I was able to purchase the Glossy replacement screen for this Laptop on Amazon for a great low price and it was easy to change out..What a miracle!! The Matte screen that came with it was too dark and was actually really "terrible". Now that my Thinkpad E420 has the new Glossy screen installed,,, it is a Super Fantastic Laptop!!Update!!!I GAVE IT to my boyfriend who is a bit of a stupid ass. He said it looked like a toy! !I explained to him that it was not a toy..He uses it every day..Major::Major Steve Trevor::4.0::December 8, 2011
R1SEB5SOBPBW1C::excellent laptop::Bought one last year for working at home, watching movies on the internet, and traveling overseas (I do heavy work even when traveling so a tablet is not an option). So far I did not have any regret.The laptop is well designed and build. I brought it twice overseas without any issue. After one year of use, it is still working like a brand new one, even though I have installed tons of applications on it, which cannot be said of the other computers I have used.::Z.

R3H7A8GXSZUFN2::Great value at the given pricepoint!::I recently bought the Lenovo Thinkpad Edge E420 through Amazon. The seller (Circuitcity) was very responsive and delivered the item 2 days prior to the estimated delivery date based on my request :-)I've been using the laptop for the past few days and here's my objective assessment of its features. I've rated each feature on max of 5 stars (*****)Packaging- *****Product:  Setup for 1st use- ***** (setup was a breeze, came pre-installed with Win 7, took a total of 10-15 mins max)  Build- ***** (Feels solid)  Weight- ****  Screen- ****  Features- **** (Good webcam, fingerprint recognition and all the other bells and whistles. The speakers are not great and the max volume is pretty low)  Speed- ***** (Good config i5,4GB. Startup takes 10-12 secs. I always have multiple applications running and it has not shown any sign of lag)  Keyboard- **** (easy to use, flipping the default action of F keys with Fn+F is useful)  Battery- ***** (So far so good. On full charge the batters last for 4-4.5 hours)Overall the laptop is good buy at the $550 price point.::FooBar::5.0::February 12, 2012
R1ZE70RJU1DPII::It's known to die with no apparent cause ...::I had it for two months and it suddenly died. I've been very careful with it, thus I was very surprised.

And even having to repleace their mother boards several times...[...]::Jorge B "jiba"::1.0::February 4, 2012

R29UR6R6B54DH4::It's good, depending on what you do.::For the price and quality of the laptop, I say A+ for that. I enjoyed this computer refurbished for $114.97 from Ebay.com. However, after three months of use, the processor slowed up real bad. The computer's good and fast depending on what you do with it.Pros: Fast in the beginning, good for the price, all types of port (besides HDMI), and durable.Cons: Slow as it gets used for more than two months and sits in inactivity, Battery's terrible, Hinges are not great.Will list it on this listing.::Miles Prower::3.0::January 4, 2012
R1EW9Z12QY2BHK::Not bad for $100::The laptop came with only 45 minutes on the battery, and it's running an old verion of Windows (XP), but it's a nice, sold Dell, everything works, and anyway for $100 what do you expect?Bought it for my 3 boys for Xmas and now they're happily doing their homework on it, playing on-line games, and even watching DVDs. Most excellent.::Acier "Man of Steel"::5.0::December 31, 2011
R36RKAGZSFLCLF::long enough not to b able to return it::Im sure its a great laptop.  Id tell u more, but it wont boot up...  Haven't even had a chance to hook it up to the internet! This sucks!!!!::Javis::2.0::December 19, 2011
R1NKWIM0RKD125::Great Laptop for the price.::I received this laptop early today. It came packed to the point that it was a chore to take everything out, which was great since my product had no chance to mess up while in transit. Although I have only received this laptop today, I can already see that I love it.Pros:-The sound is truly wonderful. I played youtube songs on my laptop, and no matter how high, or how low I put it, it sounded crisp and clear. The DYNAUDIO works excellent. It makes you feel like you are really in a game, or if watching a movie, just sounds amazing.-Keyboard. The keyboard is excellent. The keys are nicely spaced apart, making it simple to type. It also comes with a keypad, which is excellent since there are many laptops of this size that don't have one.-The turbo fan works wonders. I played a game for around an hour, and unlike my old laptop that would get really hot after 20 minutes of playing, this laptop stayed cool throughout the entire hour. Although some people say the fan is loud, I could barely hear it while playing my game, and with headphones on, you won't even know it's on.-The Cinema Pro is amazing. It makes the colors sharper, more crisp. It really makes the movies, games, pages that you are looking at pop out. It is just absolutely beautiful.-The software on this game is great, as is the video card. I played L4D2, with all my settings maxed out. The game play was smooth, with not one hitch nor lag nor frame freeze. I loaded almost instantly into each new level, when it would take me a few minutes with my old laptop. The images are much nicer, the resolution amazing.-The keys are marked with arrows. You can tell it's a gaming laptop by how the red arrows point forward, backward, left, and right. It makes it much easier to find and use the buttons for moving about in the game.I haven't been able to thoroughly go and look through the entire laptop, so I will update this review once I do.Cons:-No instruction manual. Although many of you think no big deal, you will be surprised how difficult it is to navigate this laptop. Although the laptop does come with some papers explaining what the buttons are, they don't really go into detail on everything. So you have to figure it out as you go. And even if you have time to just press every button and see what it does, the same thing can't be said for everyone else. I prefer to start up windows, do the new software updates, and go.-The mouse pad is iffy. Mine is very touchy. If I touch it lightly, it will sometimes jump around the screen. Other times if I don't press hard enough it won't move. I solved this problem by using my wireless mouse. You can get a $15 wireless mouse and your problem will be solved. It doesn't bother me in the least.-I am personally having trouble with the text on my laptop. It is very small, and I've looked everywhere and I can't figure out how to change it. The laptop is hard if you are a beginner just for the fact that it has so many things going on in such a small packaged. So if you are really interested in this laptop, I would read up on laptops, and on MSi's just so you have a chance.Other then these small issues, I absolutely love this laptop. I happily forked over 1500 bucks for this baby. It does everything I was looking for, plus more. The features on this laptop exceeded my every expectation, as it will yours. If you are looking for a laptop with many features that really work, and amazing graphics at a decent price, this is the one for you.::Amazon Customer::5.0::September 7, 2011
R2JOQVWH9M7MAW::Happy with this purchase.::I needed a laptop on which to do video editing. My old machine could not handle the work at all.  This machine has all the power needed, and a large enough screen to see what I'm doing. There is so much RAM that my machine generally runs with 6 GB used at all times, but with only 20% of CPU usage. Awesome.Other reviews said the keyboard was not good. Wrong.  The keyboard is very nice, solid and quite.There are two things that I don't like: 1)  The keyboard is not backlit. I would greatly prefer a backlit keyboard. 2)  There is no light indicating if the caps light is on. 3)  There is no light indicating when the power cord is plugged in.In summary, it could be better in some small features, but it's got it where it counts.::Kevin S. Grail::4.0::October 21, 2012
RFVT8P7K4X3Q7::Not bad at all::I needed something more portable as I work 3rd shift security, so thought it would be good to have a laptop with me.  This is actually the best laptop I have ever owned.  It plays every game that I throw at it with no problems.  Plenty of ram, graphics ect ect.  When I go home, I hook it up in my room to my 37" Flat tv and watch netflix or crackle movies via HDMI connector.  The only thing that got me was it was a little expensive (for me)  I know that's not the fault of the seller.  I just wish Game laptops were a bit cheaper. I was willing to pay the extra cash so that I could have a decent video card though :)  No complaints, Meets and Exceeds Expectations.  Thanks MSI.. Will be using you again for all of my laptop needs.  Screw the Alienhead!::J. Kaeble::5.0::January 4, 2012
RTJZMD37RBZ5P::do not buy this laptop!!::This laptop absolutely sucks.  Within 2 weeks of buying it / using it, it gave up and threw in the towel.I fire it up and play for about 5 minutes and get some fuzzy lines and then the display cuts out. Backlight is still on, just a black screen. So I reboot- no screen at post. Then I think that maybe I didnt seat the mxm cards correctly/or needed to clean the contacts. Did that and fired it up while it was apart, got post. Turned it off, put it back together, no post. Took it apart again, searched google. I then noticed the the caps light was on, and the num and scroll were flashing. Followed a random response on google and reseated my ram. Post again, and again. Anyway, I'll be playing skyrim and my fans will kick up and fuzzy lines will come up lightly at first then really intense then stop completely. Sometimes when the fans are barely spinning.::Shiva Annamalai "khandesh"::1.0::November 20, 2011

R3REJF305ZB2Y6::Runs Mavericks!::I broke my White Macbook and I wanted a new one but I couldn't afford to buy new.  Some research pointed me to the Macbook Pro A 1266This is a old duo core machine that came with 2gb RAM and a 160 gb hard drive.  No spring chicken.  However it runs Mavericks which isthe latest OS from Apple as  of 2013.  Key is to add RAM.  It will accept up to 6gb of PC2 5300 RAM.  A SSD isn't a bad ideal aswell.  Some of you may be content with Snow Leopard or Lion but remember that Apple will pull support for those older OS X versions soon.You may continue to see updates but your system may not receive critical patches.  The Macbook Pro is the way too go.  They are moredurable then the White Macbooks.  These older machines tend to go for less then $300.00 and with RAM and SSD you could have a decent systemfor well under $500.00.  The really cool thing is Mavericks is FREE.  Compare that to Windows 8.1 which costs over $100.00Pros:  Inexpensive compared to used newer machines.  None of that case chipping bs of the White Macbooks.  Great screen.  Solid build and nice keyboard.  A cheap media card reader will allow you to add a SD card.  Supports Mavericks  OS X  10.9Cons:  Older and parts can be hard to find plus laptops of this age can just stop working and there is  no Applecare for them.  A bit on the heavy side and batteries may need to be replaced.  Costs more then comparable Windows laptops of the  same era.::I love Linux::5.0::November 4, 2013

R17IE9AEEI9K8W::Good basic computer for a good price::I purchased this Laptop in August from a major retailer and paid about $275 brand new. Its a good laptop for performing basic websurfing tasks and viewing pictures and videos. Nothing special no bells and whistles and not much to shout about. At a price of $275 this is to be expected...you get what you pay for and I knew this when I bought it. However keep in mind that the RAM, even though it comes stock at 2GB, is upgradeable up to 8GB. And RAM is honestly not that expensive or difficult to upgrade and boosts your memory, speed, and performance for less than $50 if your computer savvy or know a friend who is. You can also upgrade the graphics for less than $100 depending on if you really want a gaming machine or just to view a couple videos and the occasional game now and then. You can also upgrade the processor, but I would recommend a professional repair technician to handle changing out the CPU but upgrading from the stock 1 GHz Dual Core to a triple or quad core 2.5 GHz or greater would be worth it for the power and performance you could get, but thats up to you. Depending on what you are looking for, you can upgrade this laptop for alot less than buying a top notch performance system, and get at least equivelent performance. This is why I purchased this laptop to begin with...I plan on making those upgrades in the near future. Only issue Ive had is the LCD screen got a snowy red haze that showed up against certain colors, and found out that it was the screen itself going bad. But an LCD screen costs about $60 for the part, and I got a high gloss anti-glare finish replacement screen which shows color contrast better and shows up better in high light environments...so im happy and problem solved. Its a good starting point laptop to upgrade or for a kid starting out.::Cryssa::3.0::February 29, 2012
R1Z9FW1T09OA93::Don't Waste Your Money!!!!::Purchased this Toshiba at Christmas time. In three months the left hinge went bad, in 6 months the right hinge broke, which by the way, broke the led screen. Toshiba would not stand behind this even though it is still under warranty. We fixed that part ourselves now into the 8th month the motherboard has gone out. CRAZY HUH? We have sent it back again, lets see what excuse Toshiba has for not fixing it this time.I am a previous Toshiba user and have always loved them. NOT ANY MORE!!! Good luck to you if you choose to buy any of the redesigned toshiba laptops.::appraizer::1.0::August 13, 2012
R3EHUMYGBU62PH::Good Price for doing nothing::I bought this laptop thinking Satellite was very well made, but they cut every corner possible on this one. Here's a list of what I think:Pros:- Nice keyboard Layout- Has everything you need- Good sized screen- Lotta side ports if you need themCons:- Cheap plastic feeling (Compared to my Dell Inspiron or Acer 5516)- Track pad does not respond well- Track pad too small- Mouse buttons bevelled in and too close to the edge, annoying to right clickThe Biggest Negative:- It is extremely Slow.. Booting, Using, and especially multi-tasking.::Jesse B.::2.0::August 17, 2011

R3VF5Y1ZOF57KY::Great Deal::This computer is refurbished and looks brand new. Everything seems to work okay right out of the box. We are giving this as a graduation gift, so if there are any issues, we will soon find out. I own basically the same computer with an Intel 2 ghz dual core processor, and 4 gb of ram. This one has an AMD c-50 1 ghz processor and 2 gb of ram. If we have performance issues, I plan to upgrade to ram to 4 gb. This computer has the features of a laptop with the battery life of a netbook, or tablet. I remember these being sold at Walmart at a great price last year. I missed out on it then, but got another chance through Speedy Mobile.::Christian Philip Grace::5.0::August 9, 2012

R14FBRGDFGK9SX::Good laptop::Very affordable laptop(I bought it for $280 brand new, not the price listed above) and it doesn't dissapoint. I saw a couple of negative reviews and I completely disagree with them. It is NO slower than the average laptop in its price range. Overall  - it's light  - has comfortable keyboards  - doesn't overheat  - good HD video quality  - decent quality displayThe only con I see is that no matter how much its updated its windows experience index doesn't seem to improve. But at the same time, its performance is no different than the average laptop although it costs much less.It's not for gamers but it's definitely well fit for the basic stuff.The touchpad can be annoying. But overall I recommend it to anybody that wants to get a decent laptop which is reasonably priced.Anyways you must try to get it at the price I got it inorder to be as satisfied as I am :) Don't ask me where::Lilac::4.0::September 19, 2011
R3T0NHQPRKTQ92::ridiculously SLOWWWW & horrible lag!::Out of the box, it's clear that "dual core" means absolutley NOTHING with this thing! The multi-tasking is terrible because of lag. Performing 1 task is terrible because of lag! The touchpad's sensitivity/responsiveness is is horrible. Everything is all around slow, even at casual use.After installing updates & trying tweek settings, NOTHING IMPROVES!!!I bought this thinking I was going to finish setting up my website, after my primary laptop died mid-project. Seeing that it can BARELY handle casual tasks like youtube, facebook, email & websurfing.... I can't image trying to complete my project on this thing. Just the thought of that drains me!I was hoping to use this (because it was a cheap) temporarily until black friday, thenI would upgrade but I don't think I can handle this piece of crap until then...... it may be going back tonight.++++++++UPDATE++++++It in-fact, went back the next day.

She wanted a laptop computer and even with the cost of laptops being so low I wasn't looking to spend $300 for a new one.  She will be using this for school to do research, type up papers etc and this will more that fit the bill for her needs.  The only extra I needed to buy for it was a network dongle and its all set.

R1OF5WCFM6ADM4::Dell Latitude D810 Centrino M 1.73GHz Laptop Computer,... Dell Computers::We have three other computers in our home which we use for an in home business.  I bought this computer to have in my bedroom just for my personal use so the fact that it is slower and an older program makes no real difference to me.  I use it for writing, checking email and personal research.  It is very affordable and in my estimation perfect for student use.  It could even teach a youngster to be more resourceful and use this until they can buy their own expensive computer.  It really isn't that slow when you actually get signed in and started.Jeanne Wolfington.::Krystal Karen Hanson::4.0::August 30, 2013
R1PIXAAVWJF4YP::Very sturdy laptop.::I bought this laptop to replace a very lightweight Sony that had ran Vista and was starting to have issues, both with the software and the hardware (keyboard starting to act up). This Windows 7 Laptop is heavier but seems very well built.  I think I saw something about being built to military standards for durability standards (I could be wrong on this), but it seems as it very well could have been.  As it is now discontinued, I got it at a tremendous bargain, $600 versus $1200. I love the Windows 7 operating system and it's speed and ease of upgrading.  I upgraded memory from 4GB to 8GB for $33 from HP.  Very pleased with this laptop, no regrets. I bought it to use primarily as a business tool with client presentations.::J. Ross::4.0::June 21, 2013

R3SZNLMET9FVM2::It died within 4 months::This was my second HP laptop, first one was pretty good so I bought this one some months ago, I used it once a week barely for  an hour or two for checking my emails. I left it in a hibernate status once for a couple of days and then when I tried to restart it, it wouldn't start. It just died, talked to HP, they looked at it and they said it was a system failure and they could not replace it. I am very glad it happened within the first year and it was under warranty.HP staff was kind enough to replace it with another new laptop(different model). I think this issue has been happening with a large number of DV6 laptops so I would think twice before buying it. Also make sure you have extended warranty on this laptop.::Tayyab Kakar::1.0::July 13, 2012

But I am highly disappointed. I tend to believe that the issues I face is not very specific case for my particular unit but general problem with HP laptops.My first set back when I discovered that this HP product does not offer different color management, specifically Adobe RGB. I have all my photography equipment set at Adobe RGB, all my Dell notebooks offer many color management schemes, including Adobe RGB. So I can use this Pavilion dv6t for my photo need but with severe limitations. HP technical help could not offer any help.The main trouble started around 8 months after I purchased it. The computer became too slow and started hanging over frequently, leaving me frustrated. I lost many valuable data and research work due to that rampant and random hang ups. HP technical team diagnosed that it has bad hard drive. HP refused to replace the defective unit but repaired it. That took about a week.But the problem came back within a couple of months of repair. Again I am having the problem. A new problem also arose- the sound quality started deteriorating. Even at the highest volume, it is not much audible.Probably this is my last HP hardware.::J.

R1QRDI8VYKC7FM::Very stable and fast... but dont you dare play a game!::I just got this as a back to school computer.  Its been excellent and responsive in running all the MS Office programs and photo editing software I use.  But in your off hours, don't expect it to do much running any moderately recent games.  Despite impressive specs otherwise (considering the price) It has no video card.  You can run anything that runs in a window great, but don't expect to go full screen with World of Warcraft or anything.  Also, it sounds like it has one speaker... just one.... to the right.  If you might listen to music while you work, I recommend a set of desktop portable speakers.  I got the Razer ones myself and it works like a charm.Overall, great for work and school.  I'm happy.::Alexander lee Howell::4.0::September 3, 2011
R3JKR1J9JNL3ZV::Great notebook w/ great options for the price.::I really have no complaints with this notebook. I am on my second one as the first one I had, had a dvd tray that wouldn't close. The second one I got works perfectly.It's very fast, video playback is smooth, sound quality is very good (as laptops go). Has plenty of memory to run a multitude of things in the background and then some. I haven't experienced any lag yet and I typically have multiple windows and programs running.The aesthetics of the notebook are amazing I love the swirled aluminum affect, it gives it a really nice solid feel and a cool touch.The keyboard is very nice, no wiggle in the keys that so many laptops have. Everything on the notebook feels very solid.Battery life is far above average I would say I get a solid 8 hours with moderate use, mostly internet surfing with a 30 min show or 2.Heat displacement hasn't been to bad my left leg gets a little warm sometimes but for the most part the notebook stays nice and cool.Screen is very bright and has very good contrast.The graphics are kind of weak if your expecting to play any major games off it. e.g. Battlefield, WoW, Homefront, etc...Have not used the built in WiDi yet but I can't wait to try it; awesome option to have! WiMax works great on 4G. The WiFi range is good overall will pick up from quite a distance.Overall I am very pleased with this notebook and would certainly recommend it to a friend. Previous reviews show some malfunction of hardware but sometimes bad things happen to good electronics. Don't let one or two bad reviews sway you from a really nice notebook.::kewlkarz::5.0::September 6, 2011
R32NNDZGYMBJ3A::Faltered  right out of the gate::Purchased mine almost one month ago.  Worked when I took it out of the box, but failed latter the next day after leaving on the charger overnight.  I removed the battery and held the power one button for several minutes to clear anything, reinstalled the battery and hooked up the AC adapter.  And it worked, until this past evening.  Same thing happen again.  Repeated the same steps and no results.  Called Asus and they indicated that it needs to be sent back to the factory in CA for repair.  So off it goes at my expense.The only complaint I have found with this model was the sound quality, which for me wasn't critical.  However, this power failure on POST is a major issue.  Will add more, once I get it back, hopefully within 30 days, which I find complete and totally unacceptable.Would I purchase this item again, probably not!::kphar::1.0::August 24, 2011
RWR0VS454TA8W::Beware: No longer a quality product::ASUS cut corners to deliver a low-price, light weight laptop.The hinges were flimsy and broke under normal opening and closing. The track pad buttons wore out fast.  And the speakers were really bad.Other than the backlit keyboard, the changes on the new models are basically attempts to fix these workmanship and construction problems.The problem is that when the machine breaks, it will not be covered under the standard warranty.  That's a big problem.  Because when it breaks down - and it will - whatever money you saved up front will be lost in repair fees.ASUS used to stand apart as a quality product at a reasonable price and with excellent warranty support.No longer.Now they are an average product at a decent price and with poor warranty service.If you are going to buy this, get an extended warranty that covers any form of breakage.  They will look for a loophole to not cover the device.Buyer beware::andrew zatlin::3.0::July 6, 2012
RP6NH9V6PB5XC::Great Laptop!!::You cant find a laptop with these specs for the price!! I did alot of research and ended up with Asus. The Asus U-46 has a metal finish giving it a very solid and durable feel. It is ultra thin and modern looking as well. This laptop is not for a serious gamer but perfect for your everyday business person or student. I call it the Mac of Pc's. PC Magazine gave this laptop great reviews also. I love it so far and very impressed with the quality.::MV::5.0::September 20, 2011
R3DN6VF8C87G99::IMPOSSIBLE to get LCD replacement::Should you decide to purchase this laptop, pray that nothing happens to the LCD.It is impossible to find the replacement LCD, literally - not available from anywhere or anyone, including Asus.Consider yourself warned.::division by 0::1.0::October 24, 2012
R1IRZ9OHTMPO57::Good buy::Excellent laptop for general use. Good price for RAM, processor and Hard Drive. Superb Battery life.Lack of good graphics, and speakers only in the right side.::rober58::4.0::May 24, 2012
R3GG5ZFPA3QSK6::BEST BUY::The notebook is one of the best that I have bought in a long time.  It is fast, doesn't get hot, lot of space. Perfect for home and work use.The only disadvantage is, it is a bit heavy.::Liezel Ernst::5.0::September 22, 2011
R36UF973XSXSV5::Great right up until the hinge breaks::The Asus is really a great laptop when it come to the specs. It has a great build except for two things: (1) The hinge is horrible. It is plastic and bound to break even with light use over time. This is an engineering defect as opposed to anything you might do to the laptop. This would be fine, but getting it replaced was hell and I would rather have gotten a cheaper laptop given what I ended up paying for it. Asus warranty department was NOT helpful. In fact, they wanted me to send the laptop in for $70 plus paying for my own shipping to diagnose the laptop and whether it would fall under warranty. This is the last time that I will be purchasing an Asus product. Look up Asus hinge problems and you will find a lot of stories.::Yayness130::2.0::April 16, 2013
R3IZ19EDUQBCKD::returned after 1 day::I bought this locally for $700 and returned it in under 24 hours. While the design is nice and it seemed like a great deal, the display is awful. Initially I'd say it looked washed out. Reading or viewing anything with a white background was hard on the eyes. I tried adjusting settings with no improvement. Video display was also very low quality, appearing pixelated and grainy.::Amazon Customer::1.0::December 27, 2011
R2HKOI8RYNGXO3::Solid and Attractive With one Major Flaw::The U56e is a sleek, aluminum-body unit with an excellent keyboard. Altogether very solid and attractive. Processor is fast enough and memory is more than enough. Battery is phenomenal.But there is a serious flaw with the Elan touchpad: it's very erratic and unstable. It jerks around, frequently opening apps you didn't intend to, or straying around your document. While I'd done my due diligence research on this unit before purchasing, it wasn't until I'd delved into some geek forums that I discovered others making the same complaint. Several expressed astonishment that ASUS has been letting this flaw pass for years now.After reporting this problem to ASUS support, they instructed me to reinstall the touchpad and load BIOS default. I did this, but it didn't correct the problem, which I assume is uncorrectable after reading about it in the forums. In the end, I bought an external wireless mouse.I wish I could recommend ASUS to friends, but this mouse issue is so fundamental, I cannot do so. And it is truly jawdropping that ASUS would let this problem go on for years without intervention.::JAMES BRUNO "Master of the Political Thri...::2.0::March 29, 2012
R3EN8Q6OWDGUY0::ASUS i-5, 2410M 2.3GHz, 8GB RAM, 750GB HD, Win7 Home Prem::I've had this laptop about 3 mos.  For the most part I love it.  It's fast, clear, thin, light, and doesn't get hot.  I've had it on my lap for about 1 hour and it's fine - barely warm.  Yes, the battery makes it heavier, but compared to other laptops the same size it's great.  I love the full keyboard with number pad.The mouse pad is okay - not as smooth or large as macs, but better than most PC mouse pads.  I use it with a wireless mouse - they are cheap and very good these days.  There's a youtube vid on this laptop and the guy comments that the dvd drive is very sensitive - I haven't used mine for burning yet.  The speakers are definitely small - but I think they had to do this to get the profile so thin.  If you use a laptop for music you should probably have separate speakers anyway.::Atlanta Guy "In Atlanta"::4.0::February 4, 2012
R21RFYC6UGPYJV::Great laptop, but you can find better at this price range.::I bought this product about a year ago from a big box store for about $500 during a sale.  Overall I have been very happy with the product.The greatest appeal to this laptop is it's power and it's battery life.On a full charge this thing can go about five hours.  And while you may not have a the best processor or video card, I can still play games like Oblivion and Starcraft II on it at decent quality.Like others have said, the touch pad is a bit too sensitive.  I have often bumped it and unintentionally clicked things.I have used the laptop heavily for a year and a half now and the battery is beginning to show it's wear.  It's only doing about 3 hours on a full charge now.My only other gripe is cosmetic.  Some of the letters too quickly wore off.  The left mouse button got worn as well.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.  The laptop runs quickly, quietly, and coolly.::Zone::3.0::December 23, 2012
RGEEDQTUUND16::Really enjoying this laptop!::I have had this laptop for 3 months and got it at Best Buy out of the box. Really, like the keyboard and the design of it and it has been excellent for my online courses. I have minitap and SAS software on here and it runs very smoothly. I will be adding some photoshop software to this laptop and will be using it just about every day. Would definetly buy this laptop and probably another ASUS in the future.::Bob::5.0::March 4, 2012
R23FFBFM4IWO27::ASUS Motherboard failed prematurely::I bought a U56E-BBL5 last year and the motherboard began to fail at about 13 months (unit kept randomly shutting itself off).  By 16 months, the motherboard rendered the laptop unusable. ASUS would not honor the repair even though the unit was just a few months out of warranty.  In my opinion, the motherboard was not manufactured to be a durable component and spoils the good features of the laptop since it is not usable without an expensive repair (around $400).  ASUS had an opportunity to practice good citizenship and take responsibility for the substandard component but chose not to.  I have seen a number of identical complaints involving some ASUS motherboards.::Grahamm::1.0::December 18, 2012
R371AN0H8V430K::The Thorn Brings Down the Lion of a Machine::Purchased for $630 at Best Buy Feb2012. Absolutely loved this laptop when compared to other similar units for the price. Unfortunately, after 3 months of breaking it in, I would recommend looking for something else.Wanted to get to the I5 processor level and wanted to get away from a history of HP purchases. ASUS had a good reputation so for the price, the U56E seemed like a great deal.I can't stress enough how absolutely annoying the touchpad is. I have tweaked the ELAN software infinitely and can't find a setting that is comfortable. Scrolling is the worst. ELAN breaks from the traditional regions model and replaces it with finger gestures that they should have tested on a focus group or something. Instead of scrolling with one finger on the right side of the touchpad, it takes two fingers anywhere on the pad. Scrolling is very jittery and unstable. It's distracting enough that I will use the arrow buttons to scroll down instead of using the touchpad.Additionally, and even worse, it is a nightmare tapping a link. The touchpad is so oversensitive I have actually moved the pointer without even touching the pad. My finger hovered right over it and moved the pointer. So when you think you are clicking on a link it moves the pointer ever so slightly away from the intended link and you end up repositioning the pointer AGAIN and trying to tap the link. I've done this up to three or four times to try and get to the same link. This alone negates my desire to ever purchase an ASUS product again as research on this problem shows it is not fixable, adjustable, and is widespread.PROS:1.Wonderful battery life. Never as long as the meter shows but 6 to 7 hours is a given2.Great feel when typing. The smooth texture on the bottom part of the laptop is a pleasure to type with3.Charges quickly.4.USB 3.0 allows for fast charging for phones, IPODS, etc.5.Great specs for Hard Drive and Memory.6.VERY quiet and never gets hotCons:1.Touchpad -worst I've ever experienced. This alone makes me regret purchase2.Keyboard-Loved the chiclet keys in the store and still like to type on it but find I make many more typing mistakes than a conventional keyboard.3.Keyboard layout -Terrible layout. Common features such as Volume Control, Wifi on/off require a Function button to be used. Very annoying. There is a full number pad but it is so compact that it isn't really an advantage to have it. Plus, due to the addition of the number pad, the placement of the arrow keys, the home,end,delete, pageup/down keys are in weird spots. Really bad if you are a heavy Excel keyboard user.4.Speakers are a joke. They might have been fine if the placement was not UNDER THE LAPTOP.Not sure what I would recommend in it's place but I would keep looking.::Dan W::3.0::April 22, 2012
RBELX6NO2TGJX::Earlier review retracted: 11 months later::In March of 2012, I bought this ASUS laptop and after testing it out for a few weeks, left a 4-star review on here saying how light and functional it was, despite the terrible speakers (underneath the laptop, guys? Seriously?). After owning it for 11 months, I've deleted that review and I'm here to warn you: this is one of the most unreliable and absolutely pathetic excuses for a computer I've ever seen. It began a few months after I bought it when it started shutting off randomly on its own, which got worse and worse until I decided to send it into the manufacturer's for repairs. They replaced the hard drive, but the problem actually persisted. After ruling out the possibility of a virus, software conflict, overheating issue, overcharging the battery, this leads me to believe that the hard drive itself has a fault and all laptops of this brand are similarly faulty (especially going by many of the reviews on here). The official Asus live chat was also unable to troubleshoot it. Very, very disappointed. Will not buy Asus again, and I urge everyone else to do the same.::Okoa::1.0::March 29, 2012

Like anything there will be one out there. Great thing is my second one has no issues! I use mine for surfing the web, watching movies, listening to music, some work, and some play. This computer is not a gaming computer but used more for other stuff. I was aware of this when I bought it. The graphics for the game are not the best, hence why they say it's not great for gaming. Two years having this laptop and no issue. Still holds battery charge like the first time I got it. If you want a computer that is going to last this is it! I am very surprised it has only 3 stars.I would definitely buy another one of these.::Amazon Customer::5.0::January 8, 2014
R2F75FWR8ITCR2::good computer, terrible laptop::I have an Asus U56E I5 processor 600 GB Hard drive and 6 GB ram.First my wireless stopped working. It would start fine and then just cut out. I have had to buy an external wireless card.  Then my computer started shutting off randomly if it was on battery. The battery would say that it was 80% full and then just shut off. It works great if you are always plugged in and have an Ethernet cable tho. Don't buy Asus.::Jonathan Miller::1.0::September 18, 2013
R29KUNU8YOMP25::Great buy laptop from Toshiba::I got this laptop in September 2011 at a great sale price as I was looking for a nw laptop that would handle HD videos and output them through an HDMI port. This laptop has the HDMI port and has many great features for the price, such as Pentium dual-core processor, webcam, 4gb RAM and 500GB HDD, a wide 15+ inch screen, and Toshiba's reputation for quality. It doesn't have a ton of software loaded on but that wasn't a concern for me. It runs smoothly and handles pretty much any task you can perform. The battery lasts pretty long and so far no heating up problems, which can plague some laptops. If this lasts as well as my last Toshiba laptop (which still runs OK after 7 years) then it will represent a great value for a portable computer.::Jed Shlackman::5.0::November 27, 2011
R2HOK7S04K6NUJ::Budget Laptop::I bought this laptop from OfficeMax when it was on sale for $369 - $50 in store coupon for computers a couple weeks ago for a total $319. The price triggered me to buy it since I needed a laptop with HDMI out to play movies, netflix, etc... on my TV.  For the price, the laptop is excellent.  It is fast enough for my purposes, and certainly has enough installed memory.My only concern is the quality of the LCD. I find it not very vibrant and the viewing angles are limited.  However, for $319, this was an excellent buy !!::Gary Armstrong "Hammerstein"::4.0::September 10, 2011

R3TFIXZQQKSHGJ::Only downside is it's weight.::I just got this laptop a few days ago and I love it. It came exactly as shown/described, with extras (Fingerprint reader anyone?). It also came a day earlier than said earliest arrival date could be, but I'm not sure if that's because I'm in California, or if that's just the way it ended up being.The swivel hinge seems very sturdy, although while in Laptop mode the screen may shake a bit, depending on the surface you put it on (Its more shaky when you have it in your lap versus having it on a desktop). The swivel turns only one way (counter clockwise from Laptop to Tablet, the opposite way Tablet to Laptop), and at the base of the hinge (whether in Tablet or Laptop mode) there is a small window showing which direction to turn it. Once you turn the computer into Tablet mode, you may hear a click, which are the magnetic (for lack of a better word,) connectors that secure the screen from moving around (there is a button on the lid of the laptop to disconnect them.I am a 10th grader, so I use my laptop to take notes and do homework on. Therefore, I tend to prefer Tablet mode. This is the main reason I picked a tablet. The only problem I can find with this laptop, is it's weight. It weighs about 6.5lbs, making it a "luggable" computers, but not necessarily "portable". If the user (like myself) doesn't mind the weight, it is over all a great computer.There are many features on a tablet that you cannot access on any other computer. Some include; Windows Journal, Ink Art, Ink Desktop, Ink Flashcards, and much much more. This computer does not come with Microsoft Office, so I downloaded Open Office (free). If you as a buyer wish to purchase Microsoft Office, go right ahead, but Open Office is free and can do the same.Overall, I believe this is a great product! I would reccommend it to any and all of my friends looking into a new computer. I have also gotten many positive and no negative comments on the computer form peers at school.UPDATE (3/14/12)We now have two of these computers in our house. My sister, who is in 9th grade got one recently and she is loving it. This computer is great with games, although video card may need to be upgraded sometime to support high quality, newer games. I can play World of Warcraft, and my sister plays Nancy Drew. We can also occasionally play the Sims 3, but with that, occasionally it overloads the video card, so I just have to be sure to save often. Still a great buy, although with my sister's it didn't come with the fingerprint reader or screen cleaner (But, it did come with everything that was shown.) Both of the laptops we bought came with the laptop case, but I suppose the company ran out and is offering something else. We plan to get one (possibly two) more of these laptops, one for my other sister, and possibly one for my mom. Still, a great buy!!::Leaianna::4.0::February 29, 2012

R2ACWXXKYH8C95::Not surprised.::This last two years I've had this laptop have exceeded my expectations but I'm not surprised, I have a good past with Acer computers. I have a desktop as well. I have noticed its gotten slower but probably from my own use. I use this daily and it's almost always on. 75% of the time plugged in. I can still unplug it and get 2 1/2-3 hours of use on battery saver mode (always been this way). It can handle a lot at once but it's not a high end gaming laptop. I can play Sims 3, with no mods, on moderate settings. It plays older games flawlessly though and runs photoshop very well. The only thing I hate is the keyboard. Junk gets under the keys and its hard to clean, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I'm a busy mom to a toddler and three hairy cats so it doesn't take long for stuff to gunk up my keys. Overall I'm happy with my choice to get it. I'm writing this review from it now =]::raynecloud1010::4.0::October 8, 2013

I have left this laptop in direct sunlight for long periods of time, Plus in frigid cold winters of Michigan it survived. Its been thrown around in my book bag etc... but through all of these demands it remains in tact and fast as ever. The screen has true HD graphics with a remarkable refresh rate for a personal computer.

No complaints and it was shipped promptly. Thanks!Update: After using it for a while, it's still holding up great. It is frustrating to use it at times because if you're a multitasker like myself, the laptop gets really bogged down. Really only recommend this laptop for light users. Won't run videos or programs like Photoshop well at all. Will upgrade the ram to 8gb to see if that remedies the issue.::C. DICKSON::4.0::August 27, 2013
R1BQDLV2V7LZIN::Not bad at all::I've had this computer about a year and a half, and I think it's pretty spiffy. I bought it at Walmart for $330-ish, I think. After about a year of using it with no problems, the hard drive crashed, and it needed replacing (about $200).What compelled me to write a review was the comments that the laptop hinges broke. I had the same problem with mine. The plastic at the hinges on the laptop base separated and the screen became loose. I couldn't close it without the computer making breaking noises. After a little examining, I realized that the one of the screws on the bottom of the laptop that hold the hinges to the plastic had came out. I "borrowed" a screw from a different part of the laptop (oops) and it's been fine since. If you have this laptop, I strongly suggest tightening the display hinge screws, which are located right underneath the hinges on the underside of the laptop, with a jeweler's screwdriver to make sure your screen doesn't get floppy, or so that you don't lose a screw entirely.::Benny::4.0::December 7, 2012
ROW8KNVOI6H40::don't buy it::Terrible. So slow, crashes constantly. Video is grainy. sound tinny. I haven't downloaded any viruses, looked at a single page of porn. Yet still it acts like it's been through the wars and i've only had it for 1 week. Don't buy it. With age I am really learning that you should'nt skimp on things. Most things that are cheap, are cheap for a good reason. Because they are terrible. DON'T buy it.::mynamesjon::1.0::February 6, 2014
R3B0COKMN2OSEN::Near Complete Piece of Garbage::I bought this Toshiba laptop brand new from a local big box vendor. Avoid buying the laptop if at all possible. If I could rate it at less than 1 star I would.Cons:1. Battery stopped charging less than 6 months after purchase. A replacement battery  from Toshiba requires a $176 holding charge on a credit card even though Toshiba customer  support never bothered to determine whether the problem was the battery or the latop itself.2. LCD screen broke after a tap to the *back* of the laptop. Toshiba's repair depot charged $325, nearly the cost of the laptop itself, to repair. I bought a screen here on Amazon for $72 and fixed it myself in 40 minutes.3. The absolute worst customer support I've ever come across.Pros:1. cheap and efficient if used for basics (web browsing, document handling).This is the last Toshiba item I'll ever purchase. Toshiba customer support and the product and customer support have been nothing short of infuriating.::L. Padron "lpadron"::1.0::March 3, 2012

We were NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN THE ITEM as we have attempted several times to contact the seller and have been IGNORED!!  The laptop is unusable and we already paid for it!!  We are extremely distraught and feel cheated by the seller, Secondipity, which will not only give a broken item to a customer, but ignore their request to return or exchange the computer.

Then the plastic pieces around bottom would pop apart every time I opened it.I bought this laptop for online use and word processing for college.

R77FNV5ET8LQ1::It Really Is A Piece of Garbage::Stuff like this really bothers me.  You pay a few hundreds of dollars for a computer, you expect it to last at least a year. This last about 3 months before it started crashing, failing, stalling, etc.  Toshiba does not include a recovery disk with the pc, in case it crashes. It's poorly made, inside and out.  Inside, it easily crashes, there's not enough space, the software stalling drove me insane, etc. Outside, I don't know what happened but I literally closed it one night after writing, went to open it the next day and it popped, the part where the power button is snapped lo0se from the base. It's just a cheap piece of crap and while I never expected miracles, I did expect it to last until the semester ended.  My first Toshiba was given to me, I bought this one on my own accord. Never again.::ArmyOfficer::1.0::April 18, 2014

R27JM8PD4E82UM::A Lot of Bang for Your Buck!::This laptop is absolutely amazing! I've actually come to love Acer laptops because they are reliable and affordable. I purchased this Acer Aspire 7551-7422 to upgrade from my Acer Aspire AS7736Z-4088.  I also wrote a review on that one as well. This particular model is slightly different but similar in specs to the Acer AS7741G-6426 that has the 2.66 GHz Intel Core i5-480M dual-core processor which makes it more expensive. It also has a 640 GB SATA hard drive (5400 RPM)and this Acer model has 500 GB SATA hard drive with a 2.2GHz Quad Core processor (AMD Phenom II X4 N970).I purchased this particular model at Walmart for $478.00 which I thought was a great deal.  I have this exact model. It's black with a mesh like top so you don't have to worry about all those nasty little finger prints! This computer is blazing fast. It even takes less than 30 seconds to boot up. My previous Acer laptop made a little bit more noise compared to this model.  This particular model is fairly quiet. You can barely hear it running.  I especially love the bright 17.3 screen.  It's absolutely beautiful! There is also a full numeric keypad and the keyboard has plenty of space. The keys are a nice size and have a spring like feel to them when pressed. The touchpad also has the multi-gesture feature where you can pinch and zoom ect. I don't particular like this feature.  I bought a new wireless mouse to use with the laptop. I have never really liked the touchpad on a laptop. I prefer to use multi-gestures on my iPad. I also wanted to say that I was a bit surprised by how light the laptop is.  I expected it to be much heavier. Acer did a really nice job with the build. It's a beautiful laptop at an affordable price.  You are getting a lot for the price. If you are on a budget and don't want to spend the extra $100-$200 on Intel processor, I would definitely go with this option.The only cons that I've noticed so far was that I only got just over 3 hours in battery life. There is also no Bluetooth which is a little disappointing. I got over it fairly quickly though.  I don't use Bluetooth that often on my laptop. I also felt that the speakers were a little weak. If sound quality is very important to you then I would invest in some good quality speakers if you're going to go with this laptop. The sound quality isn't terrible but it could definitely be a lot better.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase and feel like I got a lot of bang for my buck!

R14SD1HQ5RVC4Q::Not exactly the gaming laptop promised::PRO: AMD's FX Quad Core processor will definitely plow through your basic office tasks without hesitation.  After a bit of adjustment, the keyboard works quite well under normal conditions, and the trackpad is better than most I've dealt with.CON: Graphics is about average for student/home business use, unsuitable for gaming (no L3 cache, only 256 MB max memory, which is shared and set in the BIOS).  5400 RPM HDD is simply inappropriately slow for any use today.  Out of the box you will spend hours doing security updates on Windows 7 (typical for anything out of Microsoft the last couple of decades), or you can spend about a half hour installing Ubuntu Linux and not have to deal with that mess, I did both do to the need of a few Linux programs I use regularly.  There is no Bluetooth, something that I always thought to be standard on laptops the past few years (it created problems for me with several cameras that required it), but you can purchase the card separately and install it yourself if know how.  Battery life is nowhere near half what was promised, from power-on to shutdown I got a maximum of 73 minutes (a lot was wasted in the boot-up process) under Windows 7 Pro, 98 minutes under Ubuntu Studio (Linux), far short of the 180 minutes promised, and this under very strict energy settings.For business use, I can find no fault with this laptop, other than described above.  Unfortunately, I purchased this laptop for entertainment, to keep my mind off the size of the needles being stuck into my spine.  The slow hard drive, lack of L3 cache, and minimalist video memory combined to make playing any modern graphics-based games all but completely impossible.  Without Bluetooth, I was also forced to work strictly offline with any video I captured, and the Acer could only communicate with my Blackberry via USB or WiFi. rather than the preferred (and to my mind much more secure) Bluetooth.The only game I was able to get running was Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), a simulator I've been playing with for decades in various incarnations.  While FSX works just fine on my old Dell Studio 1737 (Pentium T3400), the Acer FX simply can't handle FSX due to the absence of any L3 cache at all, and the minimalist 256 MB vRAM didn't help matters.  Best frame rate under FSX recommended settings was 5 fps, just under 20 fps if I set all the display settings to absolute minimums (not very realistic at that point, more like an old arcade game).The upside I liked was the ability to upgrade the installed Win 7 Home Premium to the Professional version, something I needed in order to run certain XP based 32 bit programs I still need (no replacements for them yet), a feature that never worked right under Vista.  I also installed the Ubuntu Studio version of Linux, which deals with my cameras (when connected via USB) far better than Windows (any version).And, as usual for Microsoft, right out of the box I spent a long time doing "updates" on their latest software, mostly security issues that hackers were exploiting long before Windows 7 hit the marketplace here in the US.All in all, however, this Acer cost me half in 2012 what I paid for my old Dell Studio 1737 in early 2009, so I think I got an okay deal on this one.  Still, one must wonder what the good folks who built this thing were thinking when the hobbled the graphics so badly by omitting L3 and half the needed memory, especially in today's very graphics intensive computing environment.This computer is only suitable for basic student/home office functions that do not involve heavy graphics or unusually complex mathematical functions (even some Zynga games on Facebook fail to work well, go figure).  Those with such needs, or who are interested in a gaming laptop (which is what I was told I was getting) should consider another laptop and/or manufacturer.  Otherwise, not bad for what I paid.EDIT to add more information...The laptop gets very hot (220+ F) when room temperature is above 74 and doing anything that is graphics intensive, likely owing to the under-powered graphics built in.  The GPU is definitely the source of the heat buildup, and I strongly recommend downloading a utility program to shut the computer down if the heat exceeds 225 F (if you want the laptop to last very long).  As most already know, GPU's cannot be replaced on laptops.::D. Lipsitz::3.0::February 21, 2013
R29XFVYSOIUXC9::refurbished ACER 7551-7442::This was the cheapest by far amongst the various options for a Phenom Quad core 2.2 GHz and 17" or bigger screen.To give an idea: Frys was selling a refurbished laptop with Phenom with dual core for 150 dollars more and WalMart had the same one for around 80 dollars more.The look and feel was great - it looked and felt new. The downside was that the laptop came with a lot key drivers missing - starting with the wireless and LAN drivers. though there was a page with the information that buyers might have to download LAN and wireless drivers - it could have been more comprehensive. The ACER site has both Broadcom and Atheros as options for the same model and it was not clear as to which one needed to be downloaded.What they did not mention in their FAQ was that both the screen/display drivers, card reader drivers and audio drivers were not the recommended drivers but default ones from Windows. The Acer program for the web cam still does not work though the web cam works in skype and msn. There is also no firewire port.To be fair, Tech Turn the seller did have a help number to call but they work Monday to Friday and since I received it on Friday evening it was not much use to me.Once I got all the drivers set up - a solid three hours of trial and error and downloading and installing - straightforward stuff though - no need to be an expert - it works well and I am satisfied enough with the price / value of money equation to happily give 4 stars. (it is a solid 17.3" LED screen with a great quad core chip). TechTurn also had amazing delivery - I had super saver delivery in 4 days.Overall looks like a great Amazon purchase - fingers crossed - it is two weeks old as I write this review.::Niranjan Ramsunder "Niranjan"::4.0::February 2, 2012

R2R0RRBJL2BYK2::Great laptop. I wish it hadn't arrived damaged::This laptop is a beauty. The screen is huge. I so wanted this purchase to work out. Except for the weight, this would have been the ideal laptop for my daughter, who is going to school online.I bought it because I have my own Acer Aspire, (model 5740-5780) and I love it. These are great computers. Mine is just 15.6", so I was planning to spoil my daughter with this one with its 17" screen. I also wanted Windows 7, because for now Windows 8 is wonky. I've read that it will occasionally freeze when trying to do simple tasks, like saving a Word document. For now, Windows 7 is definitely the way to go.Acer Aspire, Windows 7, and a huge screen. What's not to love?Unfortunately, I bought it from an Amazon seller who didn't ship it with enough padding, so it arrived with one of the plastic corners broken off. I couldn't tell, but there might have been internal damage, as well. After a big headache, I was able to send it back to the seller, who refunded all the money including the cost of shipping both ways, with a little extra to compensate for the time and frustration. I ended up buying a smaller Acer Aspire (the same size as mine) from a different seller and getting it cleaned up at the "that was easy" place. She loves her new computer, but she still wishes this one had worked out. We both do.::Shevi "FantasyWeaver"::5.0::October 3, 2013

R2FMS8OVVG6IA9::Great Laptop, Horrible Battery life::I bought this laptop roughly 6 months ago. It's been a good unit. Awesome display, great CD/DVD burner and a reasonably fast processor. The Graphics card in this unit lets it down a bit if you try to use that big 17 inch screen to play games. It displays movies quite well and is a great movie machine.Overall, I'd have to say this has been a good laptop for home users. As an IT professional, I would suggest a smallerlaptop for my fellow IT workers. This one is heavy and the battery doesn't last long.::Rahn "SonicAnatidae"::4.0::September 18, 2012

About this particular model, it is super-fast, tons of hard drive storage & the 17.3" screen display is awesome! Comes with 4GB of RAM, added another 4GB to mine & now there's no slowing this puppy down. I love this laptop, it's built tough, very attractive design & will do just about anything a much more expensive laptop can do. I paid $478.00 for this one at Walmart right before Xmas 2011.

The webcam drivers were not installed on my refurbished unit and Acer has 2 diffirent web sites with driver downloads for it. one site worked, the other did not([...] did not). my 7551-7422 has the liteon version of the webcam, again both sites listed a driver download for this but it only worked from one of them.

R25TGB0QA91YZ8::some good, some bad::This is a reasonably fast computer with a decent display.As with other Acer laptops, there are two things to watch out for:- The spacing on the keyboard is somewhat tighter than on HP and Dell laptops; it can be hard to adjust to this.- Sound recordings, whether made using the internal microphone or an external microphone, are horribly distorted.  Curiously, this is true even if the recording level is set quite low.  I've tested this on laptops made by HP, Dell, and Asus, and got respectable sound quality on all three, so I'm guessing that there is a defect in the Acer motherboard chip set.::Phillip M.

R2RZSCPYGLQSG0::great for the price::I purchased this for a friend who never had a laptop and wanted to use SKYPE. So far it works great and he is very happy. I know it is not the fastest and has no HDMI but for the screen size and price its a great machine. I have had other Acers and have been very happy::D. R. Hilson::5.0::August 8, 2012
R2THCVM4DCLC53::love it::Love this computer works great nice picture has everything I want in it have had no problems with it. great value::kat65::5.0::July 19, 2012
R12GRHI2SEHAW1::Was happy - now not so sure::Second hard drive failure since purchased new in Dec 2011.  Love it otherwise, but retuning it every three months (and it takes about three weeks to get it back) is quite annoying.  Then the tech service people - English is not the first language.  Very helpful having them spell words so I can understand what they are saying  (NOT).So at this rate I will have use of it for nine out of every twelve months.  YAY!!Finally fourth person I spoke to was a "high level" tech.  He spoke English!!!!  Said unusual for it to fail twice and if it does it again they will test more in depth.  Hey - why not do that now??Anyway - maybe I just got a lemon one - cause other than this it meets all my needs at a decent price.::justme::3.0::July 5, 2012
R125VJ8OBWLORG::Gets the job done!::Nice sleek look, easy to navigate, windows tend to freeze or become unresponsive quite easily, battery life less than stipulate 5hrs. Purchased for tertiary studies, so it's getting the job done.::Raynell R. Aberdeen "Ray"::3.0::June 25, 2012
R227WPV6TIJUAY::Great bang for the buck, Acer has good rep-::I bought this for my brother who basically needed a decent laptop for a very affordable price.  He wanted to surf, email, write, etc.  USB ports were plentiful, he needed no HDMI or aluminum casing or 4.5-6 hr battery life as all this would have jumped the price from $350!!! to $850, hello?  I dont know what reviewers expect for a $350 laptop, really...unless you go refurbished and maybe grab something which was used briefly, defective, repaired and labeled as inspected/repaired (and i hear decent things about refurbs) you arent going to get alot of expensive features..which is why youre going cheap in the 1st place right?  Also, some people are real noobs when it comes to problems on computers and go off and use reviews to rant.  Seriously, get a hobby and some therapy.  We all get a lemon now and again, the law of statistics.  Some companies have so so Customer svs. I wouldnt know about Acer's as ive never needed to call.  I was a lucky one or an avg one i guess.  Ive had Acer monitors for business office, Acer products and now the Acer laptop for my bro.  All have been satisfactory.  dont not buy something because one person has the bad luck to receive a lemon.  Would you stop buying a toyota or honda vehicle because one person had a wheel axle not function, called Customer svs on a busy, horrible day when stars werent aligned and then say...whooooa! I aint gonna buy no more Toyota cars, uuum yep.  No I would hope you wouldnt.  Acer is a good co. just like ASUS, they offer premium products for less $ and often out do the Dells HP's and most of the old timers in the business.  They have to...they are lesser known and are not on tv spending gajillions advertising.  Take it from a level headed, highly experienced tech geek who builds her own computers and services everybody elses.  Do more than read on peoples reviews who often know little and expect alot from things.  Decide what you want, your budget, the prod features and then Google reviews by computer pros on a product if they can be found.  Go to the mfg website and also read features and detailed specs like how fast the CPU is and how big the hard drive is, how much ram it has and is that in one slot or divided in to the two slots.  Then be fair and if someone gets bad luck, realize too that there might be one bad apple but it doesnt color the entire product line or model.  So far my brother loves his Acer laptop and I loved the price as big sis had to buy him one so he had something to work on and Skype back n' forth so we could stay in touch.  Go for it! By the way N*wegg has this on sale for $349 now.  A no brainer...::Phebe Hart "techno geek"::4.0::March 26, 2012
R1F1D6ZMFCZUTQ::Good budget laptop::It was at the bottom end of performance and features among new laptops when I purchased.  With that the context, I thought it a 5 / 5 based on the value I was getting for the price I paid.  Acers have proven good computers over quite a few years.  Mine worked as expected.  Quite well.This model could be found for $300 at retail in early May 2012, and was probably being discontinued and liquidated::Sack Peterson::5.0::May 14, 2012
RJZO1633QOQD9::MY ACER AS5733Z-4469 SUCK!!!!::i do not recommend buying an ACER or accepting a FREE ACER............my cd drive stopped working after 6 months, slow to get on the internet, font keeps changing while you are typing........apps changes back and forth while you are using it...........IT IS THE WORST COMPUTER THAT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.......EVEN WORSE THAN A DELL!::rita ward::1.0::February 11, 2013

RLDYIUSQKTFJ8::CNE, MCP, MCSE, A+ PC Tech Review::Before you even think about buying an Acer computer you should at least stop and read this transcript of my attempt to service an Acer laptop with a serious hardware issue still under warranty:Status: ConnectedDharan Manu (Listening)Jimmy Jose: Hi, my name isJimmy Jose. How may I help you?Mark: * Case #PAC40094  * Case #PAC40443Mark: I put in the first case number above, spent an hour explaining my issue and then the case was closed when I went in to see the status. No one contacted me and yet they closed the case.Mark: I put in my address in Yellowstone, the address of the [place I work] in Yellowstone, but both times it said "Invalid Address". So, now I have had to use a friend's address in nearby Gardiner.Mark: I have worked with Dell and HP customer support for 12 years and never had this kind of experience in not being responded to.Jimmy Jose: I apologize for the inconvenience happened.Mark: This laptop has a serious issue that must be hardware related. For one, I took it back to the factory defaults and still had the exact same problem with it freezing up when the fan comes on.Jimmy Jose: I understand that you have created repair order and unable to open the case foe detailed explanation.Mark: "foe" what?Mark: Why can't I open a case with Acer, with a laptop that's still under warranty????Jimmy Jose: Mark, your case ID is waiting for approval.Jimmy Jose: After getting approval, you can edit the case notes.Mark: That's because I just opened a second case a few minutes ago. Tell me why the first case was closed with absolutely NO EXPLANATION???Jimmy Jose: You was not suppose to open a case at that time.Jimmy Jose: Sorry for the typo.Mark: What do you mean "I was not suppose to open a case at that time"???Mark: What else am I supposed to do if I open a case and Acer closes it before doing anything about it?Jimmy Jose: Unfortunately you have no option to open two cases at a time.Mark: So, are you saying that Acer can close a case with no explanation and I can't open a second case???I then, asked to speak to his manager and it took about a half hour to get it across to him that I had not sent the laptop in and had it returned, but was simply trying to open a ticket for the first time. I explained to him that I took the laptop back to its factory defaults and it still freezes up and hesitates whenever the fan turns on, although it is somewhat better when the battery is not in it. After an hour, all he could do for me is give me a phone number to call tomorrow...MY ADVICE TO YOU IS NOT TO PURCHASE AN ACER COMPUTER! I SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE STUFFING THE BALLOT WITH FIVE STAR REVIEWS FROM IMAGINARY CUSTOMERS AND HAVE DESIGN PROBLEMS IN MANY OF THEIR MODELS. ITS THE WORSE COMPUTER I'VE EVER DEALT WITH AND AS A DESKTOP TECHNICIAN FOR OVER A DECADE, I HAVE WORKED WITH DELL AND HP SUPPORT HUNDREDS OF TIMES, PURCHASED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF COMPUTERS, SKIP-JUMPED OVER MOST HARDWARE ISSUES WHEN TALKING TO TECH SUPPORT AND NEVER BEEN TREATED IN SUCH A MANNER BY EITHER HP OR DELL. I AM WARNING YOU NOT TO BUY ONE OF THESE PC'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE INEXPENSIVE AND TO BE AWARE THAT THEY HAVE NO CONCEPT OF HOW TO SUPPORT THEIR CUSTOMERS.::Mark::1.0::January 30, 2012
R16H1MC50933VO::Very nice laptop::I've only been using this laptop for a few days. But it's a winner. Great screen, speakers,keyboard,webcam,very easy to set up. Windows 7 is a snap to use. (I've been using Vista, before that XP Pro and XP.)The laptop comes with 4gb of ram. I ordered two 4gb. to increase the ram to 8gb. I found the upgrade here on Amazon for only $29. That's cheap enough. I would recommend Acer to anyone that wants a good computer that doesn't cost a lot of money.::Gordon S. Ferris::5.0::November 24, 2011
R3LD34H1YE97A8::Best value at $379.::After looking at laptops for several months I finally settled on this little beauty. This is my first laptop and I have fallen in love with it. I wanted a machine to use "Push 2 TV" with and kiss my cable bill goodbye and I did just that. Life is good! Caught this Acer on sale at Micro Center for $379 and I couldn't be happier. If you're thinking about this one, get it. You won't be sorry especially at $379.::mralan::5.0::December 1, 2011
R2ZWSQ8BMCVCOX::Great Deal::I bought this laptop a year ago. My laptop died and I needed a new one quick. Money was tight and so I shopped around(big box stores, online, etc...) and I kept coming back to this one. I love this computer it exceeded my expectations. I waited a year to review because I feel this is the best way to measure how well an electronic device works. It's easy to write a good review 3 days after you bought something when it is still shiny new. This laptop took a beating and still runs prefect, not one issue. I use it for work and school everyday for at least three hours at a time. Acer makes a great product at a great price. Don't let the low price fool you this was well worth the $500. I ran ArcGIS 9.3 (full version)right out of the box no problem. I also used it for class on 3d game design and 3d online worlds, not one hiccup.I bought this as a cheap stop gap measure to get me by till I got a better laptop and never traded-up.Buy This laptop.::southieshamrock::5.0::December 30, 2011
R1BQQUOZAQD8Y5::Very Good::Very nice laptop. Sleek look and very fast. I use it for intensive programs and have not found any problems with it. My keyboard works perfectly. :)::ricosdi2000::4.0::December 12, 2011
R2SW9QHF6HPRVV::Acer Aspire Laptop::This Acer laptop, in fact the pretty much the whole Acer line, is a good solid value. This is a no-nonsense, good bang-for-your-buck machine with lots of RAM and storage (hard drive) space. It's no gaming computer but it is serving our purposes well; light photo editing, word processing, web surfing, email, etc. The wireless connection works flawlessly. It did not come loaded with a bunch of "trialware" and "crapware" that gets in your way and usually has to be uninstalled. It has a decent size screen without being too big and is good for watching DVDs.::BassCliff "BassCliff"::4.0::May 7, 2012
RHQMYW53KOPU5::Sufficiently good power at a very reasonable price::I bought this laptop as a secondary laptop for my family as I have my work and personal laptops already. Shipment arrived before promised date and packaging was done very well. I liked the glossy deep black look though it attracts a lot of lint/dust and it is not very bulky for it's size. It took me less than 30 min to light it up and was not loaded with a lot of junk software. It took some effort to install printer driver, as "Add Printer" did not give me an option to load the driver from CD so I had to do minimal install of HP printer software. I was able to connect with my TV and Home Theater Receiver using HDMI as this laptop will be used a lot for this purpose and was a main factor for buying this. It's body has a feel of plastic case and needs to be handled with a bit of caution. Multi-touch mouse pad is also not very responsive to be best in class but not a big deal for me. I am curious about WI-DI feature which I am not able to explore now but intend to at some point of time. I am not able to find any negative with laptop in 2-3 days of my ownership and quite like the screen size/display quality. I bought it at a deal price and it is totally worth it.::CallMeBond::5.0::December 31, 2011
R3R910X7QA64PO::Amazing for the price::I picked this laptop up for $400 on Amazon as a gift for my mom.  I spent a few hours setting it up for her before hand and I have to say for the price I'm really impressed.  Things could be better - namely the screen isn't very good, it gets washed out very easily, but it's not terrible.As long as you set your expectations accordingly you'll be very happy with it.  As stated, the screen isn't great, there's no backlit keyboard, and specs aren't blazing fast but that's not really something you can expect in a laptop under $500.  What it does offer that a lot of others don't is USB 3.0 (most will have only 2.0), Intel Core i3 (most will have either Pentium D or AMD) or Intel WiDi.  It's really impressive to find that in a laptop so cheap.  To really improve the problem specs (screen namely, maybe hard drive speed/size) the laptop would likely have to cost double.All in all, very pleased.  Acer bloatware was minimal and easily removed too.  I probably had it all cleaned off and installed with the software she'd need in under 2 hours.::William B. Partridge::5.0::January 7, 2012
R1T2J1J22X3U62::After 1 year I'm pretty happy::I had a couple of issues with this laptop that originally made me rate it at one star. But these problems were resolved very satisfactorily. Now, maybe, there shouldn't be any problems, but I did pay a lot less for the features and computing power of this  laptop. In any case, Acer was really excellent in handling the bigger problem (a noisy fan) which I didn't report to them until the last two weeks of the one year warranty. They fixed it, cleaned up the computer, updated the CMOS, and it works better than ever! I'm happy with it and am happy to give it 4 stars.::Bethesda Dad "Happy retiree"::4.0::December 5, 2011
R1QCTGY3OD5TJ7::Love it!::I was looking for a new laptop since my HP crapped out on me (1 1/2 old). I do a lot of video streaming and multitask a lot so I need a lot of power and ram. Also I didn't want to buy another HP. I looked for days for the perfect one at my price point. I saw this one and kept coming back to it. It's high powered, intel i3 inside, large hard drive, HDMI port, 2 usb 2.0 and 1 usb 3.0, HD web camera, lcd display (which is beautiful). Overall I am really pleased with this purchase. I've only had about 5 or 6 weeks so I'm still learning new things about it. Will update after another month or so. Anyone looking for a new laptop really should look long and hard at this one, just saying.::virginiason::5.0::August 18, 2012
R37KA9OFMNXANU::Very satisfied, good buy for the money::I have now had this laptop for over 6 months. I bought it to replace a very powerful HP desktop that dodn't allow me to have it where I wanted it.  This Acer has exceeded all of my expectations.  I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that the Intel wireless display did not work as good as I thought it should have.  This is probably due to interference frm cell phone, wireless phones, and other wireless traffic in my house.  It would loose conection frequently.  However, with the fact that the Acer has an HDMI port on it, I wired it directly to my 46" Sony Bravia (bought from Amazon) and solved my problem.  I have had absolutely no trouble with performance.  I did upgrade it, purely for my desire to improve its already great performance.  I added another 4 GB of memory and replaced the hard drive with a Seagate hybrid drive that has both Solid State and a 7200 rpm spinning drive.  Now this little screamer boots up in less than a minute and response time has nearly tripled.  If you want an affordable, easily configurable and not spned a great deal of money an Acer laptop is for you.::Turley Hayes::4.0::July 2, 2012
R1TD9YPTNYXI75::Very pleased.::Ordered this machine from Microsoft Store 10 days ago for 350 bones because my Lenovo Ideapad Y450 has died a miserable death. I was originally somewhat hesitant about purchasing an Acer since I have heard many mixed reviews, but an i3 chip, USB 3, 500 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of RAM; it was hard to pass on.My previous Lenovo had a whole book of problems including overheating (sudden shut down), awkwardly positioned headphone jack, flimsy touchpad keys, and white spots on display so these are the improvements I was looking for in addition to a decent processor, good key board, clear display, and weight. And I must say at this point, I'm very pleased with this laptop. It has been a breeze setting up, lighting fast USB 3.0, crystal clear 15.6 inch display, very thin profile, completely quiet, very little excess heat, and it came with zero bloatware (gasp)! Even after 2 and half hours of heavy computing and 120 GB of file transferring, it still had 25% of power left to spare. Granted it doesn't provide over 10 hours of battery life such as Asus U series or a Macbook, it also only cost 1/3 of those other machines and just as fast.I highly recommend this laptop.::Dynamic Six::5.0::February 28, 2012
RAN67LMCH346T::Grand daughters lap top::This was worth the money and she is enjoying it so much thank you. She is using it of course for the social media but also for school work and its working geat. The video with skype is as good or better then my 1800.00 HP again thanks for the great value.::POP "Jim"::5.0::February 13, 2012
R28S1B048IJKFT::Good deal for the money::Only using this for web browsing, e-mail, videos, etc. but I have had it for a few weeks and it works wonderfully.  Screen resolution is nice and battery holds charge for the expected timeframe.::hondadawg "CJ"::4.0::February 1, 2012
RQEDIFTP41711::good product::This is a good laptop. I purchased it because I needed a bed rest after an operation and couldn't sit and work at my desktop computer. I am basically happy with it, the mouse is easy to operate, the keyboard is good, nice speakers, it's fast, has MS Word preloaded - just what I need. I can also read books while lying in bed. I also bought a lapdesk so that computer won't overheat. Otherwise it would be very dangerous to keep computer on the bed, as it doesn't allow ventilation and the laptop can easily overheat and catch fire. Before you turn the laptop off, disconnect the lapdesk, so that it won't freeze.::christie::4.0::January 27, 2012
R15WFEHAIBO9Q4::Bang for Buck!!!::Laptop came in very good condition as described. It is super fast and worth every penny. Better is out there but for twice the price. For a laptop under $500, cant beat! I am completely 100% satisfied.::roryrudy::5.0::January 16, 2012

R3AZCJZ0VL1M6L::Laptop Computer great value::Great value, just what I need- everything for for launching home- based business combined with desktop to back it up!::Jennifer Webb::4.0::January 1, 2014
R3B6D90FO4F41W::Dream Come True::So far, this machine has everything I could have asked for in a new laptop (and I even purchased it Refurbished)...- Its performance is extremely fast, it pretty much never even gets warm--let alone overheats. It handles multiple demanding applications at once without a problem (e.g. running Photoshop while watching a movie and browsing Firefox with numerous tabs open...- The  built in sound system is much louder and better quality than most other laptops I have heard.- The touchpad (and I hate touchpads) I think is the best I've ever used.- The fan is not only super effective at keeping the CPU cool, but its also the quietest fan I've ever encountered. And I mean absurdly quiet. This is really a stand-out feature of the laptop.- BATTERY LIFE:I don't know what the other guy who reviewer is talking about--my machine has excellent battery life! Maybe he just happened to get the one in 1000 with a faulty battery. In fact, among the surprisingly useful pre-installed "bloatware" programs that every computer company ships their laptops with, there is a "battery life extender" function which gives you the option to only allow the battery to charge to 80% of its capacity, which actually preserves the life of the battery in the long run--an excellent feature for people like me who will be using A/C power most of the time anyway.- The keyboard is just plain sexy. It looks sexy and it feels sexy. Every key is perfectly spaced, it knows exactly which key my finger is aiming for and the "chiclet" or "island style" design makes the computer look so stylish that even mac users will question their choices.- The screen is absolutely brilliant. It has the perfect balance of brightness and reflection/glare from various lighting situations and the glass stretches smoothly from edge to edge (not resting behind some clunky plastic frame like most other laptops.MINOR COMPLAINTS:- The model advertises a 14 inch screen size, but while most companies measure screen diagonally from one outside corner of the lid to the other, the 14 inch screen that Samsung advertises is only counting the diagonal measurement of the actual display area. If you include the black framing around the display area and measure diagonally from the outside corners of the lid, then it is actually 16 inches exactly. Fortunately for me, this wasn't a major selling point and its pretty much the same size as my last laptop, so it fits perfectly into my old case.- There is no quick-and-easy on/off switch for the touchpad, so when I plug in my USB mouse, I have to go to the mouse settings and disable the touchpad since I find that it (or any laptop's touchpad) can get in the way of typing.- Also, it'd be nice to find a laptop sporting an onboard 5.1 soundcard. I mean its nearly 2012 for crying out loud. That seems like a reasonable request, but I haven't seen any laptop that can hook up a 5.1 sound system without an external converter.Anyhow, so far I am extremely happy with my purchase. I did a great deal of research and read/watched every review I could find for this model before finally buying it. It has met all my expectations, save for the minor 14 inch size misunderstanding that is. I highly recommend this product.::J. Cristobal::5.0::November 15, 2011
R1S985OBDLZRSD::Best laptop period.::I waited and did research for this laptop for 3 months and bought it actually at Best Buy as soon as it came out.Ive been using this laptop for about half an year now and this is one has been just amazing. I decided to write a review because of the poor rating on this product because of the review below on the defective item apparently. I will tell you why I decided to go for this laptop than any others after doing research for months.PROS= GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!! For the specs that is better than macbook pro, its almost the half price! Need to say more? i5 processor. 6GB ram. 750GB storage.= There are way too many pros but first thing you can notice right away is the GREAT DESIGN. Well spread out and designed island style keyboard. Big None-button mousepad also adds to the design. The surface doesn't leave finger marks. And yes, it looks like macbook pro but who cares it looks great and I am a consumer.= One of the main reasons why this one stood out more than any other laptops as I was originally going to purchase Asus laptop was because of the MULTI-FINGER GESTURE MOUSEPAD just like the one on macbook pro. It has up to FOUR FINGER GESTURE which is VERY VERY VERY useful. Very Very easy to switch between windows. You have to try it to understand.= Easy customization access. It is very easy to change volume or change the display brightness on this laptop which I have found them very useful while using this laptop.= Battery life is great! I usually get one full day of use on battery on low light. Depends on how heavy you use it but I think usually lasts about good 8 hours.= Super fast. Turns on any heavy program in seconds. Very fast boot time. I am too lazy to explain all.= Very quiet. The noise on this laptop is non-existent.= Display. It's samsung. Enough said.CONS - these are not major but the things that would've been nice.= No backlit keyboard. This is not a problem at all but it definitely would have been nice if had one. but it was not an issue for me upon purchasing and still not a problem.= CD DRIVE. It's the classic PC CD drive on laptop where it pops out and you have to put the CD. I prefer like the one on macbook where you insert in the CD.I had $1000 HP Pavilion laptop before this one which lasted me only 3 years. It had problems in every way: horrible battery life, terrible display, overheating, SUPER LOUD NOISE, keyboard, etc..... literally in every way!I learned my lesson and did a careful research for months and I am more than satisfied with this item. DO NOT write reviews on defective items. It has been half an year and still this laptop is the best laptop out there. Get this laptop and won't regret it.That's it, get this laptop if you are looking for a laptop.PS. if you want a laptop with the cons above (backlit keyboard and the inserting type CD drive), check out Samsung Series 7 Chronos 14 inch.::Shin Kim::5.0::December 5, 2011
R13WC60CWYX30R::Great laptop especially for the price::This is most likely the best laptop I've had to date for the price. I have had all sorts of laptops including the 13in Macbook pro 15in Macbook pro, Asus N53SV, Toshiba satelite, Hp pavillion. This laptop has two things that I wanted for a laptop. Great battery life and decent graphics (Nvidia 525m). The other choice available was the Asus u46 laptop with 8+ battery and 540m graphics. This Samsung laptop however beats it out in a couple of different categories. The screen, keyboard, and audio is better. If only this laptop had a Macbook pro screen (more quality, it is a edge to edge glass screen) and a backlit keyboard then this laptop would easily be the best laptop for under $1000. This laptop easily gets 8+ hours on 80% of battery.Pros:Long battery life (8+ on 80%)Decent graphics (can be overclocked to a 550m)Decent Screen (Edge to edge glass)Decent Audio for a laptopTouchpad (get the synaptics drivers, not at the macbook pro level but one of the best windows touchpads I tried)750gb hard drivei5 processorPrice ( I paid $599 at Tigerdirect, compare that to $1200 macbook pro with no dedicated graphics processor)Never heats up unless your playing games (My macbooks used to become way too hot and that's 2011 model).Keyboard (nice typing experience but not backlit, a little less quality then macbook pro)Cons:No cons just a couple of things that would make it better like macbook pro like screen and backlit keyboard would make this a great laptop. I would have even paid $800 for a laptop like that.::Zheka::5.0::March 2, 2012
R2AD13WA9MLK0S::Sorry but it sucks after a year::This laptop is wonderful at first. About 8-13 months later your doomed. You montior will go out and the laptop is made with a defective chipset that was recalled by Intel, but Samsung still sells the laptop. You can google Samsung NP-QX411-W01US monitor issues and find so many utube videos and articles about the monitor. With thinner laptops available these days its better to buy something else. When this laptop came out it was a very good one buy the hardware details and it will play hardcore video games but it wont last long enough to get your money worth and the manufacture warranty will not cover any thing. If I would have paid less than $500 maybe I would feel like 1 year is not bad but I recieved it as a gift years ago and the price was well over $1000 bucks. It was way before its time but the screen didnt last over its time. I'm sorry but I probably will not buy or even take as a gift another Samsung laptop. Its beautiful but its insides are worthless. Now I have to buy another monitor to replace the defective screen but with the chipset being an issue I'm sure the motherboard will burn out right after I replace the monitor. At this point I hate to say it but its boardline Dell quality and Dell sucks.::wentAmazonCrazy::1.0::January 14, 2014
R34L0MRW574X6Q::A letdown after three-years (Updated)::Update: After writing the review below, I switched my battery setting back to accepting a full, rather than 80% charge. I set the pc at 80% charge after several freezes and crashes, and based on a start-up recommendation one day that the OS provided. After a several weeks of this 80% setting, its extremely erratic and nonsensical power-remaining statuses, and many more crashes, the freezes and crashes are largely gone now that I'm back to it taking full charges (although they were present at this setting months back). Much better off now as OS stability goes. Still have the monitor problem with its silly "fix". Still two-stars.- - - -I bought this laptop new from Best Buy with a quick-decision process based on my previous laptop being unsuited for further travel.It has a wonderful exterior with an aluminum finish all-around and a nice tactile full-size (or near that) keyboard. It's memory capabilities are well beyond my day-to-day needs, or at least they should be if not malfunctioning.Off the shelf, everything was great except the touchpad, which is a giant pain-in-the-rear without going into your preferred settings in great detail. I admittedly took too long to finally go into this detail to get the spastic touchpad under some control, and if applicable I highly suggest readers take this time -- it is well worth the investment despite Samsung and Synaptics insane default settings and rocket science touchpad.All was good until recently and admittedly after traveling:- The monitor begun cutting out in 2 of 3 vertical sections, a problem other users have had based on tips online. This can be "fixed" by inserting paper inside the monitor assembly. While it works, it obviously puts pressure where there once was little or no pressure. Not comfortable with the fix, but it works and it doesn't cost a zillion dollars to have some techies go on a we-don't-know-but-will-charge-you-anyway quest.- There's some sort of hardware and/or software problem(s) causing frequent freezing, crashing, and shutdowns. I've uninstalled and reinstalled various programs, and ensured all Windows 7 software is up to date, with little noticeable improvement in its stability.- The battery seems to be going haywire, and whether or not this is tied to the previous bullet is unknown.Back to my recent travels, I cared for this laptop carefully as usual while moving about, and I don't remember any drops, bangs, or incidents that would have caused damage. And I firmly don't believe an unknown incident could logically lead to all the problems above.I really wanted to (and want to) use this laptop for a long long time, for travel and primarily photo work. But after only three years, it looks like it's regrettably become a stay-at-home freezing & crashing machine.Big letdown, and I'll be more wary of Samsung purchases in the future.::Matthew::2.0::December 20, 2013
RLMFOP34CQIBL::Samsung qx411::After extensive research i have concluded that this laptop is the best within my range. It offers amazing battery life along with exceptional graphics from the Nvidia Geforce drivers. it allows me to play games on the my laptop that me desktop couldn't even handle. combined with the i5 processor and 750Gb of storage its a lethal competitor to laptops everywhere. Recently my sister began looking for a laptop as well and after her research she also settled with the Samsung.It also contains many small features that are easily overlooked such as...Brushed Aluminum(no more fingerprints or scuffs from cheap plastic covers)2 usb 3.0 ports (a must have for newer laptops)spread out keyboard ( no more double pressing keys or junk getting caught for months between the cracks)Quietfan and less heating (even while running bf3 the fan was subtle and unnoticeable)good speakers for a simple laptop (headphones are optional)great battery life( easily 8 hours for simple browsing)no cons, but if it where to be made better...put in a backlit keyboardmaybe some bluetooth or blue-raygorilla glassOverall the best buy for the amazing features. i got mine for 670 with shipping from tiger direct.::KKhirfan::5.0::July 3, 2012
R2LL4R20W6RC1T::Best laptop I ever owned::This is the most well built laptop I have seen in a PC. Only Mac can top this, and I dare say a Mac is even with this, not better. The aluminum brushed finish is perfect. Finally, a laptop that feels like you got what you paid for!Incredible price for a 1TB system, and the screen is amazing. My only beef is the lack of keyboard illumination. If the keyboard lit up this would be flawless.::David E. Mann::5.0::May 25, 2012
RE3KD241D2VKA::Best Laptop Ever::This laptop is a BEAST. First of all, for my fellow gamers out there, let me say that this thing has pretty much got you covered. It runs Skyrim on high settings, silky smooth. It runs Magicka fine. It runs pretty much everything. Even The Witcher 2, although on medium. Oh, and you know how Minecraft, simple game as it is, can be picky with which computers it runs well on, regardless of specs? Well it runs AMAZINGLY well on this, even if you're hosting a sever at the same time.Everything is snappy and fast. HD 720p-1080p video on youtube or playing in VLC is lag-free and gorgeous. You can even have quite a few other things open at the same time, alt-tab to your heart's content, and it's totally fine--no freezes or hiccups.The touchpad is the biggest I've ever seen on a windows laptop and it feels great, although I rarely use it myself, preferring a wireless mouse. The keyboard feels absolutely AMAZING. I do a lot of writing and this laptop is a joy to type on, provided you have some wrist support (or if you don't rest your wrists on anything like you're "supposed" to do.)Besides the crap software it comes installed with, as does every PC (screw you Norton!), the only negatives I can think of are that the battery is internal, and thus can't be removed. I've unplugged laptops and taken out the battery before to get them to turn off when they freeze up really bad and holding the power button doesn't do anything, so I can see this causing a really bad day for a few people, but it's not a huge deal, in my opinion.::David::5.0::May 2, 2012
R1ZUKZWK4HT9BA::Listed Hard Drive 750 GB but NOT::Nice looking computer and runs fine but Not as listed for the Hard Drive is small. 260GB he did not mention. ???But I will keep it and use it just as is.  Thanks for the nice Unit with the GeForce.  John H::santanas::3.0::January 30, 2014
R2IAM3X07ASDFA::I was expecting more from Samsung::Pros:1) Good value2) Relatively attractive appearance3) Fast performance - I bought this to handle somewhat complex functions in excel, and it has performed very well4) Reasonable battery life - about 4 hrs from my experienceCons - to be honest, I probably wouldn't be writing this review right now if not for these disappointments:1) First one I bought had a broken sound card or something (the sound was making a terrible sound and would not stop).  Samsung replaced it pretty promptly, but still...2) I've owned it for just one year, and the keyboard has started to malfunction.  One day the "e" and "v" buttons will stop working, the next they'll be fine and the "t" won't work, etc.  Samsung has no updates to fix this.3) Poor responsiveness / placement of the trackpad.  The trackpad will often click in strange places while I'm typing (because your hands have to naturally rest on the pad while you're typing).  Additionally, the scroll function of the keyboard is very unreliable.Overall, the processor and things having to do with actual performance have been great, but the peripheral functions have obviously been lacking::bogles::2.0::December 11, 2013
R1HYXTCM8DQ22N::Samsung QX Laptop::I've had this laptop for about 3 weeks now and I love it!  I ordered this laptop for college because I was recommended to get a PC.  Originally I was leaning towards a Macbook Pro but the price just seemed a little outrageous.  This laptop could easily be a "PC version" of the Macbook.  14 inches is the perfect size and it is thin, light, and sleek with the all silver look.  Laptop is fast and easy to set up and use.  I would definitely recommend this product if you're looking for a PC laptop!::EMarie::5.0::July 31, 2012
R1ILLE19RBQH6N::Excellent machine, few flaws::Pros:i5 2.3 GHz6GB DDR3 RAMDecent graphics card700 GB HDDPretty fast computer with tons of storage.  Graphics card could be a bit better but anything with a 1 or 2 GB video memory is going to cost a lot more than $700.Very slim, aluminium case.  Keys are nice because they are like Mac keys, things cant get stuck under them.  Not backlit but who cares.  Extremely quiet, almost seems like there isn't even a fan in here.Seems to have awesome battery life so far.Cons:Comes with a bit of bloatware, as most new computers do.  I just uninstalled all of it including Norton SS.  Most of that stuff you don't need.  There were a couple cool things I hadn't heard of before though, like the snipping tool- not sure if that's part of win7 or not but i've never seen it before.  Some of the Samsung apps on here aren't half bad either.Crashed when I installed steam- reinstalled and it seems to work fine now. No driver issues or anything.Lastly the screen..  No one seems to have posted what the max resolution is- it's 1366 x 768.  The screen itself is small, but it's a nice compromise if you're looking for portability.  When I play games on this, i'm going to HDMI it to my TV- when i take it to school, i wont be hauling around a 200 lb 5' x 4' laptop anymore.So really, there aren't many cons.  The bloatware can be easily uninstalled, the crash i had was probably just a random stupid issue, and the screen is small- but if it suits your needs for portability, then it's fine.hope this helps.::Mike Michaelson::5.0::June 26, 2012
R3CVNO7QP4KDX9::Best laptop ever::I have owned many different laptops form many different manufacuters. This Samsung QX-411 is the best I have ever used. It is very fast. Battery life is exceptional. I consistantly get 6 hours from the battery. I find it to be rock solid. The keyboard is a dream to type on. I would recommend this machine to anyone.::PapaB::5.0::December 6, 2011
R18UQDKEGTOLAR::poor quality, stay away::I have bought Samsung NP-QX411-W01US last summer. The hard drive was broken in a month. I have to spend money to ship it to TX to have it serviced. Now right after a year the screen stops working correctly. There are 3 bands on the screen with the center band completely white and the right band completely dark. From the link below you can see that this is a systematic problem that happened to a lot of users. Because it is just passed one year warranty period I have to deal with this on my own. I regret to have bought this trouble. My advice: Stay away from this and all of Samsung's products.[...]::Anunhappyuser::1.0::November 22, 2012
R2UV4D81O65OG8::Cheaply Made::This computer is cheaply made.  The mouse pad is horrible and frustrating to use.  A separate mouse is required. The keyboard is also horrible.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this computer!!::Squirt::2.0::May 30, 2012
R3UCBYNBG67NFW::Poor quality, do not purchase this product::This notebook has a nice appearance, but don't be fooled. If you plan to take your laptop on the road or use it with an external monitor, do not buy this product. The battery dies after 45 minutes of use after being fully charged; Samsung's claim of 9-hour battery life is completely bogus. I have tried a full discharge/recharge several times as suggested by Samsung customer service, but the problem persists.  The pre-loaded software is also buggy, particularly Samsung Display Manager and Samsung Recovery Solution.  Samsung customer service is also a big disappointment - technicians are not knowledgeable, and asked me to rebuild my system numerous times only to find that problems were not solved after hours of work.  My only option now is to ship the unit to Samsung for warranty service, leaving us without a computer for 2-3 weeks at a minimum, as Samsung does not provide a loaner computer during the service period.  Extremely disappointed - I will not purchase another Samsung product, ever.::Lisa J::1.0::November 1, 2011
R3AY9ON8W06IR6::Did not believed bad reviews and got mine...LOVE IT!!!::I'm a professional photographer and I was looking for a laptop with a big good screen for photo & video retouching. I've read bad reviews but considered them inappropriate. I've left a comment there. It's just been a bad copy which happens no doubt or might been a virus. This laptop is fast, has amazing full HD screen, a very good sound to watch movies (if you enable a Dolby function). Very comfortable. Internet button is awesome, opens your home page in a half second. Matte finish and anti blink screen are amazing. Overall it worth the money 100%. Would definitely recommend it for purchase.::Starikov::5.0::February 21, 2012
RYOCCJQOMGDL9::Excellent::I could not be happier with my purchase of the Sony Vaio. I do have to say it is pretty big, but that is something I can live with when I am watching a Blu-ray and it is super crisp. It is a beast though when streaming videos and downloading multiple applications. Excellent computer!::tampachief::4.0::February 27, 2012
RVZ0XXJ4IQSR3::Great Rig w/a Slight Reservation::I've had the Vaio for more than a month now, so the "Oh boy, a new computer!" thing has worn off and I know it's strengths and weaknesses.  It works fine.  It's excellent: fast, plenty of power for anything I want to run, and as many things as I want to run, even with Norton droning away in the background sucking up system resources.  The keyboard layout is fine and the action is fast and light.  If you're a fast typist, you'll like it.The screen is the only problem I've had.  It looks great on the windows-supplied images such as wallpapers.  But when I watch some movies, stream TV programs or visit some websites, it looks like crap (blindingly bright, greenish tinge, blues and reds over-saturated).  Then other movies, streamed content and web pages look wonderful.  Like HD even when the content isn't HD.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to what's going to look good and what isn't.  I finally gave up trying to calibrate the screen, restored it to the factory setting and got used to it.  Now I hardly notice it.It's a physically heavy rig.  I wouldn't buy this thing to lug around unless you've got your own personal roadie.  Think of this one as a desktop replacement, which is what I think Sony intended it to beNote: if you're having trouble with the cursor and the trackpad, adjust it.  You can use it just like your smartphone, but I found the cursor got easily confused and moved unpredictably with all that on.  So I shut off all the two-finger operations, in fact, I shut off everything that wasn't strictly move and tap.  I also adjusted the sensitivity so it doesn't have such a hair-trigger.  Now it works fine.Overall, a great computer, once you get used to the screen thing.::SpiralXSea::4.0::February 11, 2012
R3E7C9I84OWI2A::Exactly What I Needed - Powerful for the Price::This is a powerful machine for the price. Equivalent systems run quite a bit higher on cost. This beast of a desktop replacement is not a sleek, stylish machine. It is, however, well designed, comfortable to use, and built for power and performance -- which is exactly what I need. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it's lighter than it looks and won't be too burdensome to travel with when necessary.Functionality: I wanted something that could handle working in 3D environments, building and hosting open sim virtual worlds, and filming machinima -- in addition to producing artifacts for digital and media arts. The visual display is beautiful. 3D virtual worlds look stunning with this and it handles high graphics settings at blazing speed, with excellent resolution. This Vaio F2 Series runs silently, except when running high performance graphics programs -- the fan kicks in at that point, and it heats up a bit.The keyboard is comfortable. I like the back lighting. The Vaio comes loaded with a number of programs and preconfigured settings. I upgraded to Windows 7 Professional and deleted programs that I won't be using. I also reconfigured quite a few things to suit my needs. Beware of Vaio Care -- they seem to be giving themselves permission to latch into your system, access your files, and monitor everything you do. I don't trust my data in the hands of random harvesters. I declined the offer.Update: I had to downgrade from 5 stars to 4 due to power failures. Three times now the computer has turned itself off while performing simple functions in basic programs. Each time, electricity was on with all power cords connected and live. The laptop resumed normally when I powered it back up. The good news is that I didn't lose any work in progress. However, this makes me worry that someday I might.::Oteaatea "Nick"::4.0::July 21, 2012
R85FSBGBVRL8W::One of the best laptops I`ve ever used::This laptop computer definitely worth its value. It has a super core i7 processor with 6 gigs (I myself am going to upgrade it to 8 gigs).

R182JZGGWVGD7S::Sony laptop failed after 2 months::I received the laptop Nov. 5, 2011. Today is January 24, 2012. A few weeks after having it, I was filling out an online application and a message popped up saying 'Your CNTL key is pressed'.. it wasn't. Anything I typed, wouldn't type and it kept opening a new window on the browser I was on. I researched this problem and found nothing. This happened off and on when I'd be on any browser. I had to continually shut down and reboot the machine. Two days ago, it happened again. I shut it down, and it wouldn't reboot properly. I went into safemode and ran every test from the laptop menus and also from the Sony website. Nothing worked. I finally got a black screen saying 'No Operating System available'. I called Sony and they are sending me a recovery disk for ONLY $70!! This should be FREE since it's still under a 90 day warranty. If this disk doesn't work and the hard drive ends up failing, they said they'll send out a Sony technician to my house (so not to inconvenience me) which will take 5-10 days. I probably won't buy another Sony laptop.I called Sony on Thursday, since I didn't receive my Recovery disks(3) by Wednesday and they said the order hadn't shipped yet and the new person shipped a new set overnight. I asked at what point do I just get a new laptop. She said to call Amazon. I did. Amazon informed me since my laptop arrived on Nov 5-11, I was inside a special return window for Christmas and I had until January 31 to get a brand new one overnighted to me. I made the call to Amazon on Friday, January 27. Got it today, Jan-28 before 10:00 am. I went ahead and tried the recovery disks on the original laptop and they didn't work anyway, so I wasted $70 with Sony. If this one fails, I won't buy another Sony laptop.. but I do recommend Amazon. I loved them before, but now think they are awesome for being so quick to solve my problem.::just4mah::2.0::January 24, 2012
R1YWAZ1LKOQ0PV::I hate giving this Sony a low rating, but...::...this Sony was such a disappointment.  I bought it with high hopes and a high recommendation from the Best Buy salesperson. He compared it with the top-of-the-line Mac. It has a lot of good features, but is highly flawed.  The touch pad is overly-sensitive.  I could barely type on it without the screen resizing every few minutes. The adapter is very loose in the slot.  So loose that it has fallen out of the unit several times. The volume button started to fail and would work inconsistently.  While watching a YouTube movie, the screen started distorting. It became colorfully-staticky for several minutes.  I thought it was an isolated incident, but it happened many times afterwards.  Often times when I would scroll down on an Internet page and then scroll back up, the whole page would become highlighted and it was very difficult to remove.  Also, without warning, while typing, the whole keyboard would lose its typing ability. Every key I hit opened up some random window.  I used to turn it off and reboot until I discovered that hitting the CTRL key would solve the problem.  It happened because the CTRL button periodically got stuck.  Additionally, when more than 5 windows are open in Google Chrome, the last tab overlaps the minimize button in the upper right hand corner, and you can't get to it without closing that last tab.  Finally you almost have to be a weight-lifter to lift this laptop.  Can't imagine why Sony made it so heavy.  The adapter was twice as heavy as a normal adapter that comes with most laptops. Very awkward to transport.  I wouldn't exactly call it portable-friendly.Two good things about the Sony are the screen clarity and lit keyboard.  Because of the outstanding reputation that Sony has for high-quality laptops, I was surprised at all of the imperfections.  I thought this would be a computer that would keep me happy for at least 6-7 years, but the outcome was disastrous. So on the last eligible day, I took it back to Best Buy and traded it for a Toshiba Satellite P775-S7320.  It was $350 less, and works like a charm.  Couldn't be happier with my new Toshiba!  Bottom line, I would not recommend this particular Sony Vaio laptop.  If you purchase one, be sure to first find out the return policy.::Just My Opinion::2.0::January 28, 2012
R34SYT069B8L5C::Too much!::Great product, but it's too heavy and too big. It's more like a Desktop, not a Laptop.Sony Vaio computers are awesome, but this one doesn't look like a notebook, beacause of its enormous weight.They should only improve this.::Taline Barros::4.0::June 11, 2012
R3COI2D7O1EWDT::Absolute Junk!::Buyer BEWARE!!!!!!!  I built an F-series from the Sony website in part due to the wonderful reviews I read here on Amazon. Additionally, we've owned Sony's for decades. As a pro photographer, I wanted a big screen and fast processor and didn't want to spend 2k upgrading to 'the other guys'.  I purchased this laptop in March, it arrived in 10 days.  Within 2 weeks I was getting the blue screen of death with a Driver_IRQL_not_less_or_equal error.  I called Sony, they told me I had a virus, I needed to reformat.  I didn't believe them, I run excellent anti-virus software haven't had a virus in a decade, but I reformatted anyway.  While reinstalling ALL software and updates, it started happening again.  I called back, they said maybe I had a bad hard drive and/or RAM stick, they would send a tech out to help fix it.  Several days later, a tech arrived, with new hard drive and RAM stick.  While reinstalling all updates and software AGAIN, I started having unexpected shutdowns.  No blue screen, just hard shutdowns like someone was holding down the power button.  Blip, my work would be gone.  I would restart and it would happen over and over again.  3 Event ID numbers later, HOURS and HOURS on the phone with support, I have now shipped my Sony VAIO back to Sony - with a promise of 7 to 10 day turn around time.  Received a message this morning from the Tech, "Can't find anything wrong, its working fine, call at your earliest convienence."  So, I called, an hour and half later, they want to 'escalate' my issue to 'engineering'....which means I have to wait another 3 days while they sort out their issue and call me back.  They also informed me it would be an additional 7 to 10 days.  I've had this laptop for 3 months, spent 1,500.00 on it, and have been without it working since the day it arrived on my doorstep.  Have repeatedly asked for my money back and thus far, they are unwilling to give it to me.  I'm beyond livid, beyond frustrated, and am ready to swear of Sony products for life.  Worst customer service experience EVER.  Literally.  On my son's 3rd birthday, I've now spent 2 hours dealing with this poor excuse for a company.  Electronic issues can happen with ANY company, but the service you receive there after is what its all about to me.  Sitting on hold, talking to a dozen different people about the exact same issue, not HAVING my laptop, just ick..... so you've been warned.::A. King::1.0::June 1, 2012
R3I8IK4SNUOY0L::Solid, fast, lightweight.::This machine has a solid, all metal construction, with the only plastic being the keys and the bezel surrounding the screen. It is quite fast with a 2nd gen core i CPU and an AMD 6630 GPU.  Keyboard is one of the best I've ever used, and easy match for any thinkpad, and backlit to boot.  The 1600x900 matte screen is bright and very clear, but lacks color depth and contrast for any kind of high quality, color accurate display.Other reviews have referred to it as flimsy but honestly, this is a pretty solidly built machine.  Pressure on the back of the lid produces no distortions in the display, the base is very very stiff, especially for such a thin machine.  Overall this machine reminds me of the T4x series thinkpad I used to own, but with a much brighter screen.The speakers are terrible, even for a small 13" machine.Linux compatibility has some issues that will hopefully get ironed out.  Nothing that makes using it unusable, but a few things like the trackpad not having any suitable drivers, and really poor battery life (under linux) that make it a questionable choice if Linux on the go is your primary reason for using this machine.::Gordon S. Marlowe::4.0::November 18, 2011
R3OE9ZGQLM87JQ::Not one issue::I have used my laptop for a few days now and put it through some different trials.  I tried videos, no problems, the only thing I wish could of been a little better was the sound of the speakers, but that's just the style of the laptop, it's hard to concentrate on both light and slim and at the same time have insanely large speakers.  Next I inserted a few CD's including a movie which played perfectly and very clear, again the speakers are loud enough, just a little high pitched.  You can always plug in a set of aux speakers if you wish.  I installed a couple simple action games to make sure they would load and play and again no problem.  I miss the old Sony power switch on the end of hinge, now it's like most other laptops positioned directly above the number keys.  One more adjustment I had to make was getting used to a dedicated dvd eject button above the number keys again.  You can't just push in on the dvd play door any more.  Not a big deal and once I get use to it I'll be fine.  I really like the 1600 resolution option on this particular model, if your wondering about text size, my philosophy is that you can always turn up the zoom of the page to 125% and most web pages still fit on the screen.  The keyboard is nicely backlit and the keys have enough space between them so you don't hit two at once.  I only wish with the new hinge setup that it didn't have that plat in the rear of the laptop, it's centered and runs better than half way across and sticks out a bout an 1/8".  Not a big deal, but again, I liked the old style Sony hinge better personally.  The new hinge cover is finished nicely though, looks like brushed metal.  All of the input/output connections, except for the dvd player are on the right side of the laptop, I prefer this because it's easier for me to remember what side it's one.  There are 3 indicator lights in the front left and look nice.  There is a cap key light above the numbers.  The laptop feels well made to me and I have no regrets.::Mark J. Tierney "coastie 1980"::5.0::December 27, 2011
R36012JSHF1K8O::quality machine::I looked at all similar units in the 800 to 1200 price range, and chose this one for the keyboard ease, backlight, and robust construction. It is substantially made, mostly of aluminum/magnesium alloy, and the matte display is outstanding. Other units had the gloss and the glare is quite distracting. You pay a bit more for the Sony name, but it is worth it. It has the usual bloatware, but not overly intrusive, and one can disable these pesky bits easily. It is remarkably light, yet not flimsy in the slightest. I'm using it in my surgical office for electronic records, CT scan image review and other fairly processor intense tasks and the i5 handles all quite rapidly. I did up the RAM to 8mb, and that was $14 well spent! Got mine from 42nd street photo in NYC, and all is well. I would recommend it highly.::RomansRoad::5.0::January 11, 2012
R15247N574AT0V::Thin, light, speedy little notebook::Purchased this laptop because its basically the only machine out there with the combination of features I wanted, and it costs less than a grand to boot.-Backlit keyboard - very difficult to find in this size, much more effective than the little thinklight on Thinkpads-Hi resolution 1600x900 screen - just try find this feature outside of Dell enterprise workstation models-USB 3.0 onboard-Fingerprint reader-Dedicated Radeon graphics - seems like nearly every PC is using the crappy Intel HD integraded chips in their 13.3" and smaller models-Aluminum unibody - I'm really confused by the reviews describing this laptop as "flimsy" or claims that its not actually metalHave been using the machine for about a week now and its simply impressing me at every turn. After uninstalling the bulk of the Sony bloatware, Ive got it setup quite cleanly rather than doing a full clean windows install (as mentioned by another reviewer who was having difficulty).Runs every game I've thrown at it in native resolution (1600x900) so far, including BF3 and MW3, which is jawdropping. Having a portable gaming system thats this svelte is going to make traveling a heck of a lot more enjoyable. It quite simply blows the doors off my last "thin and light" acer timeline.All in all, a good purchase and a happy camper.

R1YBLDFFVYLLBZ::Some Issues At first But taken Care of later::I own the SC version of this rig, which i got from best buy at the time this model launched, the price drop has been amazing and am considering getting this one just for the improved graphics and higher resolution, for those who are in doubt ive had mine since june and apart from a bit of fan noise and Some HD issue were the Laptop wouldnt detect it, it worked fine, these issues have all been taking care of with bios upgrades, one thing we lost is SATA 3 compatibility as they removed it from the bios, i expect this to return soon enough in future updates, i use mine for work, watch blu rays and occasionally game on it, even though mine has an inferior Video Card to this model, right now im thinking o buying the SA3 and giving my SC to the wife, or maybe ill wait for a more updated one with the new Radeon Mobility chips. Overall a great lappy in this form factor, and i liked mine so much im thinking bout upgrading it to the next submodel!!!::Francisco Ortiz::4.0::January 2, 2012
R2AERZZ33NM7YL::Fan is too loud::This laptop was a disappointment for me. I bought it more than a year ago, seemed like quite good but now I'm about to smash it into pieces because I can't stand the fan noise anymore. The fan keeps working even there is nothing bothering CPU. I've tried to update the BIOS firmware but it didn't work. I think the reason is it's manufactured with a design problem. When you open the lid, it just covers the fan air exit.As a result, I don't recommend anyone to buy this laptop.::Fatih Irmak::2.0::September 30, 2013
R18TPQXSCGJ2A9::Laptop::I purchased this about one yr ago and it is still perfect condition and working great.But fan sound is quite noise though.::Kyaw::4.0::May 24, 2013
R23VTFF9OT99SB::Disappointed::I will make this quick. Having owned and had success with previous Sony computer products, I was excited about getting another Sony product. For the last several years I have been using an IBM Thin Pad, a great machine. Knowing I had luck in the past with Sony, I felt my decision to move away from the IBM to Sony was a good one, unfortunatly for me it was not.I bought my new Sony about a year ago online. I customized it for my uses but the base system had Windows 7 and and Intel Core i5. From day one this computer took forever to start up and it has only gotten worse. It now takes my laptop 10-15 minutes fron a cold start to be ready for use, even then many programs stall to start, it is very frustrating. Once startd I still find it difficult to multi-task with more then 4 programs. Switching between Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint causes major hick ups as I tan through each program. This is my biggest complaint.The other issue is the fan noise, its very loud. I saw this in previous reviews but decided it couldn't be that bad, wrong.They only saving grace, and the only reason I gave two stars instead of 1, is the battery life. I opted for the sheet battery which gives me plenty of juice on cross-continental flights, that is nice.Overall I am disappointed with the laptop and will most likly never go back to Sony computing again, back to IBM.::rawbert::2.0::September 12, 2012
RROEOL0MZODCP::Love it, except...::Amazing laptop, but the trackpad keeps freezing... It is a known issue, and nobody knows how to fix it!!! Arggggg!!!  Alot of time I am unable to move to the left... I usually have to restart to reset the trackpad!  Very frustrating!::Pamela::4.0::January 16, 2013
R3BC2VG9E9ONBW::Sony VAIO EJ2 Series VPCEJ28FX/B 17.3-Inch Laptop::It is very fast machine.  Great screen and keyboard. I added 4G of RAM (total 8G). With such addition most of the applications open immediately. 650G hard drive is OK for laptop. However, most of new laptops have 750G hard disk, at least. I would rate it 5 stars, but it has really bad-bad sound.::Igor Entin::4.0::October 14, 2012
R2CVHTRKNODTJH::Sony laptop::Outstanding laptop, absolutely not problems and the on line backup from Sony has been very good. I am taking online classes and the larger screen is very nice. On the down side this is a heavy computer and carring it for any length of time can be tireing. I also had to buy a different case as my pervious laptop was much smaller.::Gary of Burchard::5.0::September 20, 2012
R33NLLTOD99JGN::A few hiccups but otherwise great.::I really like this little (well I suppose "big") laptop. It doesn't feel huge because it's so light but the screen size is amazing for the price. I play light games on it and it runs them perfectly. I'm also a digital artist and it runs photoshop, corel painter, etc. with no lag and no fuss. Only issue I have with it is that the screen is not good for drawing; the color difference from the top of the screen to the bottom is dramatically different even at a straight on angle of view. This sort of comes with the territory of the screens on laptops anyway but my old Toshiba with the smaller screen had a less dramatic difference.Even so, it's a fast computer. I added the extra bar of memory but I probably wouldn't have even needed it.I did have one issue where the finger pad started jumping around a bit. I found this troubling from a brand new computer but the problem went away when I rebooted and hasn't appeared since. I rarely use the touch pad anyway, so I, personally, didn't find it as a huge red flag.::Ekapa::4.0::April 1, 2012
R1L9WABXRAETYW::Great laptop!::I got this laptop today and I am enjoying it so far! Blu-rays plays great but problem is that every time I eject the button from the computer, the Blu-Ray drive does not go out all the way so I have to pull it and also push it but otherwise, great laptop! Does anybody else have that problem?::John Lindsey::5.0::February 3, 2012
R21IR7NMOD3989::Sony Vaio EJ2::Great laptop for what it is at a great price. Very fast, will be even faster when I add 4gig more ram. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a mid range laptop. Works perfectly.::Mikeman::5.0::December 30, 2011
R240XTXKAZUYG7::Laptop::I love the size of the keyboard and screen.  It is very light weight and works great.  Having a number key pad is also very beneficial to me.  The screen quality it top notch.::dj::5.0::December 26, 2011
RDXIOZ974E4MI::Battery Life Sucks::The laptop is nice.  Seems to move pretty good.  However, the battery life keeps draining in less than an hour.  We charged it completely then used it until it died.  The first time it died it lasted almost 3 hours.  Then we let it charge fully before using it again but it still only lasted about 2.5 hours.  I contacted the seller now they told me to contact Sony.  If I do not get this resolved it will be going back.  It has been less that a month & the battery stays charged less than an hour.  It doesn't matter what I do on it.  I could unplug it & leave it sit off & when I turn it back on it is down on battery by about 1/8.  Something definitely wrong.::roseheart::3.0::January 20, 2012

ROZ5IDC9C0N0C::Horrible::This computer was extremely slow since the first time we turned it on. I even got the extra 2GB of RAM, like most people suggested. It constantly crashes, the case just seems like it is made as inexpensive as possible.

RG4A1577628TF::Great laptop as a desktop replacement.::I have almost two years using this computer and I'm very happy because it never fails me. I work with Photoshop CS, Dreamweaver CS, Flash CS, I use Virtual Machines with Database Management Applications, and I play Bluray movies too with great quality. Just one limitation, it hasn't bluetooth but I don't have problem with that. I put 5 stars simply because I love this laptop. <3::juancpove::5.0::January 10, 2014

RXYMYBR8I6DW8::Primo little package::OK, it's true, people who are new to computers are what every vendor is only too happy to sell whatever to. You gotta do the homework. But the ones who complain about how a vendor won't take a system back with just a few insignificant chihuahua bites on it are the same ones who complain when they get a system that has been repackaged after being "ripped to shreds by some vicious beast". But back to the Sony. There are fundamentally 4 types of portables these days: desktop replacements (DR), notebooks, tablets and phones. The DRs are 17" machines that are perfect if you need a real computer with you that "only" weighs like 10 lbs. The phones and tablets are pretty self-evident. The Notebook genre are what we're dealing with here. They're streamlined computers with 13-15" screens, no hot hardware graphics support and light weight, around 5 lbs. These days you can get those down to the four hundred dollar range. But things get pretty minimal at that price.The Sony is IMHO a very reasonable compromise in that it's got some serious chops for a notebook. It's not one of the $2K+ micro-Ferraris, that sport a 14" screen but a uranium case and all the goodies you can imagine. The i5 is an appropriately fast CPU w/ 2 cores (4 threads) running up to 3 Ghz, an appropriate 640 GB drive, 4 USB2 ports, an "8 hour" battery and a CD/DVD burner. The 4GB RAM is of course too little, and they should have used a single 4GB stick to make it cheaper to upgrade to the more appropriate 6-8GB (on a 64 bit OS, especially with shared RAM video). The extras are nice. Decent Camera, HDMI out, SD etc card slots, gigabit ethernet, WiFi. The "goodies" you might miss if you want a serious DR aren't there: Accelerated graphics, USB3, Bluetooth, Blu-Ray, Firewire, expansion card slot. And so? The trade-off is you can carry this with you everywhere, it's thin and light, it's a fast processor, and it runs for many hours on a charge (not 8, come on, unless you're into watching the screen-saver or nodding out and typing with your forehead in Notepad).I got ours on sale for like five fifty, and added forty bucks in RAM and twenty for a mouse. Would have gotten the white, but it was over a hundred more. It's sort of a Macbook for the rest of us in that it's well-made, not ugly, it has everything we need, not too expensive, and it's very very handy. The keyboard and trackpad are not luxurious, but fine. The fourteen inch 1366x768 screen is nice, the image/color is clean, it plays back 720p HD native, and 1080 just fine. Again, you are not getting accelerated gamer graphics, or a 1080p native screen. You just have to decide if you need a Notebook or a DR. I have an older HP 17" DR that almost killed several stewardesses coming out of the overheads, and I swore the next laptop was not going to be a back-breaker. The one shortcoming on the Sony that's hard to understand is the really low volume on the speakers - I haven't found a way yet to boost it, say by tweaking the EQ. That irritating detail and the "toss 2 sticks" RAM upgrade path cost it a star. And don't pay list! Other than that it's a primo little Notebook.::Fernand Ray::4.0::June 28, 2012
R32DZAOPXQQV92::Great Laptop !::I got the Sony VAIO EG2 14 inch (Blush Pink) Laptop for my wife to start College.  She Loves it, Not only the fast programs but the whole computers set up.  Also its cool looking design and she just loves the color.  This Laptop for the price is outstanding and to me performs just as fast if not better then a MAC.  Also, my wife has no problems with any programs... like her friends do with there MAC's not wanting to perform with programs not made by MAC.  I almost went all out and bought the Name.. I'm so happy I did not... This Computer is great and does everything she needs!::Robert J. Fairweather "Robert J. Fairweather"::5.0::December 26, 2011

R2ST31FAWA4KRZ::Great laptop, but not fully satisfied.::Alright, I bought this Sony Vaio through PCNation for about 690 dollars with factory sealed packaging and warranty. I could of have got a better deal with other sellers for around 650 dollars. I was originally suppose to receive it in 1-3 days but the delivery delayed until the following week. PCNation shipping and handling really sucked. The charge to return the laptop was very pricey for me, about a $110 dollar out-of-pocket expense because I opened the package. Also, about $100 dollar battery adapter replacement because my sister's stupid chihuahua chewed on a little bit of the wire, and they couldn't accept a damaged battery adapter. The adapter works brand new and they couldn't accept it because of that small portion of the wire that was chewed on so I decided just to keep the laptop instead of paying all that money just to return it. I'm a freshman in college and I use this laptop for school. So far, I like almost everything about the laptop; the performance, the 8-hour battery life,the keyboard, and it's weight. So the price of this laptop is probably reasonable because of the specs.What I really hate about is the small display and the graphics card. The screen is too small, and when I'm using the laptop I would have to scoot up closer to read what's on the screen, and I would have to slouch down in order to see everything on the screen so a 15 inch laptop would've been more suitable for me. The graphics card is an Intel HD 3000 and it's decent but it's not that great when watching 360p+ youtube videos and video editing. Also, 640 GB, I doubt I would need that much, 500 GB would've probably been okay for me and the price could've been lower.My regret is that I could have got a better deal with an 15 inch ASUS or an HP Laptop for the same specs and for a price around $500 dollars with a 1-year norton anti-virus program and Microsoft Office 2010 amounting about to the same price of how much I purchased this Sony Vaio. This Sony Vaio is my first laptop and prior to purchasing it I wasn't very knowledgeable of laptop values. I went to bestbuy, I checked out numerous sites and reviews on laptops and the bad reviews usually swayed me from not selecting that laptop. I couldn't find any reviews for this Sony Vaio so there were no bad reviews to sway me from not buying it.For any first time laptop buyer, I recommend buying from a store like best buy and check out the laptop first-hand to see if you really wanted instead of ordering online.I asked numerous people of advice on buying a laptop. And at least now I have a better understanding of laptops and I will know what laptop I would buy on my own next time without the help of other people.Overall, I wouldn't recommend anyone getting this laptop, it's too overpriced for it's specs.::BboyBP::2.0::December 27, 2011
R2EKJ2EF0IBBNH::Modest upgrade to an already great package.::I was looking for the previous model Toshiba Portege R835 P70 for some time.  After reading all reviews on portable lightweight laptops, I was sold on it.  i5 2410 processor, 4GB RAM, and ~3lb weight were great specs.  I recently noticed it had been discontinued and there was no apparent replacement on Toshiba's website.  That was until Toshiba magically quietly added this new, updated model to their website last week.  The Portege R835 P81 takes an already stout laptop and makes it that much better!  Now it has an i5 2435 processor rated higher and 2 more GB of RAM (to a total of 6GB).  While it only has a 640GB HDD at 5400rpm, it starts up quick and gets going.  I love that it's so light weight and makes my life a ton easier in my day to day operations running my business.  I needed portability since I spend the better part of my day meeting clients at homes and businesses, and this laptop does the job.  I looked into Macbook Airs, Samsung 9 series etc., but nothing beats this computer for the "bang-for-your-buck" factor.  I recommend this laptop for anyone that wants a smaller form factor that will last you a long time.::Matthew R. Byrne "Byrner13"::5.0::October 6, 2011
RJCOSFV91ZUWM::Powerful, Lightweight, Reliable, what's not to love?::Update: 1/13/11This will be the last update. My girlfriend and I broke up and she returned the laptop to me because she doesn't feel comfortable having it anymore. I've sold it on Auction on Ebay for $680.00. This is still a great laptop and I'm truly disappointed I will not get to see it again. I'm thankful for all the positives feedback I've been receiving about this review and I'm very happy to help out. As you can see, the reviews are growing slowly for this laptop so you should feel very confident you won't be disappointed in this laptop.As for my girlfriend and I, we're not talking anymore and she's gone ahead and purchased her own new laptop, a Sony.Update: 11/21/11There was a few problems regarding wifi on this Toshiba where it wouldn't connect to networks that require a password within the browser (workplace or school network where it required your id number/username). We tried using an external wifi adapter via USB and it turned out it still wouldn't connect. I called Amazon and verified with them there seem to be something wrong with the Wifi, it would connect successfully at home or on a mobile hotspot but not at work/school. Amazon was very prompt and got a supervisor approval to send a new replacement laptop with free one day shipping. We tried it out just today at both work and school and now it works just superbly!I'd like to give FIVE STARS to AMAZON for their great customer support, I've been buying from them constantly since 2006 and they've been nothing but fantastic towards treating me like their VIP customer.Besides that, we now have a like new laptop again, and I'm not really concern about moving data back and forth to the hard drive because of my expertise in computers. I've been reading other reviews, yes this laptop is quite delicate but this laptop is so light of course it's going to be fragile! The keyboard seems just fine, it's not an exactly nice finish like a macbook but it's still just a decent keyboard. The webcam has not provide much issue, I webcam with my girlfriend almost every other night and I can hear her clearly and see her clearly just fine. She would even point the webcam at our fish pet and I could see the fish even in low lighting!Currently my girlfriend is a moderate business worker and full time student and this laptop has been nothing but quick, fast, and lightweight for her. Even I'm enjoying playing with it now and then over my White Unibody Macbook.Update: 11/8/11Its been over two weeks. The laptop is still running strong and there hasn't been any problems at all. My girlfriend mentioned during her class someone complimented on her laptop stating that it's so lightweight and you don't see many lightweight laptops with an i5 processor. We purchased this case (attached item name below) and it fits perfectly and very easy to put in and out. There has been no issues with the battery life, it's still very long exactly as stated. The wireless connection has been superb. There has been some Toshiba software that may be bloatware, but half of it is actually useful compared to other laptops. Toshiba really focused on making programs that is truly essential for the user.Case Logic QNS-113 13.3-Inch EVA Molded Laptop Macbook Air/Pro Sleeve (Black)Update: 10/31/11It's been over a week. This laptop has been nothing but fantastic for my girlfriend. No problems whatsoever. Very quick and fast at both starting up and turning off. There was some skeptical questions regarding the battery life. At 90% it said there was 4 hours of battery left, but once it went down to 70% it said there was 6 hours of battery left. Regardless overall depending on the usage, just surfing the internet and doing light word processing it goes beyond seven hours which is plenty of time away from a power outlet.-=[ ~~~ ]=-I'm a very tech savvy person and have worked with all kinds of laptops from Toshiba, Acer, Asus, HP, Compaq, and Apple. I have to say I'm amazed of how great this Portege is, it's definitely lighter than many of their rivals, and it carries an i5 Sandy Bridge processor, and it's equipped with a large amount of ram and hard drive space.From Squaretrade Warranty, Toshiba was rank #2 in reliability in laptops with the least malfunctions after three years, with Asus landing at #1. The reason why I prefer Toshiba is because they only make Netbooks/Laptops in the computing world. All the other brands they make laptops/desktops/all in one pcs. Toshiba however, only focuses on portable computing.I've worked with the previous Portege, the R700 /w the i3 processor. The one thing that blew me away was that it's a 3 pound 13.3 inch laptop. The Macbook Air at the time was lighter but it didn't have an i3 processor. This new updated model though was a great find for me. I was looking around for a new laptop for my girlfriend. She asked for a bigger monitor than her netbook, much faster, and something that would last for a long time.The screen seems pretty reflective in high lighted setting, say outdoor in the sun, this may boast as an issue for some. However, 90% of the usage on a laptop for many users out there is indoor. When using this indoor I see no problem whatsoever. It plays very smoothly HD quality videos with no lag. The brightness is very bright as well, I see myself turning the brightness down mostly and could still see just fine. It's bright enough on medium setting and it's LED.The i5 2.4 ghz processor is one of the latest ones for laptop thats just about right for your everyday multitasking job. It also has a turbo boost technology that could crank it up to speed to 3.0 ghz if it needs to under big work overload. This is useful for those gamers out there or those who want to do photoshop.It has 640gb HD. Usually laptops have 250GB or 320GB but this has 640GB!!! That is twice as big as the average laptop HD size! You will not have to worry for a long time regarding laptop space on this laptop. Trust me, if you're not going to be downloading many movies or plan to put 1,000,000 pictures on this thing, you're going to be really happy wit this large amount of space.6GB of ram, this is what lets you run multiple applications and windows at the same time. 4GB ram seems to be the average of most laptops, so again it goes beyond the standards once again. You can run ten internet windows, watch a movie, and run a webcamming conference and that 6GB of ram will let you run everything just fine without any lag, thanks to that large ram.Only 3.2 pounds. Tats less than a pound more than those really light netbooks out there. Netbooks go for 2.5 pounds, the Portege is at 3.2 pounds, and the Macbook Pro goes for 4.5 pounds. It's very ultraportable and can fit nicely inside your handbag/backpack, it's also very thin as well. This laptop quality is very durable material as well. It's not some cheap plastic material, it's actually well made like a professional. If you didn't know yet, Portege is a business designed laptop.Lastly, with this entire processor, ram, hard drive space, and being ultraportable, how long will the battery last? It says on the standards it should be 9 hours long! That's amazing! I however have heard about tests and from real life tests you'd probably be getting 7 hours of battery  life realistically. But the great part is that Toshiba has the "ecosaver" program equipped that really helps conserve the battery longer and helps you measure how much "watts" you're using.Overall for the price, this makes a great laptop, and the best part is this just came out quietly this month, October 2011. I plan to update this review as the months go by to see if my girlfriend runs into any problems. But comparing this to my Unibody White Macbook. I think this laptop seems to be much more powerful and faster than mine. It's light weight, powerful with a great processor, up to date on going beyond the standards on RAM and Harddrive space, and long lasting battery life to get you through your day on the go. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.::T. A. Dinh "iAmAlexander408"::5.0::October 24, 2011
R2URLP29H8CWEJ::Slow hard drive; Flawed BIOS; Customer support non-existent::I'm an IT professional and have used tons of laptops. This Toshiba laptop is very light compared to the macbook pro 13'', and has good battery life. Build quality is also good. However, it has some major drawbacks -- its hard drive, BIOS, and customer service.The stock hard drive is 5200rpm which is on the slow side. Besides, Toshiba put lots of redundant software on top of windows 7. The result is that starting windows and some apps takes a long time. One resolution to fix the slowness is to get a SSD to replace the slow hard drive. Now here comes the 2nd drawback -- its BIOS.The SSD I purchased is very fast and supports Sata III. However, the BIOS only supports Sata II which forces the SSD to work at a much lower speed. Note that the Intel chipset built in the laptop does support Sata III; it's just Toshiba's BIOS disabled the Sata III speed. This issue applies to the whole R835 series and has been discussed a lot online. Many people have complained to Toshiba and requested them to enable Sata III.To my surprise, Toshiba decided to ignore customers' feedback and requests. Their CSR is simply not answering customers' questions. It's very simply for them to change the BIOS and enable Sata III, but they simply choose not to do it. Very disappointed w/ their customer service attitude.In summary, the price is simply too high for this handicapped device. Many other laptops at this price fully supports Sata III. Unless they fix the issue, I won't recommend it to anyone who wants to get the speed out of the money they spend (which they deserve for this price).::gtech::2.0::November 9, 2011
R18FLH2G9XEUH0::HDD is slow, Buy an SSD::Hi,If your wondering about getting this laptop, well, just go ahead and get it because it's great.(I own the R835-P56x, very similar)BUT! Here's a few things you need to be aware of.Pros:-Super Light-Great battery life(over 6-7hr on mine)-Eco Mode actually works, brings power consumption to 9-11watts-Fast CPU, Windows movie maker takes care of 720p content easily.-Feels great, keyboard is fine with me.-Plays Dirt 3 at 720p on med-high settings. Portal 2 on high at 1080p. Using .2559 Driver-DVD drive in such a small laptop, it doesn't use the battery hardly at all.Cons:-Display doesn't WOW-The hard drive is flippin slow. Buy a $120 120GB ssd from newegg.com. I got the Intel 320 series for 120 after rebate. Windows experience index now 7.7-RAM, 4 is ok but I got ADATA XPG Gaming Series 8GB from Newegg.com WEI now 7.5-Speakers are absolute crap but it's a 3LB laptop so I can't complain. The headphone jack puts out amazing quality.***** BlOATWARE is terrible **** - The first thing I did was find my student copy of windows 7 and installed that from scratch. You do NOT want Toshiba's recovery crap installed on an SSD.-The mouse left and right are noisy but you can just double click in the trackpad. Also put up the sensitivity of the pad in the settings.-SATA 3 disabled by Toshiba BIOS, 2 is more reliable anywayThat about sums it up. BTW, the bios startup is wicked fast, especially with an SSD. Go ahead and laugh at the macbook pro next to you.Drivers you will need to download after a fresh install of Win:-Toshiba Value Added(To make the keyboard functions work)-Realtec Audio Drivers(I got them from realtec), windows standard drivers work too-USB 3.0 Driver(From toshiba)-Intel Raid Storage Technogy(MUST download from toshiba), it doesn't come out of sleep properly if not installed.::CCK::5.0::January 1, 2012
R3CEFHEUEFUTTZ::Great Lightweight::I own the Toshiba P25 Portege  for the last 18 month's. It has been a very good lightweight Laptop.  I  concur with the other reviews in their overall opinions. I noted a lower price at ToshibaDirect at $799.00 this week. Ofice Max offers a similar model with 4gig memory for $799.00 presently.Just noticed Costco now sells similar model with a couple of extras for $799.00 OfficeMax selling the 4gig model for $699.00.::William H Frieswyk::5.0::November 2, 2011
R302V0BO57ZOVY::portege r835-p81::So far I love it.  Very light, the battery seems to last forever and it is really fast.  I bought this model because cnet listed it in their top ten laptop buys and their review was very extensive.  Like other comments, I wish it had a backlit keyboard and yes the sound is a bit tinny sounding.  (I'll try in the future to correct the sound)  Anyway, very happy with Amazon.  Ordered laptop on Thursday in the a.m. and recieved it the next day by noon!  As far as Toshiba, time will tell whether or not I will be happy with Toshiba.  But as of today, I Love it!  If your considering the R835-P56X, don't bother because the R835-P81 is the newer model, has more memory, and is cheaper.  Go to CNET and read the reviews on this laptopIt has been 8 months and I still love this laptop!  Love Amazon!::gettysburg::4.0::December 5, 2011
RBXYTK61IGTNY::Great product, but not entirely as advertised::I love this computer.  Considering that I used to have a Dell E1505, which I affectionately referred to as "The Brick," this computer is a wonderful replacement.  Its lightweight and so far very durable.  Don't be pessimistic about the battery life!  It really does last just about that long!  I took my new laptop on a recent vacation, and after watching a 2.5 hour movie on a flight, I still had about 5.5 hours of battery life left after the movie ended.  The battery life was a huge selling point of this laptop for me, and I'm glad that it has been as advertised.I had read previously that Toshiba's don't have the greatest screens, but I haven't noticed that at all with this computer.  It is very sharp!The only complaints I would have are 1) too many pre-loaded Toshiba apps, but this isn't really a problem.  More like an irritation, but it doesn't take away from the computer.  and 2) Maybe I'm just inept in some way, but I only see 2 USB ports.  Toshiba advertised 4 on this computer, and Amazon advertised 3.  But, I still only see 2.  This might be a deal breaker for some people.::Ellyn::4.0::November 8, 2011
R25FUR6IJNPWO7::just as I'd hoped::I've been looking at the Toshiba Portege series for quite a while, as I wanted a computer that is ultra lightweight and still has a built in optical drive. There aren't a lot of choices in that niche, and they tend to be a lot more expensive. But people still give me a fair amount of things in the form of DVDs or CDs, and I wanted to be able to use them without having to plug in an external drive.I've only had this one a few days as yet (bought from Amazon at $799, oddly the price has gone up a bit since then). I was convinced to buy by the i5 processor update, the big 6 RAM update, the huge-capacity hard disk. I had been hesitating between this and the Z series one, without the built in drive and lighter, but ended up with this--for anyone who doesn't care about DVD/CD drive, the Z would be the way to go, the best bargain currently around, it looks to me, for a 2.4 lb computer.I am completely happy with this machine so far. Nice feel, big screen compared to my former HP 10" netbook. I don't have any complaints except that the optical disk drive carriage does seem a bit flimsy--the plastic snap-on outer edge came off while I was making the Recovery Disks, and the whole thing feels a bit fragile; but at least edge bit did snap right back into place. While I've not yet tried this out with my portable printer, I also like that this machine has multiple USB ports (three, including a new 3.0 one) and ethernet port, in case I ever need that for a hotel. For reliably doing actual work while travelling, this is still, for me at least, a far better choice than a tablet or iPad, even with the add-on keyboard, because of the standard ports, SD card reader, and so on. (Though for trips when I'll only need a bit of email and web access, I'm waiting on the next, larger-screened Kindle Fire we've been told might be coming.)I notice that another reviewer spoke of a noisy fan. I do think that fans are one of those things that vary a lot between individual computers--I've had other laptops with loud ones--but this one, for me, is virtually silent.Overall--nice keyboard, nice size, screen seems great for how I used it, and a truly fully loaded computer in a lightweight vehicle. So far I'm delighted every time I open the cover and use it. BIG leap upward from the 10" netbook I was using before--much faster processor and big RAM is making a difference even for normal use with the web, and the start-up after hibernation is pretty much instantaneous. It's nice to actually LIKE my computer again.::B J Millar::5.0::November 26, 2011
RBCJVH4VG5W1E::close to perfect::MacBookPro Comparison:I sold my less than a year old over $2000 MacBookPro to get this computer and am very happy with it. It is faster, weighs only half of the Apple and I don't have software issues anymore. I have to use Windows software and to run it with Parallels slowed the MacBookPro down to a point where you could not work with it anymore.  The Apple operating system is a pain if you go outside writing a single letter and listening to music.  If you have a bunch of windows open, Windows 7 gives you a preview at the taskbar (I oftentimes have >5 PDF's open), at this point Mac OS is clearly not user friendly, not to mention the keyboard shortcuts you have to know.  I should have read the following article before making a decision:  [...]At home I have a 27" Samsung Monitor that I use with my Toshiba (compare two letter size windows side by side, HDMI connection, more upright seating position) and a wireless keyboard.  This is a much better configuration for me, since I work many hours on a computer every day.The Toshiba has a USB 3.0 and a eSATA for fast backup if needed.  The USB 3.0 stopped working, which is a driver issue and can be fixed by installing the new driver.  The keyboard is nice but keys are somewhat slippery, which I can get used to when on the road.  Otherwise, size, weight, screen, touch-pad no problems.  Long battery life.::silverbullet::5.0::January 13, 2012
ROEXPUUIVEGL7::Great all-around portable laptop, especially with upgrade to SSD::I have been using this Toshiba Portege R835-P81 consistently for 1 ½ months (I purchased it in early December) and, in general, I think it's great!Pros:- Very light (approx. 3.2 lbs) - it feels very light (with the power cord) in my backpack- Sturdy - I feel comfortable picking it up and carrying it with one hand (the one exception is that the hinges are made of shiny plastic and feel cheap)- Long battery life - In my experience, about 4 hours with heavy usage (multi-tasking, watching streaming videos); 6 hours with mixed usage; up to 8 hours using Toshiba's eco Utility and brightness dimmed to Level 4 (mostly notetaking and emailing)- Good trackpad (with button to turn off quickly if using an external mouse)- Wide variety of ports (2 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0/eSATA, HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, SD card reader)- Runs cool (does not emit much heat; fan runs very rarely)- Value (at the right price point compare to ultabooks and MacBook Air (when upgrade hard drive to SSD)Cons:- Screen is average - not amazing, but fine for my daily use (1366 x 768 resolution; vertical viewing is not great).  I sometimes connect it to my HD TV to watch movies, etc., but have also watched quite a few hours of streaming video on the 13 inch screen.  The screen seems a bit fragile (depresses a bit in the middle when closed) - but this is to be expected with such a light machine.  No issues over the past 1 ½ months, but I am careful and always travel with it in a laptop sleeve.- No backlit keyboard or Bluetooth (understandable for the price point).  It took me a few hours to get used to typing on the chicklet style keyboard, but now have no issues.  Keystrokes are also a bit load.- Trackpad buttons are loud (and more difficult to depress than the past two laptops I've owned).  However, this is not much of an issue as I mostly tap to select when using the trackpad.- Horrible sound from built-in speakers (not a deal-breaker for me as I mostly use headphones, external speakers)- Toshiba bloatwareOverall:I'm giving this laptop 4 stars as I feel that this laptop presents a great value given its excellent performance (particulary with SSD) and portability.  I paid $699 for the laptop and $185 for an Intel 320 Series 120 GB SSD.  The total cost of my system was approx.. $885, which approaches the Portege ultrabook, but includes a Core-i5 processor, 6 GB of RAM, a wide array of ports, an optical drive, and ultrabook/MacBook Air-like quickness, but comes in a bit of a thicker form factor.  I did use it for a few days without the SSD and was still happy with the performance, but thought that the 5400 RPM hard drive did not pair well with the Sandy Bridge processor.  Once you've used a SSD, it's hard to go back!With the SSD startup is fast (16 seconds to log in screen; 9 seconds from log in to loaded desktop with wifi connected), shutdown is fast (8 seconds), and programs load extremely quickly (e.g., MS Office Suite and web browsers are almost instantaneous).I would give this laptop 5 stars if a few things could be improved (if only slightly): the screen, built-in speakers, and keyboard (see above).  However, I think these are fairly minor issues and have not had an impact on my regular usage of the machine.  Also, while the included hard drive has a lot of space (640 GB) I found it to be a little bit slow.Overall, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight and portable, well-built and fast laptop.  I'd recommend replacing the hard drive with an SSD if you are able to get a good deal on the laptop.  At $699, I felt the price was exceptional for all of the included features and left some money in my budget to buy a SSD.::Ryan G.::4.0::January 26, 2012
RI3K4W369GK6P::solid traveler::This one was a last minute impulse buy; I had already carefully selected another brand and model, but while reading reviews, I kept running across this Toshiba as the "benchmark" for comparison.  What convinced me was the fact that this model was about the same weight and dimensions, yet included a built-in DVD burner; as compared to the other system which had no burner.What I don't like:  I really wish it had 3 USB ports, but I can get by with 2.  I also dislike the power jack, which protrudes out and tends to always be in the way.  It really should have been a right angle jack. Lastly, the Lan port is in an odd position on the side, and upside down compared to most others I have seen.The weight and battery life are superb.I haven't really timed it, but I am sure I am getting close to 8 hours with very light usage.  The hard drive protection system is extremely sensitive, and the unit has a pretty solid feel considering the light weight. While I do use this mainly for business, I don't consider myself a "power user", so I cannot adequately address the criticisms of speed which some reviewers have pointed out.  I would think you will need some type of performance rating program or big video game to even tell the difference between models today.  So if you are working with a spreadsheet, have Outlook open and running, and maybe writing a Word document at the same time, this unit will serve you well. But if you think having a 5400 RPM hard drive might keep you up nights, then pass and look for a machine at twice the price that will still be obsolete in 2 weeks anyway.::madmac::5.0::May 19, 2012
R2E1GCEOZD1W21::Great unit but the P94 will save U $$::The Toshiba R835-P81 is a very good laptop. I did not buy this one, I purchased the Toshiba R835-P94 instead. The P94 is the same computer except the P94 also has Bluetooth and is over $100 cheaper. The P94 is an Amazon exclusive, which probably accounts for the lower price. The P81 comes with 6 GB of ram while the P94 only has 4 GB. The 4 GB of ram is fine for most applications and most users, but I like to max-out my ram. I bought two 4 GB high speed ram modules (a total of 8 GBs) for $46 and the P94 is noticeably faster. Installation of the ram is very easy.A real shocker was discovering that the battery power lasts almost as long as advertised. Amazing! I have never had a laptop that even came close to this one.I'm not a "gamer" so I can't speak to its capabilities in that arena, but I have watched streaming movies, and DVD's with no problems. The only negative things that I have noticed so far are that it has a narrow vertical viewing angle. I'm comparing it to my old Sony Vaio which has a larger and very good screen. The other negative is the ton of bloat ware programs that Toshiba loads on the computer. I doubt that you will ever use the majority of them. Sadly, it seems that all of the manufacturers are doing this now.Overall, hard to beat at this price.::Kenneth McWilliams::5.0::March 8, 2012
R1YP02OCO9J83G::Perfect for what I need::I think of myself as the "average" computer user. I am not in school, but need a laptop vs. tablet for my apt. manager job (something I could use Office and other programs on). I wanted the transport-ability of a tablet though. This laptop is perfect for me. It's small light, powerful for what I need it for, and does the job.One this that does drive me crazy is that sometimes I'll hit the ctrl button, and it'll cause the keyboard to tab instead of type letters. I did this the first day and almost had a meltdown because I could not figure out what the heck I had pushed. So frustrating. I called Toshiba customer service and the dude who helped me was patient, and helped me get it back to normal. When I finally realized what I had done (after doing this a couple more times), it was an easy fix. So I guess the one con could be that the keyboard is slightly cramped :)As somebody who uses a laptop for work, internet, netflix, and other basic tasks, as well as somebody who wanted a laptop to tote around easily for travel, the Toshiba Portege fits the bill. I love it. Now, I don't know anything about SSDs, and Bios and all that fun stuff, but if there's hardware out there that will make this awesome machine work even better, I'm excited, and I might even look into it in the future. But for now, I'm happy with the basic package.::Tiffany::5.0::January 3, 2012
R1SSDLQLRMP0KB::Lightweight yet powerful::Pros:1. Amazingly light! Feel like nothing compared with my Thinkpad T400. The charger is smaller too.2. Powerful! With i5-2435M CPU and 6G RAM, it runs smoothly on almost all the programs I need.3. Has USB 3.0, E-SATA/Powered USB(on the left side, different with the pictures on Amazon), HDMI, SD card reader.4. The battery can last for 5 hrs with normal operation.5. The buidling quality is great.Cons:1. The fan is a little noisy when running on full speed (CPU usage > 90%).2. The keyborad dose not feel as good as Thinkpad (but acceptable).3. No keyborad light/backlight.4. The speakers are very small and sounds terrible.5. The build-in camera has only 30M pixels (barely enough).Overall, It is a great lightweight laptop and I really like it. The cons listed above are acceptable for me so I give it five stars.::Harper::5.0::December 29, 2011
R3OZJ4ZTZUYOXA::so far so great!!::Initially i bought a lenovo from their official website but maybe due to black friday's high demand, they are extremely slow!! i waited it for about two weeks still no sign of shipping then started to look for other alternatives. and i saw this!  The configuration is better than the lenovo one. i give speed and weight as my top priority. so this one perfectly fits me as it has i5 processor and its only as light as 3.2 pounds!!! so i made the fastest decision ever for electronic products, i immediately ordered it!Plus only when i got it that i realize how good its battery life is!! (especially compared with my old HP laptop which can barely last for 2 hours) now its been about two weeks, averagely, an almost full charged battery can last for 6/7 easily. AMAZING!!There is another series called Toshiba Portege R835-P56Toshiba Portégé R835-P56x 13.3-Inch LED Laptop (Magnesium Blue). YES, it has more reviews and higher score. BUT it is also more expensive and if you compare the configuration it is actually worse than this one!!so if you want to make a smart choice, i highly recommend this one.hope this would be helpful. Merry Xmas and happy new year!::fong::5.0::December 27, 2011
R1MKXCMID6OBQQ::Solid laptop & great value::I recently purchased a Toshiba Portege R835-P81 laptop and have really enjoyed it. I based my purchase on a good experience with a prior Toshiba and an excellent review on Cnet.com for the laptop. It was a great deal on Amazon.  I considered the new Toshiba Z835 Ultrabook but decided on this laptop because it had a faster chip (i-5), a better keyboard for typing (I found the Z835 keyboard to be cheap and flimsy) and a better value. The R835 offers great bang for the buck and I am glad that I bought it.::RRubin::5.0::January 18, 2012
R2SJI4KQ4CVXWQ::powerful computer system rolled into one tiny package.::I just received this item yesterday so I can't really say that I have tested this system to it's limit just yet.Initial impressions leaves me coming away impressed.Of course the first boot up was painful to say the least.I can honestly say this is the most amount of crapware I've seen preloaded onto a notebook.After creating a system recovery disc, I immediately reinstalled a fresh copy of windows 7 professional 64bits onto this.After that everything was just perfect.Boot up times were relatively fast,(for a 5400rpm HDD system)I believe that this note book will really shine with a SSD, which is why I will be purchasing and installing one very soon, hopefully around next week.Battery life is insanely good. I can easily last 7-8 hours with this with general computering tasks such as excel, word and powerpoint.The screen on this notebook was fine, though I wish that it would come with a matte screen instead.However, for the audio department as many other others before me had commented, the speakers are the most horrible teeniest thing I've ever heard in my life.I also wish that this thing would come with a backlit keyboard as I personally find backlit keyboard to be incredibly useful.But I guess there is only so much that Toshiba can give us for 749.99 right?::Amazon Customer::5.0::January 17, 2012
RB18V6LEKAWGT::I love my ugy duckling::Electronics and I frequently don't get along, but from the second I pulled this kind of ugly little computer from the box it was love, from it's brushed steel facade to it's weird CSI font keyboard.It's the only one I found well under $1,000 at such a small size and weight with such a powerful processor. I like to do a lot of things at once and become inordinately angry over things like freezing programs, jumpy video playback, and waiting for things to open and load. I plug this little guy into a big HD TV and it runs streaming HD content effortlessly, even while I have 5 other things running at the same time. I can't speak for gaming, but for Windows programs and streaming video, this computer performs really well.It also has a monster hard drive compared to everything else I was looking at, which is great to have all that storage space available as files and programs keep getting bigger.I saw some reviews here from more tech-savvy people about this type of hard drive performing slowly, but speaking as a non-tech specialist who uses a fancy brand new imac all day at work, no functions of this computer have seemed slow whatsoever.It has 3 USB ports, 1 VGA, 1 HDMI, a card reader, and a CD/DVD burner that I have yet to use. I find the track pad very easy to use. The keys are a little smaller than usual (slightly rectangular) but the keyboard is very easy to type on. The battery life is great; I'm getting 3-4 hours with constant media playing, 6-7 hours typing and web browsing. It's really lightweight. I had it in my backpack and dropped the backpack on the concrete sidewalk a few weeks ago; so far so good.Cons: Well, nobody's perfect. Ok, the speakers definitely do suck. There is a keyboard control for mute/un-mute, but not for adjusting the volume. The display is not great - the colors are a little washed out on the screen. It comes with a lot of crap on it (like most computers these days). It's fatter than other similar laptops because it has an optic drive (but not heavier).I'm so glad I sent back the adorable, crappy HP I ordered first and traded it for this industrial-looking awesomesauce computer. Highly recommended!::PJ::5.0::January 6, 2012
R17JBYBT5B64MF::Thin, light, great battery and a great size::After debating between this and several others, I settled on the Portege 835-81 here on Amazon.  I see now why the folks a Cnet liked this computer.  It works great, boots fast and is a great replacement for my obsolete Dell XPS.  Love having the onboard DVD drive that takes so little space.  Battery life has been great and I've had no issues with it running hot.  Performance is crisp and while I do very little gaming it handles all my apps with grace.  Price performance makes this difficult to beat.  Keep an eye on the price as it changes with the day of the week.::Amazon Customer::5.0::December 15, 2011
RH2KHO73O0CMD::Report after a year - still very satisfied, almost perfectly::I've now had this Toshiba for a year and still love it.  The strength of the case compared to previous Portege which cost twice as much is excellent and the light weight (about 3 lbs.) a joy.  Thinness and feel and look are all great and make it a pleasure to pull it out of a case at a meeting or anywhere else.  Speed of everything I do is fine and I often load it up with 4-5 intensive programs.  I did notice a small crack on the screen shortly after I got it which was like a hairline about 1" long, showing no apparent cause but Toshiba would not cover fixing it.  Since it didnt affect the use of the screen, I've just left it there since it seemed to cause no other problem.  Still, after paying for a new computer, it would seem they should consider that it might be a mfg defect.  They didn't even consider it.On their repair system: I cant work without my computer for a week or two so it can be fixed, if necessary.  Thats what they do OR take it to my local authorized repair place, which has since disappeared.  So I hope I never have to get a repair.  Toshiba should have a better solution for business computer repairs.  Maybe they do?  Best ask them.When I bought it from Amazon, it arrived with a slightly smaller hard drive than was specified in their ad, so I contacted them and was given an immediate price adjustment that satisfied me.I opened up an Amazon Charge card (GE) for this purchase and had a year with no interest and just paid off the balance so there was no interest charge.  The bad part - this card would charge $25 for a late fee on a $25 payment a day or two late.  While that was very high, it should be noted that a call to them would often get it forgiven - obviously, I had gotten the payment there late a few times to learn this.  I wont use this card again because it has a 25% interest rate, for some reason, which is almost an insult and seems that GE and Amazon are almost hoping you screw up so they can catch you and say - opps, you now have a 25% interest rate.  Offsetting that feeling on my part, they didnt actually do that and every statement warned up front of the payoff date to get the no interest for a year.  Bottom line, I would be careful of the terms on this Amazon card, and use it carefully and only where there was no interest being paid.Bottom line grades: Amazon A, Toshiba Product A, Toshiba Support B, GE B+::Michael F.

R3V0EFY1ZGLEDR::Best Ever::My Dell Quosmio laptop died. I had it for nearly 5 yrs and really loved it. I am not the kind of guy to get the latest every time some more bells and whistles comes out. I buy the best and keep it for years. A good friend of mine suggested this Toshiba Portege. He said they were one of the best. And boy is he right! This is the fastest laptop I have ever had. And the battery life is amazing. I can use it for hours and the battery still has many hours left. It is so light and portable. If you want a good, fast, reliable laptop that is very thin, look no farther. I am very please I bought this one. It will serve me well for many years. Just a note, in my address I included my PO Box along with my physical address. Don't do this, it took way longer to get here. They shipped USPS when it should have come UPS. So, only ship to your physical address and it will come much faster. Other than that everything came out just great.::John Martin::5.0::December 21, 2011
R30GC9393WJ2VM::Toshibe Portege R835-P81::I just got my laptop last week and updated it to Windows 7 Ultimate, my personal preference. I love it. As with most Windows OS, it takes a little while to boot. However, after it loads, the apps run very fast and smooth.The battery life is the best. I can leave my power adapter at home and use the laptop and at the end of the day, I still have battery life left.The only minor issue that I have with it is that the BIOS is not TPM ready. This would give me the option to install Bitlocker on all my drives, including the system drive.Other than that, I am very pleased with the product thus far.::BKC::5.0::December 5, 2011
RCW7TXT1NSUEA::so light it is hard to believe::I bought this about two years ago and it is still going just fine (even with intense use). I still cannot believe how light this thing is. When I was pulling it out of the box it actually almost slipped out of my hand because I used way too much force (expecting something much heavier). Overall a good buy for someone that feels the need to bring his/her laptop everywhere.::alelo::4.0::May 16, 2014
R1DEM8IUD6SEZZ::I loved it for two years: then it died::This was a great laptop for the money but it died after 23 months. It only had a one year warranty. I bought something to replace it that had a much longer warranty but costs about 75% more. Given that my job depends on my computer and it takes so long to get all my software installed, I felt like it was worth it. If this laptop had lasted 3 years or so ( the average replacement rate for me) this would have been the best buy laptop I had ever bought.::Dan Bear "Dan"::3.0::March 4, 2014
R27ZKD4AD7W5HF::Light but NOT durable::I mostly use this computer at home rarely take it with me to a class, presentations etc. The computer leaves my house 1-2 times per month and otherwise doesn't get moved around much.  Despite light use, the screen broke within a year- turned it on and the screen was solid white. Luckily it was still under warranty so the repair was free. However, it just broke again. The replacement screen is $150 plus labor. The computer store who fixed it both times said they see a lot of these.  Other than the flexible and flimsy plastic cover, there is nothing protecting the screen. Vibrations from a car or another book compressing on it a backpack can slightly dislodge and break the screen.  I like everything else about this computer but if it is flimsy, what is the point of having a lightweight small laptop?  I'm scared to move it without a bulky hard case.::sbaer::2.0::February 25, 2014

As such, my technical needs are minimal - I require a light machine with superb battery life for browsing the web, video chatting, and using a few consumer applications. This machine has met all of those needs commendably. I also find myself using it to play video on my television, so the HDMI connection has become valuable to me. My one quibble is with the amoutn of time it takes to wake up from "sleep" - honestly, I'm not sure that other current models (with current software) are any better about this, but it wakes more slowly than previous machines I've owned.::Amazon Customer::4.0::January 18, 2013
R3BFMDKVEABYXH::Exactly what I was looking for::It is my second Portege and , again, real value for money. I thought about the Dell Inspiron but this one's better.::M. Peled::4.0::December 11, 2012
R29CTJWDP4XSOP::Nice laptop::This is quite a good laptop - not top end but good enough for most things. I haven't quite figured out the USB charging gizmo which seems to conflict with sleep mode - so I pull out the USB cable to the externals. I did the BIOS update but that did not seem to help.Other than that - it's not too bulky for travel and does not weigh that much more than my netbook!::Roger Williams::4.0::November 24, 2012
RJHXPI2DSF615::Fine but that's all::The computer feels flimsy and the power cord keeps detaching itself from the unit. Since I bought it from one of Amazon's partners instead of Amazon directly, I cannot return or exchange it, so I'm stuck. Lesson learned.::D. Lindsay::2.0::November 14, 2012

R262UTTHFLB86W::Toshiba Portege R835-P81::I am pleased with all features of this smaller computer. It acts like a larger one with nothing seeingly lost in its size. I would definitely recommend this computer.::B. Schiltz "nutrbarb"::5.0::September 19, 2012
R3QP6GRIUGM5BZ::Well Worth It::I wanted to wait for a couple of months of use before leaving a review:Pros:FastLightThinGreat Battery lifeCheap (Note price on this thing fluctuates a lot but it can be had for ~$600-700 generally)Cons:Loud fan, constantly runsScreenSoundI was in the market for either MBA or Ultrabook. I used my girlfriends MBA and loved it, but I really needed a Windows sytem. If it wasn't for that fact, I probably would have just gone with the MBA. Build quality and everything about it was great, I just didn't see a point in buying Apple and running Windows 24/7 (tried Parallels and still had some issue with computing power/sluggishness). I looked at Ultrabooks, but they're just not there yet with spotty builds and a cost at the equivalent of an MBA. I looked at Toshiba's Ultrabook, but it just wasn't there spec-wise.This laptop is not without its fair share of flaws, but the upside and cost are just too much to overlook. Also, after replacing the DVD drive with an SSD to run a dual HDD/SSD, I couldn't be happier.::I can't stop buying stuff::5.0::February 25, 2012

R2FZHJAZOS8EGL::I love this laptop::The laptop feels well built and it is extremely light. It is small, but not too small for everyday use. I am a graduate student and this is perfect for carrying to and from school everyday. Great color. If any problems arise I will update my review. Runs fast too!::Jie Zhou::5.0::January 13, 2012
R3D8G21BV4Z0XF::Perfect as a lightweight laptop with ample processing and storage::Simply put, this laptop is very light, has a fairly good screen except the viewing angles are a bit narrow, has great connectivity and a USB 3.0 port as well as the ability to charge items even when it is off, has a big hard drive and a pretty decent processor.  It works well for photo storage and manipulation, music storage and itunes, and all the basic things you may need a laptop for, minus the heavy weight.  Computer shopping can be overwhelming, but the stats on this unit (see comparisons in CNET reviews) made it an easy purchase that did not break the bank.::outwest::4.0::January 5, 2012
R1GW3HJ6RDUVM7::Service with a smile...not much else::I bought this to replace my 4+ year laptop after regular crashes and realizing adding memory would only give me at maximum, 1GB of SDRAM.  I had this order shipped overnight.  Once I got it up, I saw right away how fast it was. Very pleased with the speed, picture sharpness, and preloaded with Google Chrome. But I couldn't get the new laptop on Internet Explorer or Chrome to do online crosswords and a few other very basic games.  I realized at the time I got the laptop, the instructions recommend you back up with media recovery, which wasn't included.  At the Toshiba site, the software is "free", however, postage and handling is $29.95.The best part about my old Sony Vaio was that as many times as it crashed, it always recovered.  Service was still available after 2 years of ownership and they got it back up for me within 10 minutes after it crashed due to a corrupt hard drive.  Not the Toshiba.  Got the first blue screen of death after 2 months and couldn't get it back up.I called Toshiba Service (not in the US) and they wouldn't help until I registered the product and still under warranty (has 1 month remaining).  Once I registered, I called Toshiba back and got through right away. But after a 30 minute (on hold 3 different times for at least 2 minutes) with the service tech, "Paul", he determined I needed to send the laptop out for repair.My very first laptop I got at work was a Toshiba and liked it so much, I ended up buying it after I was laid off from the company.  This laptop shipped to the service center today.  Hopefully, it'll be up and running with no other issues.  However, due to this experience, my next laptop/netbook won't be Toshiba.::Lani Chin::2.0::April 2, 2012
R1Q7KRFZYPMMCE::Software Warranty Support will cost you! (UPDATE)::REALLY UPSET. Make sure to read the fine print. The one year warranty is for hardware ONLY. After the first 30 days, I had the first 'Blue Screen of Death' at shutdown. Over time it happened more frequently, so I finally called Toshiba. I guess that you 90 days of FREE phone support. Their solution was to Disable ALL Startup programs. This solved the problem, but a real inconvenience. So I experimented with turning many back on. However, the 'wheel scroll' function on the touchpad didn't work. I discovered a work around by going to the Control Panel/ Mouse/ Wheel and 'Apply' any change, then it would start working.After installing the April Windows Updates, one update Failed (KB2679255). I didn't worry about it too much, thinking MS would fix it in the next Update. After installing the May Windows Updates, a second Update Failed (KB2676562). I called Toshiba Support and after a 20 minute HOLD, I spent 1 1/2 hours with the Tech on the Blue Screen/ 'wheel scroll' problem. Finally I was told that the software was NOT covered by the 1 year warranty and that I would have to pay $100 to actually fix both problems. That's just not right. I checked with MS and they say that if the MS Software was installed by the Manufacturer,(Toshiba), they support the software. I can't return it to Amazon because the 30 day Return Policy. So it would seem that my only option is to be 'Blackmailed' into paying Toshiba $100. I don't know if this is an industry policy, but Buyer Beware. This is the last Toshiba product I'll buy.....UPDATE AUGUST 1, 2012 - After waiting for more than four months MS has resolved the Failed Updates problem. So I changed my rating from a One Star to Four Star. But I wonder about the quality control of MS Updates. I still have the 'wheel scroll' issue, but can work around it. Anyway, happy now!::Mike::4.0::May 15, 2012

R3MBARHWUZLXP9::Pleased so far::I replaced a large Dell desktop with this laptop. It has more capacity in terms of hard drive, RAM, etc. It is fast, light and has been reliable and predictable in its performance. I have had several Toshiba laptops before and they were all champs from a reliability point of view.::B. Smith "Hill country"::5.0::December 26, 2011
R2ST7TOH3QE2GC::overheating::Hi, I bought Toshiba portege R835-P81. Laptop was overheating, fan working all time and noisy. Also battery time is far from 8 hours per specs (rather 3.5 hours). Faulty unit? I returned after couple of days.::michael::2.0::February 28, 2012
R2F0PAA5APSSJN::good computer; bad laptop::While this computer works very well in the sense of having terrific internals, the construction of the device leaves much to be desired.  The materials feel thin and cheap, with shiny little plastic pieces tacked on here and there.  It's reasonably light but oddly bulky and empty-feeling.  The keyboard feels a little spongy.  In the end I felt that it didn't seem mechanically robust and likely wouldn't hold up long to regular use.  I am returning it and have ordered an Acer Aspire TimelineX in its place.::Alexander Platt::2.0::January 12, 2012
RNS0PTEHIJ1YG::Poor Quality / Service - LEMON::Only gave one star because zero was not an option.  Worst laptop I have ever owned. Toshiba sent a BIOS file which resulted in a VERIFY ERROR and subsequent system failure.  I had to ship it back after owning it for less than two months at my own expense... they charged $25 for a "special shipping box" and refused to waive the fee.  BUYER BEWARE.Google: "toshiba satellite verify error bios" and see for yourself.At one time Toshiba was a quality company.  Within ten years they will be working for the Chinese.::Paul Colburn "PC"::1.0::February 15, 2012

R2ECAUP26U3CX9::Very pleased!::I purchased this laptop as a replacement for one that died.  Was a little scared to order one online but since it was after Christmas, all the stores were wiped out.  Only had the cheap ones and most expensive ones that no one wanted.  Ordered the laptop on Friday and it came on Wed.  Got the free shipping through Amazon so was happy with the speed.Laptop was neatly shipped and everything worked fine.  Had it up and running in minutes and I'm no computer genius.  Easy step by step startup.  Connected automatically to my router which I was nervous about since my son-in-law set that up for me on the old laptop.Am very happy with the speed of the laptop and haven't had any problems.  Am a big facebook gamer so I need the speed!Only reason I marked it down one star was because of the battery.  Not getting but about 3 hours off it.  Also someone mentioned the noise of the keyboard.  I did notice that it was louder than my old one, but only a problem when I'm using it at night in bed when my husband is trying to sleep.  LOL!Overall, for the price I think it's well worth it!::Linda::4.0::January 28, 2012
R1WGFBKB6YMTKB::My First Laptop::I purchased the Toshiba Satellite L755 in early December 2011. This is my first laptop. I needed it for a specific project that required portability.I am very happy with this laptop thus far.It performs well, and I have a lot of fun with it as well as working on my project. This is also my first 64 bit computer and my first using Windows 7 (which is very different from other Windows OS's)and I really appreciate the speed, versatility and detail achieved. I love the AMD quad chip set. I think it makes a difference in performance and will be getting this for my new desktop.I hadn't expected to use the wireless feature, but I do use it's convenience quite a bit with presentations, streaming movies and searches.The speakers are adequate, but a bit tinny. I hooked up an exterior set of speakers for streaming movies and will be purchasing a headset and mic combo to use with it. Streaming is a very smooth and satisfying experience. I love that I don't have to purchase and install additional software to watch a DVD, unlike my HP desktop PC, which has a DVD Player and NO Installed Software.My primary problem is the screen seems to scratch easily around the edges; I think from coming into contact with the base when closed. I live in a very dusty, static filled climate. I've been looking for a soft screen protector that I can use on this laptop screen, much like the screen protector I have for my digital camera.The battery life has not been good for me...about 2 hours. But it does charge quickly (about 20 minutes)and my meetings are never long enough to drain the battery. Being unused to laptop batteries, I may not have treated it properly when I began using the machine.The Chassis stays pretty cool and that is a relief. I sometimes use a portable laptop desk with it, but that never seems to get more than a bit warm.I've never cared for the keyboards on laptops so I purchased the Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse Logitech Wireless Desktop MK320 KeyboardLogitech Wireless Mouse M505 (Black) (for use on my PC and laptop) and an extra wireless mouse just for the laptop. These work fine. I also purchased a Display Link USB 2.0 plugable docking station because I wanted to be able to use the Laptop with my DSL hookup and my new ViewSonic 24" monitor (love this)and a printer, but so far I have not been able to get the docking station to work with the Laptop and DSL. It's probably my ignorance at work here.The Toshiba doesn't get hard use or a lot of banging around, so I can't speak to it's toughness. I do have a zippered soft case for it to try to keep the dust down and protect the surfaces.All in all, this was a great buy and I am very happy with my purchase.For folks new to Windows 7 (I started with DOS) I urge you to get a good non-technical manual. I'll be reviewing two of those soon.::Spud's Place "Parnassus in the Desert"::4.0::January 22, 2012
R2E357U586QGVA::More Than Pleased With This::We've always bought expensive computers and was weary about buying something so cheap.  But this thing is awesome! It is replacing a 6 year old Toshiba Lap top that was $1,800 and after this, I'll never pay those prices again.  It's used for basics, Itunes, surfing, photo's, a few letters.  It is soooo much faster, the speakers are really good, lots of memory.  I like how you can touch the sensor and swipe your fingers to make the screen bigger or smaller, and charge the iphone while the computer is in sleep mode.  It's quick to start up or shut down, and key board is pretty nice.  I'm more than made up with this computer.::Jacqueline De Lap::5.0::January 1, 2012
RLGIZM972ZNMY::Good laptop for the price!::I'd gotten this Laptop on my Birthday, it is a good looking unit sharp finish silver housing. one thing is that it has too much pre-loaded software, which I had to pay the Geeks ... $50 to remove them all. Beside that, I am happy with the Laptop. Toshiba has always been a good brand in our home.::Morris::4.0::December 21, 2011
R3ME3VCQ5KP3OG::Seems like a good deal::I purchased this laptop during a Black Friday lightning deal.  I've seen similar Toshiba laptops with smaller hard drives and fewer features in the ads.  So far, so good.  It works as advertised.  I would warn people about holding the laptop at the hinge when carrying it.  The center is not very well supported so the monitor presses in when holding it.  I'm not sure if this is healthy for the monitor, so I try to avoid carrying it this way.  If you are careful and carry it in a laptop case then you are probably fine.  Won't be to sturdy if dropped though.::Jeff S.::4.0::December 19, 2011
R2W4NEOFUPB357::Excellent::This equipment complies with all requirements expected in multimedia, is lightweight, excellent picture quality, very fast, quiet, does not overheat, long battery life. just meet my expectations::celestemax::5.0::December 12, 2011
R2RLGNQ6G32HWE::Good Buy!::I bought this Toshiba a few weeks ago. Got one of those black Friday deals. I am very happy with this machine. It performs well for the tasks I use it for (the I3 processor has more guts than my old Pentium). I am a newbie to Windows 7, but I like it so far. I generally use the Toshiba as a desk-top - with a larger monitor and wireless keyboard and mouse, although when I do use it as a laptop the screen is fine, and the touch pad is easy to use. My photo editing software has no problems running (which is one of the reasons I wanted to upgrade, the old Pentium and slower hard drive was having some issues with Photoshop Elements). I would definitely recommend this laptop.::K. Wagner::4.0::December 11, 2011
R1A3R6T73C16EJ::Lap Top Excellance::All the positive feedback was right on the money, after years of being an HP fan and having some bad experinces I was looking for a simple alternative that was not to expensive but strong enough to do the everyday chores a typical Lap Top would preform. In my opinion this one fits the bill, love the thing.::Gary::5.0::January 8, 2012

R1F85YG1Q0MLUB::not bad~::The laptop has a really large screen, and the keyboard is also great. But, the touch pad is kind of sticky, making me feel weird. All in all, not bad for a 399$ laptop.::Jacob::4.0::December 26, 2011
R1H5BYPEFBAEKK::Satisfied::This review is not techy nor full of hardware information; for that there are other great reviews on Amazon. The Satellite was easy to set up right out of the box and it works perfectly. The screen is bright and clear; it was a little too bright but it was easy to adjust. The "chicklet" keys are different than our old Dell Inspiron but they feel comfortable and respond well to the typing. I expected the touchpad to be a problem when I type but I haven't had any issues. There is a easily accessible button that will turn the touchpad off if it does become a problem. The laptop is exactly what I wanted for our home and I look forward to enjoying it.::David::5.0::December 25, 2011

It is LIGHTWEIGHT, beautiful, fast, and so far flawless.  The screen is the perfect size for sitting in front of the TV and surfing the web.  Mouse control is great.

R2UIBGEIZS83UX::Great buy::Bought this laptop Jan 2012 to replace my 3.5-year-old HP whose motherboard died. So far it's worked great, not a single crash. The dual-core i3 actually gives faster, more responsive performance than my work laptop with a dual-core i5. Graphics is fine for light gaming. Battery life consistently 4-5 hours under reasonable use. The must-have feature for me is the dedicated numeric keypad. All in all, very happy with the quality and reliability of this product for a very reasonable price.::TJ Andreas::5.0::July 27, 2012

My HP notebook and desktop pc burnt out within a few years, and every Dell computer I've had eventually runs slow. However, I have had no problem with Toshiba. Just a word of advice... get a notebook, not a netbook. I wasn't quite as impressed with the Toshiba netbook I got, but the Satellite laptops are the best.::JoyUS::5.0::March 23, 2012

I bought 1 of the L755 series right after Christmas and within a couple of weeks keys started popping off the keyboard, the alt key gets stuck and you have to bang on it 3-4 times before you can type.  I was a totally satisfied Toshiba user for a long time...no more.::nolatodd::1.0::March 21, 2012
RKEFH7QRNZ8XV::Excelent::This is my first Toshiba Laptop, and for the price it's excelent!It was very fast to set this computer up, connecting to the wireless network and getting online took less than 10 minutes. The keyboard is full sized with nice key action. The screen is big, bright and really sharp. Love it.It has very cool things- A button to desactivate the track pad when using an external mouse- an HDMI port- is light enough for its size- even when the computer is asleep, you can charge your toys like ipad, phone... THIS IS THE BEST!- there is a media card reader slot for a camera media carddrawbacks- the Track pad has a touch feature for expanding and contracting your internet browser, sometimes this can be a headache, cause while you're using it, frequently make the mistakes of expanding or contracting your browser and is a chaos.. but sometimes it can be a easy way to do it. Is the only thing that I don't like very much.But in general is an excelent computer..::pats::5.0::March 12, 2012

R6L3TFPLHKBOR::So far, So good::Purchased this laptop for college. I needed something simple. I've had it for a few days and so far everything is good. The keyboard is great. Being an accounting major, I really like having the full keyboard and it's not hard to type on. I have a few big fingers due to injuries in the past and I can easily type on the keyboard without any issues.The webcam is decent and the microphone is as well. I really like how I can turn off the mouse pad and use a separate mouse. It's not too heavy, although, if you are also carrying books with the laptop, it will become an issue. The battery life is okay, not great, but its decent and it works for me. Also, It doesn't get too hot. My old Gateway used to get super hot within two hours of use, I've used it almost 3hrs already and it's not even warm.I have to go do some homework so, I'll update this review in the future if anything goes wrong.[Edit: 3/15/2013]I've had this laptop for over a year now. After the first 6 months, it started acting up. Now mind you, I do weekly cleaning, virus scanning, etc. My professor has had to help me troubleshoot what the heck is going on more than once. I'm thankful that I am smart enough to my data on an external drive. Knowing what I know now, I'd of never purchased this laptop.::Jennifer::2.0::January 14, 2012
R29WXD8LIBQSFS::NICE!::I bought this on an Amazon Lightning Deal during the Black Friday weekend for my wife for Christmas.  We had an old IBM Thinkpad that she was using in the kitchen to check email and surf the net but it finally died of old age this past year.  This laptop has worked great right out of the box and we have so far had no issues to report.  The battery life doesn't seem to be that great but it might just be due to the Wi-Fi always being on or something.  As noted elsewhere, the hard drive capacity isn't as large as advertised and I don't think it's a formatting thing.  I think someone goofed up on the specs.  The Wi-Fi is nice and strong and has no problems pulling in a strong signal where our of IBM with USB based wifi was always losing the signal or forever had weak levels.  I upgraded Norton through Comcast for free and installed a full Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus package that my employer was offering for $9.95, so she has full versions of the basics (AV, Outlook, Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint, Publisher, etc) installed for very little money out of pocket.  I'll update if we encounter any issues.EDIT:  04/09/12 -- We've had no issues to report.  I've updated the BIOS twice now and have not had an issue with either of the updates (currently on v3.10).  I am not sure where the fail point is on the BIOS installs, but both of mine have run through nice and smooth -- I just followed the install instructions.::Yllabian Space Guppy::5.0::January 10, 2012
RR3SM8YHR9DAA::Good product-Great Price-No Problems::Purchased late November.  Received item promptly.  I've had no problems with the item.  Nice quality display and sound.  I do not game or do other intensive tasks with the laptop.  So far it has performed well.  It does come with pre-installed applications from toshiba that should be removed.  Wish they did not install the items.  Keys not backlit. Wireless networking easy to set up.  No problems.  It is not heavy.  the touchpad is rather sensitive and adjusting the settings does not appear to help. Has full number keypad which is a big plus.  For the money 399.00 with no shipping or taxes it is a great laptop.::powderhorn::4.0::January 4, 2012

R2HV9CR2JAX4BW::laptop computer::I had not bought a new computer in about 10 years, so I was a little nervous buying on-line.  This computer was pretty easy to set-up and get going.  I got it at about 4 pm and I needed it for a show that I was going to do at 600, so I was able to quickly install the software and import the files from my old computer to new one in about 30 min. User friendly and quick.  I was a little disappointed it did not come with any software as my previous computers had. But I was able to download what I needed with software I had purchased, but it's nice to get updated software with new computers.  I had a little trouble with the Windows Lived Mail and spent several hours trying to get it to work and sent a question into Microsoft and got it fixed myself before they emailed me a response back 2 weeks later, but this was nothing to do with Toshiba, it's software. It would be nice if the keyboard was back lit, but not too bothersome. Overall it is quick and easy to use for my needs.::Melissa::4.0::December 31, 2011

The battery dies almost every hour when fully charged and never gives a correct estimate of the battery life.

It was in trying ti return this laptop that i was exposed to the horrible customer service from Amazon, as they were the sellers...Amazon's support service leaves a lot to be desired as I tried (and I'm still trying...) to return the laptop i was left with unhelpful feedback and unanswered questions.I truly regret the day i decided on purchasing this, since it was the cause of unnecessary stress...I will NEVER buy any item with Amazon as the seller. I don't know if there was any discrimination since I left the US with the laptop and had to ship it from Trinidad in the West Indies or not...But there is one thing i can say about my experience with this product....AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKSI am still waiting for someone to help...::Safiyyah::1.0::January 30, 2012

I use google chrome for internet, and it worked fine the 1st 2 days.  Then I started to install and transfer some basic software & files to this laptop and planned to use it as my work computer. But I don't know what happened - The internet start to crash every time I want to use it, with both google chrome and internet explorer. I checked and did all updates available, and restarted computer again and again. Yet it is still happening. I really want to like this computer - I mean I got it at $399, and Toshiba is a well established Japanese brand. But I don't know what to do now. Have this happened to anyone else? or if any one has any idea about this issue? Thanks :)::grace::2.0::December 6, 2011

If you read the specs from Toshiba it says battery life is UP TO 6.38 hours.  Iam tired of companys lying to the public with false statements to sell there product. At a full charge the most I get out of my battery is 3 hours. After 10 min of non-use it drops down to 1 hour 55 min. If the battery gets 3 hours say 3 hours not 6.38 hours. Toshiba is misleading the public, if I new I would only get 3 hours I would have never purchased the unit. They say that so you would buy there product. I talked to Toshiba and they would not do anything for me, so BUYERS BEWARE....::JR "Wambat"::3.0::February 11, 2012
RC4TAIRST7D9I::Decent Cheap Notebook::My primary computer is a Macbook, and I was looking for an inexpensive Windows notebook that would do the few things a Mac doesn't do well. I bought this on Black Friday, and for the money, it has as good an assortment of features like an HDMI port, and a 640 GB HDD.  The touchpad has a slightly rough texture that I like because it is quite different from the feel of the rest of the case.  The biggest downside of this machine is said case, it's just plain ugly; the shiny silver finish looks and feels cheap.  The top of the lid flexes when you push on it, and creaks a little bit. This isn't a huge problem for me; I'm not going to carry it around.  If you do, just know that you won't be the coolest in the coffee shop.  I like the fact that it has a number pad, but it takes a little getting used to where the keys are if you are used to a notebook that doesn't have one.  The processor, memory, display, etc are adequate for web surfing, word processing and the like, and pretty standard for notebooks in this price point.  When you get it, the first thing you'll need to do is delete all of the useless bloatware Toshiba loads on their computers.  All in all, it's not a bad low end basic computer.::Henry Spencer::3.0::December 26, 2011
R3W3WVTKTL9RHL::Caution::I purchased the L755 series/S5349 on JAN.26,2012 from Amazon. Right out of the box it ran extremely slow,I have an 8 year old Toshiba laptop that is 10 times faster than this new laptop,very unhappy with its' speed and the extreme garbage it has installed in it, I am reluctant to contact Toshiba due to their inability to care for the customer and my inability to understand their english ,,I saved my money thinking this toshiba would be great,but I am now stuck with a dead horse so it seems!! So new customers beware of Toshiba and the poor quality item it has. Also check other review sites before you buy Toshiba.::stump::1.0::February 16, 2012
R179N38YT8O6XD::Very happy with purchase::We are very happy with this purchase.  I'd consider it a budget style laptop but it has worked great.  The load times from startup or supsended sleep are very fast.  Have not had any issues with hardware since we purchased it as our daily user.  We use it for internet, video/picture storing and viewing, and word processing mainly.  Certainly powerful enough to do all of those things very easily.::Dukenilnil::5.0::August 28, 2012
R3G1MNLGDIBSC8::Tiny keys and fitful mousepad::If you are a touch typist with adult fingers, you will find both keyboard and mousepad very disappointing.Both features are presented in smooth plastic.  The keys are not concave and are very small.  The mousepad is only slightly rougher than the overall surface.  Owning to this poor quality, a good typist (and I am a good one -- 120 WPM) makes many 'mistakes.'What is worse, the mousepad supports squeezing and scrolling and is hypersensitive to these.  You cannot turn these features off, even if the control claims you can.  So, the cursor flies all over the screen and images fades to unreadable, then to oversize, with no control.Otherwise, the laptop actually works.::Peter S. Oliphant, Ph.D.::2.0::March 14, 2012

R1XMSZ7XCB4Y4Z::not bad, but not real good either::The interface selection is decent, Dell didn't cut corners here, even though more than just 3 USB ports would be nice.For ~$600, an i3 was ok in Summer, but with the Year drawing to its end and Intel's new Ivy Bridge CPU's showing up in a couple of months, it would have been nice if a discounted i5 with its HD3000 could have made it into this model.There's no dedicated GPU at all, so you're stuck with the i3's anemic integrated graphics... e[...]As for the screen, I find the 1366x768 pixel resolution poor, no matter what fancy names they give it.  But Dell isn't alone with this, everything from 11" to 15" comes with this atrocious resolution these days.To me, this resolution would be effective in an entry level gaming machine with a lower mid-range GPU like the HD6630M or GT540M, since those GPUs do a lot better with low resolutions.This notebook however has no GPU, so you won't be playing any games with it - leaving it for people who only do office work and maybe watch an occasional video.  For office work, 1366x768 is extremely poor, especially if you're stuck with Microsoft's latest version of Office with those big ribbons...  there is very little screen space left for Excel and Word to display what you're actually trying to work on.  You can forget about legibly displaying a whole page of a document.  In Excel, you'll be in a hell of scrolling-up-and-down-and-back-and-forth.So, I consider this display a mismatch for the only role this laptop can fulfill. (if you want nothing more than browse the web, you could of course buy a much lighter weight netbook, or, god forbid, a tablet)Lastly, its not exactly light weight for the screen size, there are 15.6" notebooks that weigh less.You are probably able to configure this model differently on Dell's website, but there can be drastic price differences in either direction, even for a unit with identical spec, cause Dell's own quoted prices never include tax, so on Dells site your bill jumps when you reach checkout, on Amazon it doesn't. At other times, Dell may have cut its prices, while the sales channel is still full of product with the old price.  So do yourself a favor and double check  :)::niels::3.0::November 10, 2011

R1RYOK005MAC4I::Cannot replace battery with non-OEM battery!!!::Dell needs to get their act together. A lot of their laptops no longer work with non-OEM batteries, meaning that when your battery no longer holds a charge (usually happens in a year or two, depending on your use), you have to shell out a hell of a lot of money to buy an original Dell battery. You won't be able to use a non-OEM battery (which would be much cheaper). You will get this error message if you try to use a non-Dell battery in a Dell laptop:"the model number for the primary battery cannot be determined. This will prevent any battery present from charging. Please insert a Dell battery for best system operation."I'm never going to buy another Dell laptop. This is a deal-breaker for me.::medz::1.0::May 15, 2012

I admit, I am a dinosaur when it comes to computers and most other modern devices. But, I can only stand so much of freezing up, the cursor going where IT wanted to go, etc. Plus, the windows 7 home edition leaves you wondering whether it is even working most of the time. There is no icon to show that the thing is searching, etc. I have owned several computers in the past, but this is the worst one that I have ever owned.

Replacement was to be for family use primarily, with basic applications such as word processing, banking, shopping, browsing etc. So far, I have had no complaints.The I3 processor is quick enough for my needs, the system boots up very quickly (about 20 seconds or so - a far cry from the Toshiba), and I've had no crashes or freezes so far. Build quality could have been a bit better....this Dell feels....well, delicate. You don't feel like it can take any sort of abuse...which is not a real issue with me because it remains on my dining room table anyway. Dedicated numeric keypad is a definite plus, along with USB 3.0 connectivity, Bluetooth and WIDI. Overall, a competent and capable family laptop,::kevin::4.0::December 21, 2011
R2Y9240PMJA5LU::Laptop harddrive crash::This laptop was purchased for my child and worked well.  After 7 months the hard drive crashed and couldn't be booted.  A call to support - took awhile after being shuffled around - determined that the drive needed to be replaced.  A box was to be mailed to send computer back to company.  After a week and no box I called again.  They told me that no box was sent and they could send a box (after I went through the entire set of problems again) but it would take 4-6 weeks to get the computer back.  For $40 I could have someone come out to the house and fix it in 2 days.  I bit the bullet and the tech came out and fixed it.  He was quick and the computer came back to life after decompressing (2 hours).  Of course everything was lost on the computer and we had to start all over - loading itunes and every other piece of software.  Lost all documents, mail, etc.  Do those backups - your computer may fail 6 months in and not 3 years in.BTW - my other child has a Dell also (3 years older) and it started getting really hot and shutting down.  While the tech was here I mentioned that to him and he suggested we pull the cover off and see if lint was collecting near the fan and heatsink.  He was right on - pulled a little hairy mouse ball out and the computer works like a charm.  Remember to get that compound/paste for the heat-sink if you remove it.::AFI::3.0::June 6, 2012
RKPUN8VGTUDPR::Good laptop for the price::I bought this laptop from Dell direct a little while ago. I am quite pleased with it. This is my third laptop, the first Dell laptop, although I have bought many Dell desktops over the past 10 years, both for personal use and for the company I worked for. I have never been disappointed with Dell quality and this is no exception thus far. I had an issue because I was promised a complimentary 15 month subscription for McAfee as part of the package, but when I activated McAfee, they only activated it as a trial version for 3 months. Sent an email to Dell support and their response was immediate and effective. McAfee was activated for 15 months in a matter of hours.I don't understand why people gripe about the keyboard. I have no issues with it. I even had to remove it to bump the memory up to 8GB and everything kept working just fine when I replaced it. The only criticism I have is the fact that the indicator LEDs are on the side of the unit, out of sight of the user. This was a stupid design decision by Dell.The machine has all the horsepower I need for my work (mostly software development). I don't use it for games - my machines work for a living, they are not toys. You cannot reasonably expect better performance at this price. If you want better performance, expect to pay more.I will buy it again if it ever became necessary.::Cornelius B. Henning "Neels Henning"::5.0::February 8, 2012

This does not seem likely since a SSD drive is supposed to work in the same configuration as a hard drive. Maybe a firmware update is needed.I took this apart so I know this laptop a little better than most.  I had to do this to upgrade, or try, the hard drive to a SSD drive.Runs fine for the most part, but have concerns of build quality and durability and the design flaw to replace the hard drive.***Updated my review***I had quite a few issues with the Dell support and customer service. However, after getting through to the US Customer service I was able to get my restocking fee waived. So I moved this up a notch.EDIT AGAIN!Dell Customer service is a joke.  If you have any problems don't expect Dell to step up.  I was called saying they were going to refund my restocking fee, however they didn't.  I called them to ask when this would be credited back and they said they didn't have any notes on this and I would not get the restocking fee waived.The first time I called to get the SSD drive assistance I was tranferred to 5 different departments, most of them incorrect.  Then when I want to return the laptop, they transferred me to about 4 more departments, 2 incorrectly.  I spend about 1.5 hours on that ridiculous call.Now they are saying their customer service didn't call me to waive the restocking fee, even though I have the voicemail still.  They aren't replying to my emails now about this.  WHAT A JOKE DELL CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!::W. Moore::2.0::December 16, 2011
RWN49H3CZIDI2::Solid choice::Aesthetically, it's clean and plain with a boxy, modern feel. In the photo, the lid looks like brushed aluminum, but in person it's smooth, shiny plastic with a brushed look. I love the chiclet keyboard -- it types with a slightly clicky, satisfying motion, very quiet with a bit more grippy finger-feel than a Mac keyboard. The touchpad is just slightly rough and the buttons feel sturdy. It's heavier and chunkier than a typical Toshiba or HP model of this class (typical of Dell), but still portable enough that I feel perfectly comfortable walking around with it.The sound quality is fairly good, although I'm not sure why Dell put the speakers on the bottom. They're right in the front where the base slopes up, so they're somewhat pointed toward me, but the sound is a little muffled when I put it on my lap instead of on a hard, flat surface. It's somewhat easy to accidentally press the button that pops open the CD tray while carrying it. The screen is shiny and bright, and the webcam image is reasonably clear, even in dim light. The microphone sound quality is clean -- I don't hear any hiss or buzz -- and it picks up just fine from a couple of feet away.Predictably comes with useless pre-installed Dell utilities that you'll probably want to remove. I don't really feel the need to comment on its performance -- the specs on this one are fairly common, so you should be able to do your own research on the hardware.::Andrew Triska::5.0::November 27, 2011
R16QWSADQ4KNO8::Grue::I normaly don't do reviews but for this item i must. I read all the reviews for the Dell and on the advise of the computor Geek that services the computers at work boughr one. I have none of the issues mentioned in the bad reviews, it runs cool, so quiet you foget its on, fast, and with several items up at the same time the ram is only running 35% and the unit still runs lightnig fast. I use my laptop as if it was a tower, I use a wireless mouse & key pad and a 23" monitor, the laptop sits closed in the corner of my desk, if I could find a way to start it without opening the lid I would probably never open it. If your looking for a compact power house and don't need a large screen or the 10 key option, this would be a good choice. I would recomend this to a friend.::Steve Richards::5.0::January 2, 2012
RLLETYZVR4PZI::New laptop is fast and stable::Laptop is replacement for 2006 XP.  So far, it is great.  Boots fast, is stable, and maintains wireless connection.  I do not like the add-on software that came with it, though (antivirus, cloud backups, etc. with) which persistently pop up and are "in your face" more now than ever urging you to sign up or buy.  I paid for the laptop and that's all I want and I will shop for whatever I want when I want to. I don't appreciate Dell being sneeky about the hype.  I got a good price through an Amazon vendor and fast, predictable delivery when promised.

R20OYBM2PD6WYC::Hard drive not replaceable !!!::I purchased a Dell Inspiron i14RN-1818DBK at a brick and mortar store then when I went online to dell's website I found that you had to virtually remove every screw in the thing and pry the keyboard off in order to upgrade the hard drive, or replace it if it went south.  That alone caused me to return it without even plugging it in and turning it on.  I always like to replace the slow 5400-rpm hard drives with faster ones even if it does cost me a bit in battery life.  That way if the faster drive I select does go south I still have the original one that I can clone again.  When manufactures make replacing hard drives and ram really difficult for me I simply vote with my pocketbook.  I just purchased a Toshiba P745-S4320 at another brick and mortar for almost $100 more. It has 1 less usb port, no e-SATA or bluetooth, but does have a blue ray player and most importantly the ram and hard drive are accessible.::Songdog::1.0::October 30, 2011
R14DPPTS7NLOEM::Initial thoughts::Just received mine and finished going through setup.  Not too much crapware installed.  Nice option during setup to set partition sizes.Out of the box Windows Experience Index: 5.9.Processor: 7.5RAM: 7.6Graphics: 6.1Gaming Graphics: 6.1Hard disk: 5.9I wish the arrow keys were a bit larger - maybe 3/4 size (if not full size) instead of the 1/2 size that they are (on the other hand, I need to remember that the numeric keypad does double duty with full size navigation keys).  I would have preferred to have power connection in the rear rather than the side.Update Dec 13: The wifi antenna is giving me noticeably worse performance than my previous laptop.  Working from the same chair, my 5 year old Dell D620 was getting link speeds of 36-48Mbps.  This laptop is getting 5-18Mbps.  Loss of 1 star.Update Dec 14: There's no BREAK key on the keyboard!  This forces you to use the mouse to enter/leave full screen remote desktop (instead of ctrl+alt+break).  No ctrl+break either. The touchpad is taking some getting used to.  It produces an audible click, but the force required to produce the audible is less than the force required for a mouse click to actually register with the OS - need to see if that can be adjusted.  The display has an ambient light sensor near the delete/home/end/page-up/page-down keys.  Using those keys causes the display to dim.  Disable the sensor via the easy settings apps.Figured out the problem with the touchpad. It has a deadzone that is about 3/4" inch long by 1/2" tall.  The deadzone is located on the left half of the bottom edge.  The right-half works fine for right-click.  Left-click is a bad experience. No clicks are ever registered in that zone even though the pad does make an audible click.The external power supply isn't too large.  But it makes a heck of a lot of noise even though it is on the floor underneath a table.  I thought I was hearing clicking of disk drive head movement.  Nope, the power supply makes a staticy-clicking sound whenever I alt+tab between windows.  That sound is also made when using arrows keys to move up and down lists or when using the mouse to reposition scrollbars.The bottom of the laptop is very smooth/slick.  Keeps sliding around on my legs and requires that I apply downward force with my palms.  I'll need to put some textured tape on the bottom.Starting to regret this purchase...Update Dec 15:  The deadzone on the touchpad is getting smaller.  But the lower right corner of the touchpad feels like it has gotten a flat tire.  It is now noticeably lower than the rest of the touchpad and right-clicks are more difficult there as there is almost no travel left for clicks.I now understand what the other reviewer wrote about jumpy cursor.  The problem is due to the deadzone.  When I do full left-right sweeps on the touchpad, it is very responsive except over the deadzone.  Then the cursor hiccups - it doesn't jump, it just stops moving, then starts moving again when my finger makes it to the other side of the deadzone.I really want to like this machine (all the features are there and the form-factor is fantastic - 1600x900 in a small 15 inches), but the wifi performance and touchpad durability/performance are killing it for me.  Maybe this will also turn into a review of Samsung repair service.Got AutoHotKey to map CapsLock to Break.  Search for the "How to add a Pause/Break key to a keyboard that doesn't have one?" question at superuser com.At every new user session, there are like 4 or 5 samsung apps (battery, easy settings, harddisk, ...) that require UAC elevation when you login if using a standard Windows account.  Administrative accounts are only prompted 2 or 3 times.  All of these apps are scheduled tasks that are triggered by login.And the wifi performance still stinks.Update Dec 17:  I like the display and hardware (other than the wifi and the busted touchpad).  I'll buy a new router to see if wifi performance improves.  The touchpad will need repair, but I don't want to part with it quite yet.  The dmhkcore.exe app that provides oem fn key functionality does not work properly with standard user accounts.  It needs to be terminated and then restarted with admin privileges in order for fn+(f1, f2, f3 or f12) to work correctly (the other fn key combinations do work without admin privileges).Update Dec 20:  I got a new Netgear WNDR4000 dual-band N router (the old Linksys router did G).  Wifi link speed improved but is still on average lower than my old laptop from my working position (read that as: the N performance of my new laptop is slightly lower than the G performance of my old laptop).  If I move about 12 feet closer to the router, then I start to see what N is really about.Update Dec 21: I checked out the B model that was on display at Best Buy.  The touchpad is the same but that one did not have the deadzone that mine has.  It does have a similar flat-tire right-click area.Update Jan 6: check out the samsung forum over at notebookreview dot com.Update Jan 18: This laptop does not support OpenGL running on the AMD graphics card.  See the forum over at notebookreview. /samsung/630666-series-7-chronos-all-:models-push-samsung-implement-fixed-mode-bios-23.html#post8247924 and /samsung/630666-series-7-chronos-all-models-push-samsung-implement-fixed-mode-bios-23.html#post8248124Update Feb 17: OpenGL issue is resolved with just released drivers.  I removed the 4GB stick and replaced with 8GB - now I have a total of 12GB.  Nice.::Sean::4.0::December 12, 2011
R3OPSF80OHK2DX::15" Samsung Series 7 Laptop - Poor Wi-Fi performance - NOT THIS ONE!::Our biggest concern before buying this Samsung Series 7 laptop was the horror stories relating to poor Wi-Fi performance for units equipped with the Broadcom Wi-Fi card.But a family member wanted it and asked me to set it up. I have now had a chance to use it for the last 6 weeks.Fortunately Wi-Fi turned out to be OK (details below).This laptop is fast, quiet and runs cool. The matte anti-glare display is very pleasing and bright.It is a pleasure to use, the backlit keyboard is a must, no more fumbling in the dark.It's also great that it is equipped with a full size HDMI port for connecting to a TV etc. By the way, it switches automatically to the dedicated AMD Radeon HD 6750M graphics board when plugging into the HDMI.Two of the three USB ports are USB 3.0 (great for fast data transfer to external drives)It has a very large TrackPad which obeys somewhat similar hand-gestures you may have become used to from smart phone displays. I am a mouse fan and turn the pad off because my thumbs rest on it when I type making the cursor jump all over.This Series 7 SO3US model comes with Win 7 Pro and a factory recovery disk that allows you to do a clean install (nice touch and almost unheard of these days).The -SO3US model may be the best value as compared to the other models -S0AUS, -S0BUS, -S04US, -S09US etc. because the S03 comes with the maximum 8GB RAM, 1GB of dedicated graphics memory and Win 7 Professional already installed (although one of the other models has 1TB HDD).It has 8 GB of RAM and a 750 GB 7200 RPM HDD.This Series 7 is faster than a typical PC equipped with HDD (Hard Disk Drive) because Samsung equipped the motherboard with an 8GB SSD (Solid State Drive) used for faster execution of programs and boot-up (as compared to a PC with HDD only).The optical drive loads the DVD automatically when partly inserted into the slot (similar to a Mac). Push Fn and Delete simultaneously to eject (not mentioned in the Quick Start instructions).I personally prefer the old fashioned mechanical tray-loader with a push button for opening.  The disadvantage of the slot loader type is that it may not accept the small diameter CDs often containing drivers for accessories (I did not dare try).But I guess it is a matter of preference because you may prefer to download drivers from the manufacturer(s) website which will ensure that you always get the latest/updated version.WI-FI PERFORMANCEAs mentioned our biggest concern before buying was the horror stories relating to poor Wi-Fi performance of Samsung Series 7 laptops equipped with the Broadcom Wi-Fi card.The first thing I did after opening the box was to test the Wi-Fi signal strength using inSSDer 2.1 (free software). A great tool, it will show you all the routers in your area including signal strength (and much more).My hart almost stopped when comparing the 15" Series 7 with my own 17" Samsung RF711 S03US.I could only see 3 routers on the 15" Series 7 whereas I could see at least 16 routers on the 17".  Also the signal intensity measured in dB (decibel) was significantly stronger on the 17" (a smaller negative number indicates higher signal strength = closer to zero).Any difference is significant as 3 dB increase represent a DOUBLING in strength.I was ready to pack it up and send it back but decided to put it to the test using "LAN Speed Test" a highly effective program to map and troubleshoot transfer speeds in your network.To my surprise the 15" with the Broadcom Wi-Fi board did better over "long" distances compared to the 17" with the Intel Wi-Fi board. As you will notice the 17" did better at short distances where the speed was 1.5 to 2 times higher but "relatively poorly" at longer distances.In my opinion the 15" Samsung Series 7 with the Broadcom Wi-Fi card came out as the winner in these tests.YOU CAN CLICK ON COMMENTS BELOW THIS REVIEW TO SEE THE ACTUAL TEST RESULTS.SSD UPGRADEThe computer was fast in the factory configuration however if you desire EXTREME SPEED or longer battery life you can replace the original HDD with a SSD.This is exactly what we did to this laptop and boy it's fast!To find out how it's done click on this link .... Samsung 830 - Series MZ-7PC512N/AM 512 GB 2.5 Inch SATA III MLC Internal SSD Laptop Kit with Norton Ghost 15 and search in the reviews for the heading: "NEED FOR SPEED! You got it... and without losing the factory F4 recovery option. HERE IS HOW!"WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP TO A FRIEND?Absolutely, the factory configuration and performance is excellent. It is very thin, light and  perfect for travel.Only users that need to manipulate large graphics/video files or perhaps have been "spoiled" by SSD systems may want to consider a SSD upgrade. (This category will also want their computers connected via a wired network).Some early versions of the Series 7 laptops that hit the market may have Wi-Fi issues (as reported in some early reviews and complaints all over the internet) however if you have problems, the first thing to do would be to verify that you have the latest drivers (I have added the Driver details and HOW TO DO THE TEST as a comment below this review).Before this purchase, we compared a lot of different laptops and eventually ended up with this one over the Sony Series S VAIO laptop. The Sonys (in the store) were running so hot that the back was unpleasant to the touch.A couple of important pointsThis 7 Series is up and running in TWO SECONDS from sleep mode and a reboot takes 22 seconds.You only reboot once a week when you use the Fast Start feature (it will ask you once a week).Also the backlit keyboard is fast and pleasant.I hope this review can bring some facts to the table regarding the ongoing Intel/Broadcom Wi-Fi discussion and also help you find the right laptop.::Internet shopper "Retired but not tired!"::5.0::March 22, 2012
R17FOK6U43WIPP::Amazing laptop but has its flaws::I've used Desktop PCs for as long as I could remember and this is the first laptop I've ever purchased. However I did tons of research before I purchased this machine. So as a new laptop user, I just want to say I'm pleased I made the change to mobile computing.The laptop has a lot pros, but it also has some cons that really stand out. The hardware itself is solid. Aluminum build with a clean brushed look on top. The keyboard is very easy to type on, but the edge of the laptop is sharp and it digs into your wrist while your typing. It's more than a minor annoyance. You'll find yourself lifting your wrist off (mainly your right wrist) to see the marks the edge leaves behind. I'm not going to lie, the edge is sharp enough to put in some pain. I suggest wearing a wrist band while typing.Another issue that bugged me a little bit was the video graphics. If you don't optimize the graphics to play videos off the web, such as Facebook videos, the video itself will get scrambled. It will continue to play, as you'll still hear the audio, but the video will be glitched. And it just won't happen once. It will continue to happen until you go into the Catalyst Control Center and deal with the issue.Seeing that I'm coming from a desktop PC, I really don't have much to compare the battery life to. But from using the computer for over 6 hours continuously, with WiFi on, I can say that it's sufficient enough to get you through a full day's worth of work.The backlit keyboard is beautiful, and the display is straight up gorgeous. The "max screen" technology they added to the display really helps it stand out among other laptops. The viewing angles, however could have been a little better.For the price of the laptop, I wish a BluRay player added instead of a DVD writer. But in the end, you'll be trading the BluRay for the newest i7 quad core processor, and a top the line graphics card. So in my opinion it evens out. Besides, who uses physical discs for anything anymore? :PI haven't played any games on this yet so I really can't say much about the graphics itself.ProsBacklit keyboardFast start up from cold start or sleepSleek lookNumPadSlot load Disc Drive instead of Tray LoadLong Battery LifeConsEdge of laptop digs into wrist, leaving marksGraphics aren't set up out of the boxNo BluRay DriveJumpy mouseI would Recommend this item to others.::hbaig1206::4.0::December 6, 2011
REKIWO0DMMXMA::Overall fantastic with some reservations::There is a common issue with the space key on this laptop in that pressing it on the edge will often not register even if you press really hard. This is incredibly irritating for a touch typist, but today I solved the problem on my laptop! So if you have the same issue see my video on the quick fix over at [...]. Basically you just need to stick a square of paper between the space bar and its pressure sensor.Also note that this S03US version is functionally exactly the same as the S01US version, with the only difference being that the first 4GB of RAM is permanently attached to the motherboard on the S03US.  The S02US and S04US are likewise functionally identical. The Best Buy version (I don't know the product code) is completely different though. I have no idea why anyone would buy that one.Among the positives for this laptop are its speedy CPU and GPU, readable resolution on the bright non-reflective 15" display, light weight, stylish form factor, really superb battery life, a great backlit keyboard (once the space key problem is resolved), and a good amount of RAM and hard drive storage.Because the positives are so great I am giving this laptop 5 stars even though it has several negatives.First, the space key issue.  This is a quality control issue that should have never occurred, and I hope Samsung will send new space bar keys to all the people who bought this laptop. But until then, you can try the quick fix I referenced above.The choice of DVD instead of blu-ray is odd and perplexing. However, I so rarely use even the DVD and to be honest I would probably never use blu-ray if it were included, so as strange as it is that the feature is missing, I don't mind.I am not pleased with the choice of the broadcom wifi, which does not support 5ghz wifi.  I have opened up this laptop, which is very easy (close the LCD, flip it over, remove the ten screws on bottom, then flip it back over, open the LCD and gently pry the case shell loose along the edges and then close the LCD and flip it over again and gently pull the bottom off), and replacing the broadcom wifi adapter with the Intel 6230 part should be very easy [SEE EDIT BELOW]. There are only 2 antenna wires, so getting the 3 antenna version would be pointless. Also, be sure to get the one with bluetooth if you try this, otherwise you will lose bluetooth since it is provided by the broadcom wifi adapter.The webcam camera does not work well in low light.  Meh.  Turn on a light, I guess.I use the touch pad as little as possible and prefer to use a mouse. It seems to work alright for me when I need it, but I sometimes disable it while typing so I can rest my palms while typing.Overall the negatives are not a big deal for me.Edit Dec-2012: It is indeed very easy to replace the broadcom wifi/bluetooth adapter with the Intel 6230 part. Do NOT get the newer Intel 6235 part as it WILL NOT WORK, as I discovered. Some people have also reported issues with getting the 6230 to work, but the trick is to uninstall all Broadcom software related to the wifi/bluetooth BEFORE installing the 6230. This very importantly includes the WIDCOMM Bluetooth SOftware software. You should also download the Intel drivers for the 6230, and install them after you have removed the Broadcom software. Then open up the laptop and swap the parts and reboot. Your mileage may vary, but it worked for me.::Christopher Bennett::5.0::December 21, 2011

R11NXGR66FLREF::usb 3.0 ports don't work and bad mouse pad with horrible customer service.::So, I bought this computer for work purposes back in April 2012.  Overall, the computer works fine with the exception of a few MAJOR issues.  First thing that went wrong, the mouse pad.  Jumps around when something is plugged into the usb ports, like a cell phone. Still happens, never been resolved.The Samsung function keys seem to work sometimes and then stop. Not sure and have never been given a clear answer.I have called them several times in regards to an Intel error message that keeps popping up. They still have not given me a clear answer as to why it is happening.The most frustrating, the usb 3.0 ports do not work properly. I have tested other computers, and the issue is on Samsungs end. I called the support line and they said they would repair the problem since it's still under warranty.  It was a major hassle speaking with Samsung. Several times they were trying to tell me the problem was the cable or something else. When they finally agreed to repair it I felt like I had won some moral victory.  But they got me in the end.  I just received my laptop back, and no repairs were made since the laptop still has the same usb 3.0 issues, and the kicker, they removed personal folders, Adobe X, and Office professional from my laptop.  Way to go Samsung! Now they want me to send it back to them. I will never recommend this or any Samsung product to anyone ever again. Poor products and poor customer service.  IF you have options, use them.::kevin::2.0::September 13, 2012
R2HEUOM0O8EP31::Major driver issues - not addressed by Samsung::I've had the laptop for about four months now and have had a generally decent time; however, I began to realize after installing a few graphics intensive programs that the "smart-switching" graphics weren't switching to the ATI card. Supposedly there is a work around but Samsung hasn't posted it in any of their tech support areas and hasn't pushed the info to the tech support folks. After spending about an hour and a half chatting with tech support (who initially told me that the ATI card could not work because "you can only use the card built into the computer") the tech support genius told me to re-install the graphics drivers. Seriously Samsung - piss off. I buy something with the expectations that it will work and if it has a flaw like this one that the vendor will make a reasonable effort to fix the problem, not push the work off to the customer.Facebook link to group campaign to get [ ... ] to fix the problem.[ ... ]::Spence Calder::1.0::August 4, 2012
R1DCQ3FBVYT1PC::Great Laptop with one major flaw::Everything about this laptop is great with one exception.They have miss-placed built-in microphone. It is located just left/under of your left hand.I was doing some remote training via Skype and my typing noise and system humming noise were too loud for the training to continue.  Everytime I put my left hand on the keyboard, hand will muffle mic pickup and they would hear key click louder than my voice.  I had to resort to my cell phone to have voice conversion and screen training demo at the same time.  Mic location does not make as sense.Samsung! Other laptops have Mic next to the webcam for that reason.::purecanesugar::3.0::February 24, 2012
R2IIPOTKW4DFK5::DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER::I can tell you right now, this computer is poorly designed and poorly serviced. My laptop has already been back to Samsung THREE TIMES!! The space bar has never worked right! I type with my hands in an upright position and usually only tap the outside edges of the space bar. If you do not hit the space bar within 1 inch of exact center, IT DOESN'T WORK!The first time I sent my Laptop back it was due to HD failure.The second time was because the DVD drive was grinding and failingThis time my Video card went out..SAMSUNG'S RESPONSE: Samsung would like to provide you with an exchange offer of Model: NP700Z5C-S02US.Based on the features and specifications of your original unit Samsung feels that this is the most comparable unit based on our inventory.THIS IS A DOWNGRADE!!!I offered to pay the difference to let me upgrade to a newer version. Their answer was: NO how about a refund??The worst part is.. I wanted to love this computer, it was my first laptop purchase in years.If you care at all about your sanity, do everything you can to avoid buying this computer and supporting this company.::Troy Robson::1.0::October 18, 2012
RX5WG9ZN5F75G::Samsung Display Issues::From what I have read online, other people are having the issue of a display the dims and brightens at random and even though all the addaptive display items have been disabled and the machine is on AC power, ithe dimming continues.I have had this problem now since October 2012 and cannot find any resolutions posted online that work even though many people say they have the same issues. The drivers in this machine suck. I've already lost a lot of work when the machine went crazy one afternoon and the icons all got large and nothing would work. Samsung had me reinstall the original setup. None of this nor any of the subsequent updates have fixed the problem.I can't even pull up this laptop on Samsung's site to get drivers and such. IT's not in their list of Series 7 laptops. That should have been a hint something is wrong.I will try one more time to see if Samsung will acknowledge the issue and provide a fix. After that, if there is no resolution, I will officially be through with Samsung products...all of them.::Dave "Dave"::2.0::July 1, 2013
RVKFNZQANK0GM::Luv this machine.::So far, works flowlesly, super fast, boot up speed is awesome, it feels solid, well built. Installed Medal Of Honor, latest pc game and it runs very smooth. Runs very smooth on i-net multi-player as well. Thought hard about doing Apple, but could not justify paying over twice as much for less performance, maybe not as good OS, but does the job really well, specially with Windows 7. Very happy with the purchase.::Jerry M. Ku "newdad"::5.0::August 27, 2012

I would highly recommend this computer, the big pros to me are the speed, the slot-load DVD drive, great screen, like having the number pad on a 15.6" computer.::James B.

This is unbelievable.  I've had IRQ issues back in the early 90's with old 486's, but come on guys, this is 2013 & Sam's Club dares to sell me this POS laptop?  & how is it that this even has 2.5 stars w/ all the 1 star reviews?  What sort of rating system is that?  This laptop is worthless & now I have to take it back & that really sucks.  I've used it for 30 minutes & I can tell this isn't worth using.

Ever since then it has been working fine I use it almost every day for two years and it has been working fine it is decently fast.  The only bad thing is that crumbs and dust can get into the holes where the speakers are and it is hard to clean other than that definitely worth it for the money.::Joe C::4.0::May 22, 2013
R3TLRU6P3PDXL6::Beware of this Crap::I bought this laptop just a few weeks ago from a different seller but returned it back just after a week's use. This laptop is having numerous issues with it. I found it nothing more, but just an upgraded version of Compaq Presario CQ62-410US 15.6-Inch Notebook.1) Its a bit heavy than other laptops in its class which makes carrying it a pain.2) The mouse-pad feels too clumsy, sticky and irritating while using it.3) Out of 4 GB of total Memory, the system uses around 1.5 GB of Memory just for graphics which actually slows down its performance while doing multiple things at parallel (Multi (3-4) window internet browsing, Skype Chatting, Powerpoint Slides etc.)4)5200 RPM Hard disk drive further adds up to its slow performance along with number of unwanted and useless programs installed on it.5) The most important issue, that I faced with this Laptop was its wireless/network card. Just after 2-3 days of use I started facing problems with its wireless connectivity as many times the wireless wouldn't work while starting the laptop and it took around 2-3 re-start for the system to actually detect the wireless card. Sometimes after 2-3 hours of use the problem of wireless connection dropping would re-surface again and required re-start. I tried to figure out if this issue was due to my router, but then my Old Dell laptop was working fine using the same wireless router connection. Sees to me that the wireless card on this laptop has some-sort of compatibility issue either with hardware or with windows 7 itself.6) I also experienced heating issues after a prolonged use of 3-4 hrs also with the king of usage that I have the average battery life after full charge came out to be 3.5 Hrs.To sum up, if you count on my experience with this laptop, then avoid buying this Laptop and go for other brands. At $399 its NOT A WORTH, you can find many other alternatives below $400 here in Amazon itself.::GadgetGeek::1.0::November 6, 2011

R2IINZX9A842BC::Just Ok::I bought this laptop when amazon was really pushing it for about 365.00. The specs are decent if you only want it for just surfing the net or for a student.What I really like about it is that the in built webcam has a light when its activated so it great when using skype. What I hate about it is that touch pad is rough and the right and left keys are too close together (fingers go further away from where it really is)The price I see they are asking for it now (468.00) is definitely not worth it. If you want a basic computer this is for you.::Ebby::3.0::December 29, 2011

R38A7Q90GFTAQB::Solid Laptop::Bought this laptop from Office Max late January.  It was on sale for $410, but I had to buy $50 worth of accessories to get that price.  Haven't seen that price anywhere else.  I would pay much more for this laptop.  I think it is built well, sturdy, not too big.  It runs cool and has enough power for a casual laptop user such as myself.  I use it to surf the web and stream sports and other video.  It does everything I need it to with ease, plus it stays very cool.  Beats Audio is the best laptop sound I have heard.  I know people with Toshiba and Acer laptops and the sound quality is not nearly as good as this laptop.  The keyboard is a good size and includes a number pad, which is nice.  Screen is bright and crisp.  Appearance of laptop is quality as well....it has a brushed stainless steel look.  Definitely one of the better looking laptops.  I researched laptops for a couple months and found HP to be one of the better units when it comes to quality of materials.  I thought Samsung, Toshiba, Acer, and Asus laptops felt cheap in comparison to this laptop.  Keep in mind I was looking at laptops in the $400-$500 range.  Many of the aforementioned laptop companies improve in quality drastically when you go up in price.  I was definitely looking at the base model price range.  That being said, this is not a base model unit.  This is a mid-range unit that belongs in the $500-$600 price range and will compare to any other laptop in that range.  Go to Best Buy and see what you can get for $500-$600 and you will see this is a superior laptop to others in that range.  I have been very happy with my purchase.  I had to contact HP Support on a couple occasions during setup.  Support is hit or miss with any company.  The first person I talked to was not much help.  The second person I talked to was very helpful and knowledgeable, and he helped me solve my problem quickly.  The problem had to do with connecting to my network and had noting to due with computer malfunction.  Overall I am very happy with this computer and would buy it again if I needed another.::Amazon Customer::5.0::February 17, 2012
R1BZT3UIULU3E6::naah!::I bought this computer for about 510 bucks thinking it was worth but i now have some complains and i also have to send it to HP to fix the webcam.1.

Extreme overheating with low-res games. Playing GTA SA or RE4 makes the gpu overheat and smells like burned.4. Poor GPU. You can't run smoothly a game. Works Fine with arkham asylum but temps increase inmediately.5.

R9GD9M3KXIE1E::HP Laptop PC FAILED - DOA Keyboard Fell Apart, Keys Fell Off::This HP Hewlett Packard Laptop PC (Model DV6-6130US) FAILED miserably. It arrived with a keyboard that was hanging loose, it bounced up and down and caused all kinds of errors. It could not be used. We made four videos of it and posted to YouTube under the HP model number.Then we found a hundred other reviews of HP laptop keyboard malfunctions on various HP laptop PCs too. The Escape key was broken off. The entire computer was unusable and we had to return it to the Amazon Marketplace seller, through Amazon's A-to-Z guarantee program the first week we had it.Recommend: Do not purchase any HP laptop PC because the company is ignoring reports of defective keyboards.

R6S802US5E4A3::Worst Customer Service::DO NOT BUY HP PRODUCTS!HP has the worst customer service. I took my laptop in because there was a short in my video cable that caused my monitor to flicker. They wiped my hard drive, tried to deny my warranty by saying I spilled soda all over the mother board (apparently I sat my laptop on a sticky spot once, but the substance never got near any internal parts), and after several long weeks, sent it back STILL BROKEN with a $800 bill! Customer service ran me in circles for months trying to get the issue resolved before I finally got a phone call basically saying, "That's too bad." When I took the laptop to the local repair shop I got the cable replaced in under 24 hours and only paid $50.Toshiba, Samsung and Sony are all GREAT machines; they're more reliable and won't treat you like trash while stealing your cash.::Ryanne::1.0::November 26, 2011

R6CZQKP890GDQ::Bait & Switch from 3rd party provider "Rugged Notebooks"::Sorry to post this, as I know Amazon says "Don't describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback)". BUT MY CUSTOMER FEEDBACK WAS DELETED.I ordered this laptop as it is advertised above: Panasonic Toughbook CF-74, 2GB, running Windows 7That's what it says on this page, that's what it said in the e-mail order confirmation, that's what it said in the "pending Orders" page here at Amazon.But what Rugged Notebooks sent was: Panasonic Toughbook CF-74, ~ONE~ GB, running Windows ~XP~!Note the difference? Funny thing, when I sent a "contact the seller" message, they CALLED me. (how the heck did they get my phone number?!?!) Of course, by doing this there would be no "paper trail" of messages that Amazon representatives could look at later.Rugged Notebooks initially admitted they had screwed up, and were going to e-mail me a return label. THEN a senior representative called back and said they had NOT screwed up, and that I should have looked at the "fine print" on the second page. They still were willing to have me send it back for a refund, so that's what I did.4 days AFTER UPS reports Rugged Notebooks received my return, I still had no refund, so I opened a dispute with Amazon A-to-Z. A day later I got my money back (which is one reason why I use Amazon).I posted a shortened version of this in the "Customer Feedback" for Rugged Notebooks, and lo & behold, it has been removed, along with my 1-star. I have requested an explanation from Amazon as to why they removed it, but in the mean-time I am posting this here.In My Opinion, you should NEVER buy anything from Rugged Notebooks.::Geoff::1.0::April 9, 2014
R33RMO288S3YVQ::Very identical to a macbook air but with windows 7!::I'm an IT professional and VERY picky when it comes to my laptop. I read the reviews on this and was mixed between the good and bad on here, so I decided to visit a Microsoft Store and check it out on my own. I immediately was amazed how thin and light this was just like a MacBook Air (which I used and had before).  I compared this to the Samsung series 9 laptop and although yes I wish it had a non-glossy screen it still beats it in price tag and performance.Pros:-Laptop does not show any traces of fingerprints (which annoyed me with other laptops)-Screen is very crisp and clear. Yes, its glossy but its a "comfortable glossy" like the macbook air-Keys are very responsive and comfortable. You do have to press a bit more but I easily got used to it.-The touchpad is the best I've ever used on any Windows laptop. Very smooth and responsive like a macbook.-Great performance as it has the i5 processor-Super fast bootup and screen on/off time-Simple and basic in terms of ports (2) USB and HDMI which are positioned perfectly in the back. I see no need for laptops to have tons of ports on the sides and back adding bulk to it.-For this price its a steal compared to what other manufacturers are charging.Cons:-The up/down/left/right keys are tiny, but eventually you get used to it-Battery life is not as long as MacBook Air but its still descent for an ultrabook.-Yes, its true that the click button below the touchpad you have to press very hard (mostly for a right click), however if you go into mouse settings and just enable "single tap" and set up "double tap" as a pop up menu, you will have no need to press down on pad at all.  This has such amazing trackpad drivers that I can glide through pages and screens with no effort.Overall, don't let the Acer name or price fool you, this laptop is a gem and best design, performance and feel I have ever seen outside of Apple.  I bought mine from a Microsoft Store which has the Microsoft Signature service (basically they re-load the OS with no bloatware).  If your in the market for a Windows 7 thin, fast and on the go laptop, this is the one for you!::DRK_TECH::5.0::November 10, 2011
R1Z8CU2J9VL237::Excelent!!::I had this ultrabook for a week now and I can say it's amazing so far. It's thin, light, fast and comfortable. It looks good, it's quiet and cool (I mean temperature). Before I bought this I read all the reviews available online. I completely understand the reviewers have to criticize something but for me this computer works perfectly well. For example, many people say that the keys are too short. In my opinion the keys are comfy. The screen is not the best, but it's very good. This is not a gamer computer; it's for the ones that need to carry it from one place to the other. Taking into account its size and weight, I couldn't expect more from this machine. I come from a ThinkPad that is a heavy duty. I can see this computer is not as strong as the ThinkPad, but it's on a different league if you take into account the price you pay for one of the smallest computers available.The Core i5 it's powerful enough for the tasks I perform (Web, Excel, Word, some Photoshop). The SSD for "instant on" works as magic. You open the computer and its right there asking for your password (if you setup one). Battery life seems to be good although I can imagine it will suffer in the long term as I'm not able to remove the battery when it's plugged in. On normal use (internet, mail, and few YouTube videos) you get between 4 and 5 hours. I haven't tried playing a movie yet, but I guess you'll get enough power to watch it all the way.::Sol Botindari::5.0::November 2, 2011
R2M2S7PC3RBRI4::I'm really enjoying it so far::So, I won this thing on the Acer A Day Give Away. (So - I might be a little biased, cause they just gave me a free computer.)I was sort of in the market for a new laptop, and I really was not looking for a ultrabook. I'm more of a big clunky machine with a  big screen and all the bells and whistles type of guy.Imagine my surprise when I got this thing and have found that I really, really like it. I don't have an issue with the noise, nor do I mind the lack of CD drive. I think the start up time is fast, and the laptop overall is a great little machine. It feels really sturdy to me, despite the light weight. I really like that it does not get hot... like, at all. I had it running on battery power for nearly 4 hours the other day, shut it off, and felt the underside. It was tepid.I read reviews before I got the laptop that the keys were an issue. Some people complained about the keys not having the right amount of heft, which caused them to miss keys, or were unable to hit the arrow keys. Again, I like big things. Big keyboards included. That said. I don't have an issue, at all with the keyboard. I've not had any problems with the arrow keys. In fact, my only issue so far is that there are no dedicated function keys. There are function keys, but they're not dedicated (That is - I'd like to have a volume control, playback controls for video, etc.)I'm a big fan of the multitouch trackpad. I love that I can use gestures to make stuff happen. Took me a while to figure out how to use them correctly, but now that I have, I'm enjoying it. My only complaint is that you cannot create your own gestures, and can only use a predefined list of finger motions to trigger a predefined list of actions -- at least, using the stock software (I do not know of alternate software at the moment).Beyond that, it came with a lot of bloatware. Easily fixed, but a minor annoyance.___________________Edit: Exactly one year to the day after I received this thing, the trackpad stopped functioning properly and I cannot penetrate ACER's paywall to their warranty support. Absolutely no one has helped me with this. They're being very, very unhelpful and that has completely changed my opinion of this product.I would not buy this computer again, nor would I have any future business dealings with ACER because of their (obviously) well timed product failures, and refusal to help their customers.::Charlie::1.0::November 26, 2011
R2ZLP6OHB936W::Defective Hardware -- Be Wary!::I bought the laptop for $799 on Amazon.com around Jan 2012. After it arrived, it worked OKAY. The track pad was not nearly as responsive as in a larger laptop, or in a MacBook Air, but no big deal.  I can adjust to that, and I did.  But there were significantly worse problems.First problem - Defective Wireless Card. (See also, e.g., the 2-star review by "The Inveterate Scofflaw 'J'").  On random occasions, perhaps once every one to three hours of use time, the wireless adapter just goes out.  *POOF*  No, it is not that I went out of network range, etc. Rather, the computer acts as if I had manually disabled the wireless, and there is nothing that can be done to bring it back.  Rebooting will work, and I realized later that putting the computer to sleep, which takes much less time, will also cure the nuisance. So I have had to do that, usually once every several hours, randomly, whenever the wireless card craps out on me. This was not a big deal, as it usually takes no more than 10-15 seconds total to put the computer to sleep and wake it up.  The quick sleep-awake response, to be fair, is a nice aspect of this computer.Second problem - Defective Hard Drive. (See also, e.g., the 1-star review by "frank"). About one month after getting this computer, I was using it on the train when all of the sudden I got a blue screen. Upon reboot, I keep getting an error message and windows will not boot. I google the error message, and learned that it was indicative of hard drive failure, and that other people whose laptops sustained a physical impact have had that message.  My computer never fell.  As a result of this, I shipped the computer in to Acer, and they ended up replacing the hard drive (just as I figured). So all my data was lost. Not a big deal, I only had it for a month, but still, but be warned!My computer arrives in two weeks or so, and the invoice says that a new hard drive was installed. So far so good, but one day later, the computer starts doing clicking sounds randomly, and then I get a blue screen. Upon reboot, the clicking sounds (which are annoying an scary, think about fingernails on chalkboard) continue and I get an error message about have no boot drive.Conclusion: This computer was a bad decision, and the problems discussed herein are likely a product of Acer trying to use sub-par technology in an ultra-thin laptop. MacBook Air laptops, for example, all have solid state drives -- no disk drives. I think having an actual disk drive in such a thin computer is asking for trouble. Similar issues may have been with the poor contact between the wireless card and the mainboard.At any rate, I am happy that Amazon.com has a very easy return policy for defective computers.::Alex::1.0::February 18, 2012
R2PHVJVACVH6D5::This is it for the price::I usually do not write reviews, but felt what I read was not correct.  This computer is great.  The keyboard which some have said is bad is not the case.  I had an Apple laptop and found it similar.  The screen is great and I've got Slingbox which is TV internet and it looks great.  The small buttons on the right - get real!! no big deal.  This things starts up before i blink!!  The speed and connection are great!!  I did a lot of research before buying and when I clicked send in the buying cart, I initiallly had remorse as I was wishing that I was being too cheap and a few hundred would have made my life complete.  When i got the computer.  What a great surprise. The top is great.  As for plastic, it does not feel cheap, but smart in cost. Also, my Mac was hot on the bottom, this computer is cool on bottom.  Not sure why but it is.  The layout is great. The hinge is fine, no problem that I see that some reported.  Love the keyboard, which the experts said was lacking. Still not sure what they are talking about. I can buy almost two of these computers for what the others are charging.  No Brainer!!  Buy it!!  P.S. They came out with a new one that is $1400 with SDD and i7.  Get the i5 not that big a difference to pay $700 extra.::Amazon Customer::5.0::November 24, 2011

Really affordabe price as compared to Apple equivalents; 6. Feature a solid state drive for system programs, that makes Acer S3 unique and upfront among its competitors.Weakness1. No other colors available; 2. Can't use backup batteries (but 6 hrs of battery life may be good enough).::I. Shih::5.0::November 5, 2011
R1KGB8L3XE1XEO::keyboard::My story might be able to bring you an answer if you have concern with reviews about the keyboard.In Dec, 2011, I bought this Acer S3 from Costco because it fits all my needs perfectly and it turns out to be a perfect laptop except one issue - the keyboard. The keyboard looks very nice, like the Mac keyboard, however, it seems I had to press it very hard and right in the middle, otherwise, I will miss keys. It seems the issue is the key only works when you press the center part and hard enough. If you accidentely pressed the corner, you will miss the key @ 80% of the time, especially on keys: 'N', 'M', 'Dot', 'A'... because you had to reach out your finger to those keys and very likely you will miss them. I liked this laptop so much that I was trying to force myself to get use to the keyboard, however after 1 month , I gave up and had to return it...I researched the market extensively after that trying to find a similiar laptop... and eventually I had to come back to Acer S3 since it's simply the best deal in the market. I also read tons of reviews online, some of them complain about the keyboard issue liked me and some claim the keyboard works perfectly, which made me wonder, maybe I got a defect one, so I decided to give Acer S3 one more try.Thanks to Costco, I got a new Acer S3 right away. I drove back home, unpacked it, turned it on and opened a notepad and started tying.... WHAT A HUGE SURPRISE, THE KEYBOARD WORKS GREAT for me this time! It is indeed like most of other reviews said, it's very comfy to type on, I still need to press a little bit harder than usual, but it's very easy to get used to and the most important thing is, I don't miss key this time, even when I pressed at the very corner of the keys. Note, I type super fast and that's why the keyboard is very important to me, and I can tell you this, this keyboard works GREAT!All I want to say is both the good and bad reviews of the Acer S3 keyboard are true, depending on which one you get. Don't be stopped by the bad review and if you did get one with keyboard issue, I would recommend you to exchange one, and you will be happy with what you get. :)::Nina::5.0::January 23, 2012
RPD4SJB7UOYSR::Great Computer::This computer is great.Pros: Very lightweightGreat battery lifeHDMI portFeels pretty well builtCons: bloat... but it's expected.Nothing else really comes to mind.There was someone complaining about the lack of an ethernet port, but it's really to save space. The MacBook Air also doesn't have one. You can also buy a usb adapter for it if you really need it.Overall, it's a great computer!::Jimmi::5.0::November 5, 2011
R9PQU0048TQDG::Sturdy, efficient, practical, and affordable laptop::I will keep this preview very short and to the point. I got this laptop for my birthday. I have been using computers (pc and laptops) for decades, and I am working in the Research and Engineering so I rely on computers more than the average. I will list pros and cons with reasoning. I am hoping this review helps you with your laptop hunting. Good luck.ProsWeight - Obviously this laptop is very light. Typically light electronics suffer from stability and it becomes rather fragile but this laptop is very study. The back and front side is protected by the thin aluminum / Chromium alloy casing and the back side is even more sturdy as it is a little bit thicker.Battery - Battery is very efficient. It seems to be lasting up to 4.5h with mild and 3h with heavy applications (such as video, or gaming)The hardware - The hardware is obviously is not the top of the line but Acer tries to close this gap using virtual memory from the hard drive (20gb of space for the virtual memory). So to an extend, the speed and the computer power have been maximized. This computer can handle decent games, all programs including illustrator etc.The Heat test - The laptop is not overheating. This is important as most of the thin products overheats within a hour. Acer is solving this problem with their patented heat sink design. Thats a big plus.- Keyboard - I have big fingers and this keyboard is perfect. Keys are well separated and very practical. However, page up and down keys are poorly located and tiny.Cons:- Sound: Even though the laptop's sound system is from Dolby, the sound quality is lower than average laptop. However, if you are using headset, the sound quality is better than average laptop. The speakers are small (to make it compact) but had to be loud enough: For that reason, they are failing most times.- Screen: Screen is glossy looking. I dont mind this, however if you are not in love with iphone's glossy look (or ipad, ipod etc) this screen is not meant for you.- Location of the USB port: It is located at the back of laptop. So when you are using your laptop, the access is limited. Also since the laptop is so thin, my keychain USB is not very easy to plug it in.::S. Tongay "db"::5.0::January 13, 2012
R1CB390ABCATXK::It does its job!::I have owned this laptop for about a month now and it does all that it said it would do.  I would like to see more USB ports on the computer.  (There are only two) I did have to purchase a CD DVD unit.  That is the easiest way to load software etc.  The Wi-Fi works just fine.  I bought a Wi-Fi booster so I can use it out back by the pool.  I really like how light it is.  I carry it in a tablet case.  Battery time is good.::J. Demers::4.0::November 28, 2011
RCRSIRYZ14QHE::About SSD+HD combination::Recently bought this and have been using it 10-12 hrs a day for about 2 weeks now.My opinion is that all the 1 or 2 star ratings are most likely because of defective units. ALL computers/laptops will have a percentage of defective units. Acer is no different.All other reviews on S3 have touched on various pros and cons. So, I will just focus on my experience with "cons" that were mentioned by other reviews.Keyboard works fine for me and I type 40-50 wpm.Touch pad is surprisingly the best I've used, very responsive to a point that I can understand why some would think it's too sensitive.  It's just a matter of adjusting one's own touch.Screen resolution is more than adequate on a 13" screen.  I was a bit hesitating about this but now I have no issue with it.Battery drains fast if you crank up the screen brightness all the time.  If you adjust it so it is "just bright enough" when lighting condition changes, you will get a decent 5-6 hours of use easily.Metal/plastic construction is MORE than solid.  A little give here and there on plastic parts when pressed hard...nothing to worry about.  Personally, I'd choose light weight materials over metal.Finally, the most talked about compromise of SSD+HD combo in term of performance.  To me, this is just debating between a car that can do 0-60 in 5 seconds and another can do it in 7 seconds.  98% of normal driving in daily life does the 2 second performance really make a difference?  Minimal.  I have a SONY with i7 core and SSD.  I don't feel my SONY is that much faster unless I am running some serious applications and I time it with a stopwatch.  That's the only time I see the performance difference.This is the best bang for the buck Ultrabook to get now.I took 1 star off because out of the last two weeks when I put it to sleep roughly 20 times each day, I've experienced about 3 incidents that it became unresponsive and I had to reboot.::T. Hsu::4.0::March 27, 2012
R1T8CP340DZJ2L::ordered twice both were DEFECTIVE::1st laptop, the network adapter was defective, wifi connectio gets dropped now and then,the system has to be restarted2nd laptop, when the lid is open beyond 90 degrees, the display blanks out:(Liked the design,light weight and instant start in this next gen laptop, too bad it was not built durable, thanks to amazon and i can return them, unlike bestbuy where there might be restocking fee and crappy customer service to put up with.::Arhtu::2.0::March 16, 2012
R2TMKITB1PVRB4::It's great but extremely noisy::Well, everything positive is already said and I've nothing to add on this - it's a really awesome laptop for a reasonable price except one big issue: effing NOISE. It's terrible, I can't stand it in a quite room even for 5 minutes, my head starts to blow up.::TA::4.0::December 28, 2011
RUG6W4KF1IEL3::Extralight quality laptop::Excellent ultrabook with this price. Easy move around. Feel all other regular laptops heavy. No issues so far. Own it for over a month. Build quality and looks are great. love it.::C. Lwin::5.0::November 28, 2011
R1W5IEHCAOQ6N8::Acer has done it again - a Breakthrough!::I've waited months for this machine to hit the market. It's an exciting new product.At .4" thin it reminds me of my iPad, but much more powerful. It's as fast as my office desktop, that I paid 3 times more for this last Summer.It's just beautiful... like my MacBook Pro but ½ the weight, ½ the price, and twice the performance.What else can I say? You won't go wrong with it.TaosGuyTaos NM::TaosGuy "Taos Guy"::5.0::October 16, 2011
R1U6MZTFQA9DRD::Not an Mac Air-Killer, but not bad::Let me start by saying that our home is all on the 'dark-side' and we have any number of Apple-based computers.  I still wanted a mobile, small, lightweight PC to use with software that comes in PC form.  The Aspire S3 comes close - far from perfect, but it will do for what I need.  The form-factor is nice - I especially like the aluminum lid - but he rest of the machine does feel pretty plasticky - it is really a plastic body, with an aluminum sheet on the lid.  It does not carry the robust feel of my Macbook Air - so I sometimes feel I have to treat it somewhat gingerly.  Everything works fine (once you remove all the bload-ware that comes pre-loaded) - I was a bit surprised by how often the heat fan kicks in even when doing the most basic tasks.  The battery life is at best 'OK' - so far I am lucky to get much more than a couple of hours out of it when browsing or word-processing.  Would not call it lightning fast - resume from sleep is fast, but performance is again 'OK'.  There are a couple of things I don't particularly like about the design - first the touchpad is on the one hand way to sensitive - it's easy to move the cursor or accidentally click while typing or moving around the screen.  On the other hand the touchpad is a bit stiff when you want to right-click - you really have to press quite hard - which is especially difficult when trying to select a region.  If you use a mouse, it is much easier.  The other thing I don't care for in the design is the positioning of the USB ports at the back.  They are stiff (tough to get the cables in and out) and they are too close to the power cable - which has a big old connector that gets in the way.  You have to arrange the cables in such a way that the machine sits flat on the desk.  For $900 it is a bit on the pricy side when compared to what you can get from Apple (admitedly their equivalents are over $1000) - so if I were chosing I would probably save for a couple more months and spring for the Mac.  Peformance-wise you can get the same for much less than $900 in the PC world - but if small form-factor and relative light weight is a big deal, then this machine is pretty good.  In short, you are paying to for the cool 'Air-like' look - but that look is pretty superficial - a bit like having a sexy Mustang, but with a Ford Focus engine in it.::Nick Miller::3.0::November 7, 2011
RL6B645LHOFMW::Not 3 lbs...::Revised: Acer Aspire S3-951-6646 Ultrabook  I took off 1 star for a heavy charger & another for a wonky keypad. I originally took 2 stars off because I bought this for travel and weight was a primary consideration-- It was advertised as 3.1 lbs, but discovered the charger cord with it's brick and heavy 3-prong plug weighed in at a whopping 12 oz. so the real weight nearly 4 lbs. I also have to carry an 2-prong adapter for the 3-prong plug which makes it heavy, cumbersome and needs about 4 in. clearance from the wall. Some companies (Samsung & Apple) are making cords with small or no transformers.After using this for 2 months, I think it's worth noting that I did travel with this machine for a month and did not find the weight too inconvenient. I did, however, discover that I needed a mouse because the keypad is seriously spastic--pointer and pages jump all over the place--however it performs fine with a mouse. Battery life is realistically 3-4 hrs.Pros: Nice size, good wifi range, fast, nice screen resolution, stays cool.Cons are:· no ethernet connection to hardwire broadband (haven't found this to be a problem)· cord with a heavy 3 prong plug and transformer brick adds another 12 oz.. spastic keypadBottom Line: Overall I'm very happy with my new ultrabook, and given the price considerations, I do not regret my choice and would recommend it.::Cee H::3.0::January 14, 2012
R3GUTKQWKIJYDX::Good performance, Thin, love the storage and connects fast::Love my new computer!  Decided to upgrade my 3yr old laptop and was surprised by how  much technology has changed over the  years.  This computer is hands down one of  the best in the market.  I  been looking for a laptop for  business, as I travel quite often,and nothing comes close to what  the S3 offers--  It is so easy to carry, connects fast to internet and I can do multiple things with an ease.My kids has been using ipads for over a year now, and now they want to use my new laptop!!  I may end  up buying another one for Xmas!!You get what you pay for. Awesome buy. happy overall.::SSunprimeuser::5.0::October 16, 2011
R31CNMKQLDIU71::Nice laptop::I needed to replace my Samsung NC10 and wanted something as light and easy to move around.  I first bought the Mac Air 11.  I'm a senior aged woman, not a techie by any stretch, and just couldn't learn the Mac operating system. I returned it and bought the Acer Aspire.It works fine -- I'm able to do what I need, email, internet, spreadsheets, documents, without any difficulty.  The unit is light enough to use on the couch, at the kitchen table, or wherever I need to go. The battery lasts at least a whole day.  The price was less than the other Ultrabooks currently on the market. It starts up almost as fast as the Mac which is a really nice feature.  I have it for a month now, and no complaints.::R. Parisi::5.0::March 15, 2012
R2QXGCMIDSC0G7::Loving my new laptop!::So I have been using my new Acer ultrabook for about 5days now.  I bought it for personal use, and so I don't have to share with my son.  Mostly I use it for internet, email, facebook, pictures, videos, and the occasional document.  I love the size!  I was worried the screen might be a little small but its perfect, and so light weight and easy to carry.  It holds a charge really well.  Its super fast, and loads really quickly.  The only complaint I have is that the internet connection cuts out sometimes, or doesn't load well.  It could just be my wireless system though.  All in all I am very happy with it, and am satisfied with the cost.::SherMc::4.0::March 3, 2012
R35PVMFYTPEJAO::A very nice ultrabook::The first thing I need to say, this is a good computer, it is fast, light and even the keyboard is fine.  The only issue is the left mouse button on the pad is stiff but that is getting better with time.  You will get between 4.5 and 5 hours of battery life.  The price is very good.  I called customer service to purchase the extended warranty and that was tough to do, for a company who wants to earn money they made it very difficult to get through to, other then these few things I'm happy.::Robert::4.0::January 11, 2012
R1HB9QWBS4QQTF::Needs Improvements::This laptop is overpriced. It's thin and light, however, the weight of the base is not heavy enough to support the weight of the screen - when tilted, the laptop tips backwards. The brightness of the screen can be improved and the touch-pad is definitely a problem. It's difficult to find the left and right buttons on the touch-pad and the sensitivity is off causing the cursor to jam in place - especially when typing or surfing the web. The battery life dose not deliver on its promise. In my opinion, this laptop is a larger version of a netbook, but with much higher price.::Alex::2.0::February 9, 2012
R1UVZ0SVQ8SFGF::Ultrabooks have Arrived FINALLY!!::People,This review is only about Acer Aspire S3 without any comparison with Macbook's - coz MACBOOK Still WINS in terms of Beauty and Looks.But Hey!! are you willing to pay that much in this economy when you get same comparable product for 674$, if your answer is NO and Read BelowPros,1. Chicklet keyboard is very responsive. I agree that Page up/down buttons are smaller but they are WAY BIGGER than any smart phone touchscreen buttons. So anyone using Smartphone shoud not have any issues.2. Screen is fantastic if not the Best is Business. But for this price it is better than VAIO's3. Battery life with normal use (Office 2010, Browser) is 3.5 hours4. Looks sleek and feel as much as Apple's 11 inchers5. Wake up Time -  WOW!!! Just 3 Seconds...now thtz one advantage Acer has over any ultrabooks, read below for details6. It has 20 GB of SSD and 320 GB HDD. 20GB SSD is invisible to users as it is used by system to bring up the computer to desktop as fast as possible and transfers the control to HDD. You wont find this AWESOME feature in any other Ultrabooks. Even if you find it than not at this price.7. Dolby speakers -  Speakers have always been one of the strongs points of Acer and they maintain that standard with this machine.8. Port - Go figure this many port in any MACS or Ultrabooks for this price, you will find NONE. Card Read, USB 2.0, HDMI, Headset.Not so great:1. Keyboard is not backlit now i am not a huge fan of backlit when i get this machine for 674$. How i got is for this price...read the last paragraph.2. Keyboard color is not that exciting, but it is much better than Asus and Lenovo's ultrabooks.If you have Microsoft Store Around, I have one in Tysons Corner, VA. MS Retail store is carrying 20% off on 500$ or more. 25% off on 1000$ or more.Here is what i did1. Bought this machine2. took there Microsoft Assure Plan worth 200$ - which provides 2 years extended warranty including accident coverage and a MS office software.3. That brought my total to 1100 and with discount of 275$ brought it down to 825. So the total I paid was 825+40$ = 865$ (which prints laptop price to 674$).4. If you simply buy the laptop, then it will be even 100$ less, but remember this are new genes of machine and you never know what may break.5. It is still much better deal than what Amazon is offering. If you dont have MS Store around than Amazon is the 2nd best.::TechGeek::4.0::December 11, 2011
RM5ZCL2EQQWVJ::Looking for performance, features and design this one's for YOU!::If you're coming in from the Desktop or casual dual core laptop that did the job, you're in for a most pleasant surprise.  We all knew it was just a matter of time before the laptops of yesterday got more portable, lightweight and powerful.  The Acer S3 did it with class.  I got mine a few weeks ago and began to load the 320 gig hard drive with all my "stuff" from an older Gateway laptop through the on-board system transfer software.  After completion I began to test some of the largest spreadsheets and power graphic projects I have been working on and they all excelled faster, clearer and with less wait time during conversions than before, and it barely put a dent in the hard drive space.  It also boasts a 20 gig solid state drive.  Basically that's a secondary drive that stores your data for quick starting...it takes like 2 seconds to start after shutting the case closed.  It has a lot of other great features too.I saved the best for last....This thing looks awesome!!!  When you slide this little gem into the cuff of your hand and walk into a room...all eyes go wide and are their mouths quickly follow suit.  Less than the thickness of a dime, under 3 lbs and as sleek as a M---B---- Air @ about a 35% less the comparable model price.You're gonna love it!!Acer Aspire S3-951-6646 13.3-Inch HD Display Aluminum Ultrabook::RTyler "T2"::5.0::November 7, 2011
R26YSKRCT0WOA3::Do NOT buy ACER::I bought this notebook NOV 2, 2011. It was OK and actually I liked it very much.Then JAN 17, 2011 I notice the notebook acts strange, it looks like hardware error.Called ACER service and they have me a few instruction, but basically reboot the notebook.Around March 15, I had same stange freeze again, did same with ACER Service and reboot.And finally today, the notebook makes hugh noice from hard drive, of course freeze, it is surly looks like hard drive error.Called ACER service again, long talk.ACER service is saying the notbook is 1 year warrny, but software is 6 month warranty, so I have to purchase extended warranty which is $299, and they will not service my notebook unless I purchase this extended warranty. And I think even thought I buy this extended warranty, problem will be same.I claimed ACER service why should I buy extended warranty while it is not even 6 month yet. But ACER siad "NO"So I called Amazon and explained all over.Amazon was very freindly and suggested me to return the notebook for 80% refund.I will return this ACER notebook tomorrow.I have another one of same notebook which still works fine.I think if you buy ACER, try to pick up good one.ACER WARRANTY is make you pay more money for NOTHING.Well they have guts to say "NO" to the customer for warranty service.Good Luck ACER !!!::Duk S.

R3LX95LXB8LDC7::Finally.. Apple Alternative Arrived...::Finally after months of waiting for Windows Ultrabook laptop, my Acer's S3 arrived.  What surprised me the most was the EASY setup.. it took less than 3minutes to setup the system and I was doing what I needed to do! Acer makes it very simple to cut the B.S. and let user get to do what they want to do.I am blown away from Instant On-- It feels like you are using your mobile phone or TV. It just works.... simple as that.Performance is just AWESOME! and.. don't forget it has 320GB HD!! Vs. SDD! Storage capacity is awesome and I love my new S3!$400 below Macbook air- I was thinking about replacing my 1.5 year old model- and happy made this decision.Acer did again!Cheers,::AppleFanBoy::5.0::October 16, 2011
RIE1EV8RTOO6I::Love light weight and speed, died just less then a year! :(::I really loved my ultrabook so very much. I really enjoyed carrying my new ultrabook everywhere, because it was not heavy.  It was fast and performed well, until it died, just last week.I was at the airport using my ultrabook, when the SCREEN WENT WHITE! It would not boot, or do anything anymore.IMPORTANT: You need the S/N number under the barcode on the bottom of the ACER to get ACER support online. I could find no phone numbers to call for ACER technical support!  It is not possible to read the S/N or serial number under the bar code on the back on the book anymore! I had several techs look at it and they all agree the problem was hardware and my ultrabook needs a new hard drive. Now this ACER hard drive needs to be replaced only by ACER. I back up my files weekly, so I did not lose much, but lost my best PC.I searched my home for the ACER box with the S/N barcode and number. Just found the box with the S/N numbers in time to contract ACER before a one year factory warrantee would run out. Finally,  I contracted ACER on their web site with the S/N number in time.  ACER has not responded to me yet with any help. I do not know where to send this for repair. It just about a year now, since I bought my ultrabook and hope I can get help, and the manufacture warrantee is honored, with delays in ACERS response.::Maureen Scully::2.0::December 17, 2012

R32HMREWYD0IHU::Light, fast and thin::This is a pretty nice computer. I bought my wife a Macbook air and bought me a Acer. Both computers have a i5 processor which makes both of them pretty fast. There has been only one time that I saw the MBA beat the Acer, it was when we were installing Rosetta Stone. The MBA was lightning fast but the Acer was not too shabby either. I have not had any issues with freezing or anything of the sort. We did have to restart my wife's MBA a couple times due to freezing.One thing that people say is that it feels cheap with the plastic bottom, I personally like that since the MBA's metal frame can be hard on the wrist...The new Ultrabook is great. It can compete with Mac all the way.But if you want both, get both and you can have the best of both worlds :)Cons: Yeah, the arrow keys are small but really does not bother me too much. Also the trackpad does feel a little "plasticy"::New Acer Guy::4.0::April 25, 2012
R3KOZ6UXESI9TO::Great design, lots of room for improvement though::I got this laptop while Amazon was running a $100 gift card promotion. This looked like a pretty good deal to me.Design, looksActually the laptop looks pretty cool, You wouldnt guess its an acer or its price from its looks - except of course for the  ACER logo on the lid. The design is pretty snazzy and exudes a premium look.WeightThis laptop is very lightweight and is everything that a normal person would expect from an ultrabookPerformanceThis machine had quite a bit of bloatware installed on it, was a pain trying to weed out each of them. The performance is fairly ok - but I was hoping for better from an i5 machine. This could probably be because of the ssd+regular harddrive.Im sure the SSD version would be faster but then its much more expensive. This performed much slower than my dell latitude office laptop with an i5 processor with pretty much the same config and no SSD hybrid drive. Go figure.A sliver lining - The dolby home theater software on it is great, the sound from this laptop is great.KeyboardIs not the greatest, the arrow keys are a joke and the fact that there are no dedicated volume control keys makes using this laptop downright cumbersome.ScreenThe viewing angels on this screen is terrible. You would really hope for these prices they should come with better screens.The worst part is the screen does not stay stable when open, if you have this on your lap and move it slightly the screen starts swaying up nd down a bit, cant imagine how its gonna get after a few months of use. Definite no on an ultrabook.I was in two minds about whether to return this or not and finally I did. Special thanks to Amazon for their awesome customer care!!::A. Soman::2.0::April 9, 2012
RV5TTZS0M87BO::Worst laptop ever::Although I don't usually comment on products, this piece of garbage pushed me to the wall. It is by far the worst laptop I had so far. With owning it for about 10 months now, it runs slower than my old inspiron 6400 dell (which still functions perfectly but old). The battery doesn't last up to 30mins anymore, the mouse is the worst ever. Why be an apple wanna-be if you can just function well being your old self. This is a piece of ish, I might put it out on the curb for trash, or jus give it out for -100 bucks... please don't buy this CRAP. I would rate it as a -5 if d bar was here.::Oluwadamilare Banire::1.0::October 11, 2013
R3236J3NKMDMAJ::White screen::After an year, (a month out of warranty) the laptop just shows a white screen. The display cable is apparently torn!! Acer wants me to ship the laptop for repair - will cost me 300$! :(This seems to be a fairly common problem .. I have met two other people who faced the same issue with an acer ultrabook. Don't buy it!::Sailaja::1.0::August 31, 2013
R3CM9MX5VGTV8Z::Broke twice within roughly a year::This computer is definitely not worth the money. It broke just before my warranty was over. I sent it in to acer and the hard drive was replaced. It worked for another 2 weeks and died again. Another problem with the hard drive. Now since the warranty expired in the mean time, I wasn't even able to contact acer anymore without paying a high fee. I decided to order the recovery cds instead which weren't included and didn't help either. I am still trying to fix it but no success so far. So much trouble for a computer that was quite expensive and barely lasted through the warranty. I will not buy another product from acer!::Sara::1.0::July 13, 2013
RUTR9U1RAM48::Thin CHic but bad quality as always::This super thin and light weight, smaller than Macair, but acer is incapable of provide good quality, so it is not surprise that the screen turned white out of a sudden after 8 months.::Feifei Wang::2.0::December 14, 2012
R2VHLYH6EMNW6::Terrible device and terrible customer service::I purchased this computer in April of 2012, it is now November of 2012 and I am sending it back for the second time to be repaired. Both times the computer would not boot up, and explaining this to the customer service reps that know english as a second language is very difficult. This may have been the last PC I ever buy. My next computer purchase will be an Apple. Save your money, time, and frustration, DO NOT BUY an ACER, and certainly not this one!::Ben::1.0::November 27, 2012
R2NCR79UIK52O1::Returned for Repair within the first year::I ordered and received this product in early 2012. Everything has been great with it until recently the screen started blanking out and turning completely white. I had to send the unit back to Acer at my cost. The repair is now complete and the laptop is working fine.I like everything about this laptop. Its fast, quiet, lightweight, and a good price. This review is just a warning to others, there can be issues.::Jeremy::4.0::September 1, 2012
R1LSBTPBZI4BOI::Linux On Acer s3::When you want to have a Fedora linux on it.When Acer S3 has a broadcom chip for wifi BC4313 (some models has a Atherous), linux works poor for this chip.You must install rpmfusion repos from, and after "yum install kmod_wl".Also problem with bloothoot on same chip. some problem also on SD card reader.Laptop is good on windows.::Pbero::4.0::July 24, 2012
R3DGL77BA24MBA::Good value::Pros: lightweight, fast, good display size, good keyboard sizeCons: touchpad, a bit tippy, keyboard layoutI bought this to replace an HP ProBook, which is a good machine. Beats HP in all respects except touchpad; Acer chould have chosen better touchpad. Connects effortlessly to Wi-Fi. Keyboard very good but could benefit from larger arrows. Battery life is good on low brightness; not so good when higher. Tippy unless you keep all four feet on the surface. But a good buy and well worth considering if you need to carry a computer around.::vvs49686::4.0::March 6, 2012
RG3QPZYR25C0::Fantastic, except for the touchpad::As a whole, I absolutely love this laptop (or "ultrabook").  It is incredibly light, stylish, and comfortable to use . . . except for the touchpad.  I found the default touchpad driver to the best, however.  I downloaded other drivers, but they made the problem worse! The problem for me is not scrolling with two fingers, but rather with the "buttons"--specifically, the left button (the buttons are embedded in the pad like the newer macbooks).  Often I find myself, by accident, clicking as I am scrolling (I will accidentally highlight text, for instance).  Strangely, this problem is not constant. It is very erratic.I hope that Acer is able to come up with updates that reduce all the problems associated with the touchpad.Would I buy this product again?  Absolutely.  The touchpad is the only drawback.  But, it really isn't THAT bad, and I'm sure that I will get more comfortable/adjusted to it.  And, I have a wireless mouse, which I prefer to use.::ohnowtf::4.0::January 20, 2012
R22AP7MOCCJUGQ::Look no further for a thin Windows 7 laptop::The laptop does not show any traces of fingerprints, the screen is very crisp and clear and the keys are very responsive and comfortable. It has a great touch pad (very smooth and responsive like a macbook), and boots up fast. My only cons is that it's battery life is a bit poor. Also, the up/down/left/right keys are small (so you'll probably want an external mouse.Acer builds a solid computer so if you want a Mac look-alike without the mac price this is a great pick.::Stevil::5.0::January 10, 2012
R1MXB1E47U9OPH::Great product::This laptop is definitely the best one I have tried in a while. I was looking for months for a laptop that had the similar specs as the Mac Air. This laptop is really lightweight, fast, and easy to use. You will not be disappointed. The only thing is I wished it had a CD drive but those are cheap to buy online.::Amazon Customer::5.0::December 27, 2011
R2Z9ET53I5GPVU::A very good Macbook Air alternative::This is a very good alternative to the Macbook Air. It may not have the aluminum feel like the macbook air but the plastic actually does not feel so bad. It's actually nice and different. For the price, this is an amazing buy.The screen may look smaller compared to the Air but that's because the screen has an aspect ratio more closer to 16:9.::Anshuman Bhuyan::5.0::November 18, 2011
R1L986CC8AF85X::S3 has issues look before you leap::Update:The Bluetooth hardware was in the machine. The help desk person (level2) did not know how to start it. The next helpdesk person did and it took a second to get Bluetooth working.One month into using this computer. Like it. Works as per specs. Miss having a display port for projectors. Wishlist: more harddisk. (end Jan 2012)-----Purchased this about a week ago. Seems  faster than other i5 CPU comparable products and that's the good part. Purchased themodel that sells for around $850. I am technically oriented and have been using computers for over 25 years.Here are the problems I faced.A) No blue tooth hardware in the machine. Tech support says that in their internal documentation the Bluetooth is not supposed to be in the system, but all the specs say that there is Bluetooth. Level 2 tech support agrees that there should be Bluetooth but " engineering" is closed till 3rd jan and they will figure out why Bluetooth hardware is not there in my laptop.B) the laptop has only a HDMI output. So you need to buy an adapter extra for connecting to projectors that have a VGA input or to monitors that have a VGA input. I purchased an HP adapter (see HP's website). Worked fine with projectors (Dell) but did not work with Acer external monitors.  Purchased an HDMI to DVI cable and that worked fine with acer monitors.Wish Acer had given a mini display adapter or some such similar output to connect to VGA input devices such as projectors and monitors.  My fear is that the HDMI to VGA adapter will not work on various projectors and I will get stuck in some offsite business  presentation.Be warned that the keys on the keyboard are smaller than normal and may pose a problem to fast typists.::Hiten Patel::2.0::December 24, 2011
R3ITN7D9GTS7RO::Excellent laptot::I found this product great. I owned it for 1 week now and it works nice and smooth. My only wish is it had more accesories available yet (like HDMI to VGA cable), but I think its just a matter of some weeks until they become available.::Rainer::5.0::October 27, 2011
R2H192OUP7D7IK::Be aware - laptop has defects and technical support is inefficient::This is written 3 months into using the computer. The laptop broke down unexpectedly one day, it has booting problems. I issued a repair case with Acer, they did not email me shipping instructions until I contacted them again a week later. I shipped the laptop away with FedEx and had to pay shipping out of my own pocket because even though it's under warranty, Acer does not pay for shipping to its repair center because "the inbound shipping cost is not covered by Acer's standard (limited) warranty". I used to own an HP laptop and when that laptop broke down, HP took care of everything fast. In contrast, Aver is really inefficient. I do not know when I'm getting my laptop back and whether I would have to pay more for problems not covered by warranty. Hope Acer doesn't give me more headaches in the future.____________________I bought this laptop right here from Amazon. The complaints about bad customer service and defective parts on this site did scare me off at one point, but I've given full consideration and compared it with many other ultrabooks, I believed Aspire S3 was the best of them all and had to give it a try. It's been only three days since I received the laptop so it is still in early stage of experiencing the device, but I gotta say I LOVE it.I really like the exterior design. It looks a lot like a Macbook Air, only a shade dark (the picture on this site makes it look light silver, but it's really not, it's a much darker silver/grey). I really like the touchpad so I hope it doesn't stop working one day.The small arrow keys are not a problem for me. The only key on the keyboard that I always miss hit is the Backspace, it seems to be so far out, and I do think the keys on the keyboard are a little widespread. But I guess I can always get used to it.Another minor problem I've noticed was that sometimes when I click something, it doesn't click, I have to click harder the second time to make it work. I keep thinking maybe it's that I clicked too light the first time, or maybe it's the laptop's problem. But because it doesn't happen frequently and the most I need to do is click twice, I don't think it's a big deal.Three days into using it, so far so good. It was very easy to set up; I deleted all the software that came with but I'm not interested in; the screen was very bright (I had to turn it down below half brightness because it was THAT bright);the battery lasts a long time even when I was watching movies on Netflix._______________________________________________________Now I've used the laptop for a week, I realized it's got a bigger problem.The internet keeps disconnecting, that happens quite frequently, like 5 times a day, even though every time it recovers on its own within half a minute, but what's the deal? My old laptop never disconnected in the house ever.Also, why did the price drastically dropped lately? When I purchased it it was $780 and today it's $740. This makes me consider a refund.::Cici W.::2.0::June 4, 2012
R3B3VQI7AV2MML::i got a defective unit::it is unfortunate that i've had similar problems with alex (1 star review)it was a nice and light laptop. thin, sleek. many people complain about the cheap feel or (see youtube) build but this wasn't an issue for me. i really really liked it.unfortunately, the first issue was wifi connectivity. within an hour or two of usage at home, my connection cuts off so i had to restart my laptop. the funny/weird thing was that ever since i had connectivity issues with my laptop, my roommate also had connectivity issues (maybe the card transmits and jams the signal? i don't know for sure...) but this was something i could live with. anyway, rebooting the laptop is a very very quick process (no exaggeration)!the second issue was that when i turned it on to watch netflix, my laptop took more than an hour to turn on. previous to this, it was working normally, so what happened was just bizarre to me. windows was trying to fix itself and then it later resumed normal operation. that same night i made sure to reboot it to see if this issue would occur again but to my relief at the time, it was working well again. however, the morning after, the same issue surfaced again. i was advised by the acer support team to perform a recovery; however, this didn't work out so well either. the recovery failed. the os was supposed to be stored within a partition in the hard drive but upon recovery, it couldn't access it anymore. i just didn't want to go through the hassle of buying the cd and a cd drive to try to fix something that got broken within a month.if you are the owner of a working acer aspire s3, that's great. it's just unfortunate that i received a defective product.::bianca::1.0::March 30, 2012
R2TKOJ2ANI4PL7::Hard Drive died after 12 months::Bought this because it was very light and portable.  Ran really well and fast but hard drive needed replacement after 12 months costing an additional £100.  I wouldn't buy again but invest that extra £100 in a better more durable machine.::Mr. A. Burrell "Buz"::3.0::March 21, 2014
R1SI819ZUDQ2TH::nice but...::when i bought it was perfect. the size is exactly as I wanted it and as I saw it on catalogue. Everything were perfect till the date the screen just went off with no reason. I think it fragile and may be i did take that into account when transporting and using it...anyway, I had to buy a new screen and pay $150 more...::Abou Munyabahigi::4.0::March 2, 2014
R2SKTMTD081Z33::Acer's quality sucks::This is a piece of crap, breaking down 18months after purchased, and warranty expired.  Upon checking, it turns out many people have the same problem, that is White Screen cause by a cheap LCD cable, which by the way cause $120 to replace.  Don't buy this garbage.::Oh Yeah::1.0::October 7, 2013
R2J0Y1KH3SI6R5::Work well but very noizy whe VIP, SSD broke in one year::I use this model since August 2012.  The pro's are: (1)fast, (2)light,  great for travel.  Con's are: (1) very noisy when I use it on Skype or QQ (voice on IP). (2) One key sometime does not type well. (3) solid state drive has been replaced just before the warranty was going to expired (4) Battery storage time now becomes as short as ~1 hours.::Youngwt::3.0::September 12, 2013
R3AB7LGLKLJRB9::Highly portable::Couldn't be happier with this product, it's like carrying a magazine around.  Wish it had a CD drive but I realize that's not feasible with its very compact size.  Recommended.::Atticus Rex::5.0::July 29, 2013
RAYG1FVTF5HBC::Great laptop.::This is my first laptop.  It's great.  If anything - I wish the battery lasted longer than 2.5 hours I average.::Michael Malak::5.0::May 13, 2013
R2I69HG39D98GM::Will DIE after a couple of months::I had this machine for 8 months and everything was going well. It had decent speed and overall performance even when using multiple programs at the same time, like web browsers, Adobe Photoshop, and InDesign. People also always gave it compliments for having such a sleek and beautiful design. HOWEVER, near the end of its 8th month, it just crashed and the screen turned black. It wouldn't turn on. It was such a pain to have someone figure out what was wrong with it. In the end, the battery was FRIED, and since the battery isn't user-replaceable, it was IMPOSSIBLE to find a new one. I gave up on it and got a new LENOVO laptop instead. BEWARE, you WILL have problems and you WILL experience how stinky Acer's customer service is.::Renevee::2.0::April 26, 2013
R1TH9DI8IMXNNK::Disappointed!!::Sleek, lightweight, easy to use. Really liked the size and features, but from day 1 had issues with the power cord being loose and wouldn't consistently charge the battery. A year after purchase, dropped laptop 2 feet onto carpet and screen cracked, took it in for repair and found out cable that connects screen to base also in poor shape (apparently a common problem with this laptop per computer repair place), so after 1 yr use had to replace laptop. Expected more for the money I spent. Disappointed in the issues. Acer customer service won't even talk to you if past product warranty. Very disappointed with this purchase!! Bought a different brand today, after having been a loyal Acer customer.::Darla::3.0::March 19, 2013
RO8SRDOPJHUWO::Could not be any more dissatisfied.::I went through numerous RMA's and send back to Acer for repair.  I had nothing but trouble with each person I dealt with with Acer and the place I purchased this (newegg)  I had always had good luck with newegg before and since.  But this unit kept getting hot.  It did absolutely no gaming without overheating.  They kept saying it must be a bad unit, but they never fixed it, and they never offered to replace it.  I have gotten maybe 20hrs use out of it so far and the warranty is almost out now.  I will never buy another Acer computer again.  Sorry for the rant, good luck if you purchase this unit.::Beechnut::1.0::March 13, 2013
R11KVM374OUJYY::DON'T BUY ---- Blue Screen of Death::Times like this you wish Amazon would allow you to give ZERO STARS.  Right after warranty expired I started to get 2 to 3 blue screens of death per day.  Acer would not help --trying to get any support from their website is an exercise in frustration.::S. arsenault::1.0::January 24, 2013
R10CORQZV02EKC::For the price, it will do::I purchased this computer a year ago after my other computer's screen blacked out on me.  At first I was really in love with this computer.  It is ultra fast and very lightweight.  I'm a soldier and I travel a lot so being able lightweight is a must for me. However after having it for a year, I've noticed that sometimes while doing my homework the screen frequently freezes, I'm unable to type anything, and sometimes when I completely shut down the system, I will get a blue screen and have to allow my computer to go through the safe-mode method to reboot itself.  Other than those issues, I'm still somewhat satisfied with this computer.My main purpose and use for this computer is schoolwork, so with that being said I am able to get my work done and it does serve its intended purpose. I would suggest if you want a better sound to use a bluetooth earpiece or some earbuds, otherwise the factory speakers suck.  As for the wireless card installed in the computer you have to play with it for a bit and eventually it will stop kicking you off the internet.Make sure you have some type of virus scan on this computer.  I'm not really sure why but it seems that this computer is prone to viruses.  I won't make any suggestions but it does come with a 30 day trial of McAfee that you can purchase at a very good price due to the deal they have with ACER.Again overall I am fairly pleased with this computer.  This is my first ACER product and I hate to say it, it may very well be my last.  I don't hate it, but I can't say that I really love it.  Do your homework and make sure you make the purchase that best suits your needs.  I would suggest this as an excellent first computer for your child that is in school.::enivey::4.0::January 18, 2013
RTFWTYTRVDDAQ::The Good, The Bad and The Ugly::Ok. First of all let me say that I went from an Ibook G4, a heavy clunky dinosaur, to this modern ultra lightweight computer. I really like the computer a lot, I had to relearn how to use a pc after having a Mac for so long, but I do really like it. It fast, I like the track pad, and it's easy to navigate. I have had no problems with the software other than my computer does freeze up a bit more than I would like, and it shouldn't since it's brand new, so that's pretty annoying. I don't look at porn on my computer, and I have a registry cleaner, good firewall, antivirus, blah blah blah.  The bad thing about this computer is that the battery doesn't last long AT ALL. Maybe an hour, maybe an hour and a half. This is the problem I had with my Ibook, which is why I got rid of it, but with a sleek, light computer, I guess they have to cut the bulk somewhere. They have also cut the bulk in the speakers, which are not loud AT ALL. Yes, I COULD buy external speakers, but I don't want to have to.  So that's it from a non computer geek girlie that received this as a gift from her loving boy. It's a really nice computer, totally worth it for the money.::Gieshadoll::4.0::December 20, 2012
R2BCZXFB92V7SJ::what you anouce::In the product description it says battery life goes up to 6 hours and it normally runs out with only 2 to 2 and a half hours.::Dr Alfonso  Riascos::4.0::October 25, 2012
REISZTCMQ1DJ3::Your budget Ultrabook::Okay, first let me get some things out of the way.I'm a techie who loves computers, but also tries to save a lot.  I actually purchased this ultrabook for very, very cheap from a Staples clearance, so I'm probably happier than most for this.I basically needed a light, portable laptop with sufficient processing power that I could bring to college - and for this purpose, this is PERFECT.But I would say that this Ultrabook doesn't give the "full" ultrabook experience.  As always, you get what you pay for.My review has a theme - and that is, its a great ultraportable, but not the premium experience you might expect from an ultrabook.Screen - Its merely decent.  Its not the worst I've seen, but far from the best.  I'm hoping next year we will see IPS displays standard.  Viewing angles are not very good, but decent enough so that you don't have to constantly adjust.  I expect this category to improve a lot in future ultrabooks.  For the price, I'm satisfied.  However, there IS an issue with the screen wobbling.  The hinge is simply too weak for this!  I've tried many other ultrabooks and they have far sturdier hinges.  Acer really needs to improve this, as the screen can jiggle constantly if it is not on a perfectly steady surface.Processor - Fast.  You don't really need to worry here, unless youre trying to do graphics/video processing.  Its very speedy for browsing/word processing/youtube.  Although its a last-gen i5, the newer gen isnt THAT much faster (Ivy bridge is just a die shrink of Sandy bridge + better graphics)Keyboard/trackpad - While other reviewers had gripes here, I actually LOVE the trackpad and find the keyboard fine.  The trackpad is programmable so you can do quite a bit with it.  I find it responsive, accurate, and fairly smooth.  Its not glass (but plastic), so its not super smooth like some other ultrabooks, but its good enough.  As for the keyboard, I also find it to be a nice typing experience.  The key travel isnt much, but its better than some other ultra thin ultrabooks, and sufficient once you get used to it (and this is coming from a person who uses a mechanical desktop keyboard).  I applaud Acer on their design here, as I find both the keyboard and trackpad to be of fantastic quality for a ultrabook in this price range.Battery life - Disappointed here.  I expect next-years ultrabooks to last much, much longer.  It only lasts about 3-4 hours depending on your usage.  I would like to see 6 hours minimum on high brightness levels/usage.. 3rd gen Ultrabooks are going to be spec'd minimum at '9' hours, so I'm expecting to buy another ultrabook next year.  As for their claim of 6 hours, that is pretty much if you have WiFi off and edit a word document on the lowest brightness settings.  Otherwise I could not see it happening.Build quality - Is fine.  Better than your average notebook, but worse than many other ultrabooks.  In general, it feels as sturdy as a regular notebook.  I found no flexing that would bother me.Noise level - This is actually my main problem here.  This ultrabook can get irritating in a quiet bedroom.  The fan spools up and has a high pitched noise, even when doing web browsing.  This is one part that really needs to be addressed.  This and the battery life is why I docked a star.To summarize, I gave this 4 stars because while it is imperfect, I don't expect perfect for the price of being the cheapest ultrabook on the market.  1 full star was docked because the fan has a high pitched noise, and the battery life should be at least 5 hours according to ultrabook spec, but it isnt.::Ro::4.0::October 7, 2012
R2VTX80US3EEPX::Trackpad problem::The trackpad was unresponsive at times, getting the right click was tedious, I returned it because of that. despite that the machine has a beautiful design, ultra portable.::Ivan Aguilera::2.0::May 8, 2012
RK8AQMTUUF7VS::Great::Great laptop for me especially compared it to air. light, long battery life, fast, high value. So choose it. and i think it's also a great value to students who can take it to every class.::pennycakes::5.0::April 6, 2012
R20UMSVWM4Y87K::Great laptop::I've been using this product for the past 2 months and it is PERFECT! Totally go for it; elegant look, fast and extremely light.::pen::5.0::April 5, 2012
R297RV6EM6SBBV::Fantastic, thin, and light::I first spotted this laptop being used by a classmate, I thought it was a a MAC.  When I seen that it was an Acer I had to look the prodcut up to see what pc was being made that looked so stylish and thin.  The weight was a big issue to me in looking for a computer beccause with carrying loads of books and notebooks around I wanted something light. I read product reviews and did my research for approximately two weeks. Being that weight and size were an issue to me, I read every review I could.  Not to discredit anyones views but I do feel some are a little over the top in things they do not like.  The review about the charger being 4 lbs is just not accurate in my opinion.  The charger is only slightly bigger than that of a netbook charger.  It is also not that heavy either in comparison with traditional laptop chargers.  This one could fit into my purse comfortably and I not know it.I am giving this review five stars despite it getting an Atheros wireless adapter malfunction in the beginning.  Microsoft will tell you that it is up to date in the Device Manager ,but apparently not.  If one is to get this error you have to go to the Acer website and download the update for it, which relaly isn't that hard. This is a spectacular laptop for those on a budget or just not wanting to drop $1000-1500 on a laptop.  I think for the price it is a great laptop.  For basic needs such as internet, email, papers, and presentations tihs laptop will fit your needs.  It's fast, thin, and comfortable to type on.  he arrow keys are a bit small but I cannot imagine who uses their error keys that much were it would pose a problem::Eclectic_Libra::5.0::April 4, 2012
R26Q0331JWT65L::love the portability. keys could improve::This is great for portability. It runs relatively fast and smooth. Battery life for me is around 7 hours. What I'm most impressed with is that this netbook doesn't get too hot like my other laptops. Normally, when I am on my other laptops for hours, they would get really hot so I'd have to put a fan under them. With this ultrabook, even when I'm streaming Netflix videos for hours, I only gets slightly warm, not hot. The only con I  have for this ultrabook is that the keys are placed in a way where it's uncomfortable to type and I also miss keys when typing.::mi::4.0::March 27, 2012
R1MLSKAPIZJC9O::I LOVE IT::Just beautiful,I have to mention that yes you need to press a little hard the touchpad but it's not a big deal for me.If you think you ca wait for the window 8 by October than wait for it but you can always install it on this ultrabook.::Amazon Customer::5.0::March 13, 2012
RSZI2A6CZY48O::Really nice laptop, very thin and light. (Returned to Amazon today)::Today, I had to return this Acer ultrabook to Amazon, and have ordered a Toshiba Portege Ultrabook. Two days after I began using the laptop, the trackpad began acting rather erratically. The pointer would jump suddenly or get stuck on one corner of the screen. The trackpad would then become unresponsive and I'd have to wait a couple of seconds before I could use it again. I really rather liked the feel of this ultrabook; it felt sturdy. But the trackpad's lack of responsiveness started to really get to me after a while. I'm not sure if other folks have had this experience, but I had wanted so much to keep the laptop and had hoped that the trackpad thing was just a glitch. So I hung on to it for a few more days, thinking it would go away. And it would, for a while, and then return. I must've gotten a lemon.-----I just received this laptop today. These are my first impressions. (I'll update my review as I start using the unit for classes this coming week.) The laptop is very thin; yes, it's less than an inch. I'm typing on my i5 Toshiba satellite right now, with the Acer sitting next to it and the difference in thickness is amazing. The laptop is also very light and though it has a little bit of that "plastic" feel to it, it's still a rather beautiful machine. There's just a little hint of heat on the left underside, but it's definitely tolerable. It does wake up quite fast when you open the lid, most of the ports (two 2.0 usb and 1 hdmi) are at the back (the earphone jack is on the left side and the SD card slot is on the right). Like one reviewer said, the SD card slot doesn't allow the card to slide in completely, so it's left sticking out. I guess one will just have to be mindful of the fact if a card is left in there. I'm not sure yet about how long the battery lasts as I just turned it on about an hour or so ago. The keys are good, except the arrow keys which are a tad too small for me, but again, it's not going to be a problem. The trackpad is just one big square, no separate left and right buttons. It was tricky using it at first, but you get used to it after awhile. The screen is glossy; again, not a big problem for me, though I know some folks who prefer non-glossy screens. The size of the screen is quite good, not too small, not too big. [At this point, the only thing I'm not liking is the bloatware - hence the 4/5 stars - which I'm going to slowly work on to remove of course; plus the fact that the hard drive which is supposed to be 320 gb only actually shows up being 280 gb. Now I know a lot of it is used for necessary computer software and whatnot, but that's an entire 40 gb that I can't seem to account for. (Again not a very big problem as I don't intend to load a whole lot of stuff on the computer as I just need it for travel and library/research purposes; still, if someone could help clear this up for me. I just want to know why this seems to be more particularly pronounced with Acer products. The Toshiba's I've used don't seem to have as much as 40 gb "missing" or "unaccounted" for when you buy them. Anyone who can help clarify this? Thanks!]Will update my review as I continue using the laptop over the next few days and weeks. But for now, so far so good. I'm liking it.::Amazon Customer "Philos"::4.0::February 8, 2012
R1KPG0U0UTDJXF::Go with a competitor...any other competitor.::For $800 this was the worst purchase I have ever made. The quality of this ultrabook is complete s***. I honestly wish I would have paid $200-$300 more to get a higher quality ultrabook. Where to start....the sound quality is awful, and at full volume is not very loud so you will always need earbuds. The picture quality is terrible, if I take a picture of myself or chat with someone on skype it is noticeable that the picture is unclear and the color is distorted as if there is a filter on it. After one month of use the finish on the keys had already started wearing off and the mouse pad started sticking on one side. The display half of the ultrabook wobbles so much while you type it will make you dizzy. And the build is just plain cheap...there is a strip of black plastic at the connection between the display and the keyboard parts that has already cracked right in the middle...nothing happened so I guess it was from simple handling.The product looks really nice when you see it online...but when you take it out of the box you might be disappointed, and with a couple of months of use you will surely be really disappointed. Get something else.::Corinne B. Hummel "Crinzle"::1.0::December 30, 2012
R13XHMKFK11M0O::excellent::It is really a great laptop with wonderful price. and the performance is fabulous with i5 CPU.the weakness is that the RAM is non-upgradable = ="::Dennis Chang, L.Ac.::5.0::April 10, 2012
R2YIH76PILME5Z::Frustrating::I wanted to like this computer.  I really did.  The amazingly thin profile, the light weight, the aluminum cover--all very, very nice.  The keyboard is pretty good, and it is certainly quick to start up.That being said, this little machine is so frustrating that I will be returning it.  Here's why:1) The touchpad is atrocious.  If you don't start your swiping motion precisely in a small area at its center, the touchpad will either execute a click command, or it will simply ignore you altogether.  Frustrating.2) The touchpad also has a weird delay to it.  Swipe from the correct spot on the touchpad and you'll still have to deal with a nice relaxing break before the arrow begins to move.  Frustrating.3) All the talk about how easy it is to connect the S3 to a wireless network?  Bull.  Unmitigated bull.  I've spent the last 3 days attempting to get online with it, but no success.  I've got 2 other Windows 7 machines getting along nicely with my network, but the Acer is having none of it.  Frustrating.4) Acer is apparently not standing behind this computer.  Chatting with a technical support rep, I was informed that the wireless connectivity problems I continue to experience are not hardware-related, and therefore Acer will not be helping me with them unless I give them more money.  Yes, it was put that baldly.  Inexplicably, as of this date, Acer's website does not offer any drivers for the S3.  When asked about this small oversight, the Acer rep simply denied that this was indeed true.  Fine, Acer, you win.  I'm returning your well-designed paperweight, and you can figure out what to do with it from there.::The Inveterate Scofflaw "J"::2.0::January 2, 2012
R1EE20O5IIASZW::By itself it is okay but not worth more than 300 dollars.::I bought this laptop at an insanely nice price from staples when it was on clearance. I replaced the hard drive with a solid state drive, replaced the terrible wireless card and the sub par fan. I luckily spent only $100 dollars on these extra parts on black Friday. The laptop I paid $210 for at Staples. It runs incredibly with all of the new updates but with the factory wireless card, you are going to have some troubles.The wireless card: Drops signals randomly and will not work until you reboot the computer.The hard drive: I put it in an extra external hard drive enclosure and it died on me within four months.This computer is not worth it unless you understand how to upgrade a laptop. The parts are cheap. But for the price I bought it for such a small and light laptop I cannot complain.::Samuel::3.0::January 12, 2013
R3S12AIAE77SRO::Works good so far::Everything seems to be working fine.  The internet card seems ok so far.  It's a bit smaller than I thought.  There is no CD drive which I do not like because you won't be able to watch movies or anything like that.::LemonGrass::4.0::April 10, 2012
R2NL81OTF50WPU::Dead after six months::I enjoyed my S3. It was so much more portable than my old, big laptop. That was in the past tense because my S3 just wouldn't start this morning. No lights, nothing. Dead. It is less than six months old. To have a computer fail after six months is a sign of poor quality to me. Sending it to Acer for repair. I fully expect that they will find something that gets them off the hook from doing the repair under warranty (I'm sorry sir, but you were using your S3 while breathing. That is clearly a violation of the warranty terms.) I hope they prove me wrong.::bigprivacyfan "bigprivacyfan"::1.0::April 12, 2012
R3BH1GCDZY3TON::Junk, broke in two months::I bought one from staples for less than %600 and thought it was a good deal. However, its hinge broke after a bit over 30 days. Now I cannot return it. They have no local technical services. You have to mail it in and there is no guarantee they will fix it: they often make up excuses to avoid their warranty. So I am afraid.::L. Liu "linda_w_liu"::1.0::February 22, 2012
R215TFIZB083KM::Nice design, but with performance limitations::It is a beautiful slim computer, but performance is not the best. I have one since December 11 and I'm not happy with it. The ultrabook usually overheats, specially when using videos. When it overheats, the computer goes slow, or even stop to work, what is ridiculous for a new computer. The fan is noise, usually running at maximum speed. The HD also makes some sound.The battery is fair for the size (~3 hours), but I miss my old Acer 4810T (~6 hours). The touch pad is not the best, the keyboard is ok. Definitely the S3 is not even close to a Mac Air. It is a nice computer for travel (size and design), but to pay ~ $ 800 for a "netbook" is ridiculous.Pros: Beautiful, slim.Cons: Easily overheat, that makes it lose performance, and the fan makes a annoying sound.Don't spend ~ $ 800 on this. Buy a ultrabook with full solid state hd (less noise, more performance). Be careful with overheating on these small computers, it kills performance.::Daniel::2.0::June 16, 2012
RTE0MZ5KBROWV::Keyboard and mouse pad  unusable::What a major led down.  I saw mostly rave reviews here and decided to give it a try.  There's really no point to go into the positives if the most basic functions like the keyboard and mouse pad are not usable.Keyboard:I read about the potential "getting used to" on the keyboard but didn't realize it's that bad.  Certain keys would not register UNLESS you have to be precise on the where your fingers land on the keys.  This seems to affect certain keys on the keyboard.  So imagine if you're a fast typist like me and constantly second guessing yourself on which key you hit and or you will need to constantly go back to correct yourself.  This is just insane. If you havfe carpal tunnel syndrome don't even consider this laptop. The keyboard was so bad that I had write this review on my desktop, it was just that frustrating.Mouse Pad:The mouse pad is a single piece design and it's integrated with the left and right button.  The problem is that it's big enough where you accident hit the right side and right click appears accidentally.  Seems to be better with the tap click featured disabled but it's not really a true solution. Also, mouse clicks is not as sensitive as it should be so you need to press harder.  I found highlighting text very difficult and you have pay extra attention to get the job done.Other issues (not a showstopper but I personally didn't' like)Build QualityThe build quality is on the cheap side, so look like an Apple Mac Air it's certainly doesn't feel like one.  The case shell feels more plastic than alloy. If you seen the Mac Air you can easily feel the difference.  Granted the Air book is about double the price of this ultrabook so just want to clear up some expectation.Screen resolutionDepending on what you used in the past this may or may not be a problem for you.  At first I thought the resolution won't be an issue since it's a smaller 13.3" inch screen and found the display space is not adequate for my needs using the native resolution/lcd size combo.Screen viewing angleIt seems like I have play with the view angle on this laptop more to get it right otherwise it's appears to be washed out towards the bottom of the screen.  This is annoying since it's not the normal viewing angle and you have to push the LCD more back to get it right.Sound systemIs this just a gimmick with this "Professional" tuned Beat Audio thing?  I found the sound horrible almost sounding like mono.  I have a 5 year Lenovo T61 with better audio.  Perhaps this is due to the fact the the speakers are at the bottom of the laptop which makes it sound muffled.  This is also a horrible place to place the speakers.  Why not place facing you at the LCD?I paid $599 for a refurb shipped.  I would probably kept it if it weren't' for the keyboard and keypad.  This is the basics for any computer, how could Acer screw this up (so bad)?::S. Lim::1.0::May 20, 2012
R1W2Z0HJCEWDUA::Love it::This book is almost exactly what I was looking for in an ultra. Its light, thin, perfect screen size and rez, has an HDMI port, two usb 3.0s, fast-enough dual-core i5 1.6GHz, and 4Gigs ram. Came with Windows 7 which I immediately blew off as I needed this rig for my Linux work. There's another sticking point, but it has nothing to do with Acer, the Windows ransom. Fortunately for me I found a display model at a cut rate, so I sort of circumvented that. For a non-scientific speed benchmark I ran Half-Life Deathmatch (which is now available for Linux, yes) and it ran plenty playable. There are of course a few drawbacks; my biggest is the 4 Gigs of DDR3, its soldered on to the board and NOT upgradable. That almost blew the deal for me, but I liked the cases' form factor so much I went for it. Others have complained about the keyboard, and they are right, I find myself missing keystrokes occasionally, but I can live with it. One major beef I have is with the battery life, I don't know where people come up with these 4-6 hour capacities, in my experience the real life of the battery is 2-2.5 hours. Pretty darn bad for a laptop. I actually don't have a huge problem with the capacity itself, I would prefer that manufacturers were more truthful, and resellers like Amazon and its partners are obviously just regurgitating what Acer says the specs are. Even after replacing the battery pack with a brand new one, the real life on one charge is about 2.5 hours. That's it. However, if you really like power with thin and light, you could do worse than this rig.::interval::4.0::April 20, 2013
R37OXCGUIMS1KU::Aces and Aspirations - An unexpected winner!::Background Info:After completing my 3rd year of tertiary education (2 of which were wasted in a programme I am no longer pursuing), I decided that for the upcoming year that I needed to spend more time studying at school. My old HP notebook would be too embarrassing to take to school because of the poor condition that I had kept it in, so I needed a more public-ready one. It had been 3 years since my father had bought my last laptop and this time around I wanted to have a say in the choice of laptop knowing that if I had left it up to him, he would have simply bought whatever the retailers told him was 'hot'. This was my first time actually taking an active role in making such an important purchase decision. And because I was specifically buying this product for consumption in public places, there was a need to mix practicality with high amounts of esteem. The unit had to be:1) a brand that my peers would recognise2) polished and of high quality3) 14-inch, no larger4) NOT an Apple product, but could hold its own against it5) light and portable enough to carry around in a backpack6) able to do simple Word-Processing and web-browsing for the leastWith this criteria, I set out in search for the perfect laptop companion. Naturally, because of unsatisfactory experiences, HP was automatically removed from my mental list of options.Decision-Making Process:My first inclination was to get a Sony Vaio. They were readily available and the brand, to me, seemed favourable enough. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to see some Sony models at a local retailer and was not impressed at all by the outward appearance so the desire to get one quickly disintegrated. Prior to visiting the retail outlet, I had heard some talk about this Acer Aspire but purely because of the 'meh' brand name, I didn't even give it any serious thought. However, when I saw it at the retailer's that immediately changed. I loved that it had an aluminium finish and was very light and compact - it was directly out of my dream. Those were all the practical features that I was looking for but I could not bring myself to commit to the brand. To do so would largely betray the reason why I was even going through the trouble of sourcing a new laptop in the first place. Thus, I found comfort in a similar, yet much more elegant-looking Samsung Series 5 NP530U4C-A01US 14-Inch Ultrabook (Light Titan). Further research revealed that the product that I was actually searching for was a new product category called 'ultrabooks' of which both Samsung and Acer offered options.Up until the point of purchase, I debated back and forth on what was the best product for me. At one point, I was even considering substituting a laptop with a tablet-portable keyboard combo (no USB-input being the deal-breaker for that flawed idea). Finally, after viewing ultrabook reviews on Youtube I ended up reaching a compromise. The Samsung Series 5 model had a useless CD drive, was larger and heavier and carried a heftier price tag than the Acer Aspire. I decided that a 13.3-inch display was not significantly less than a 14-inch display and that I could function with the same 2 USB ports that I am already accustomed to. Perhaps the biggest compromise was that I settled for a 'bland' name device. The word 'Acer' doesn't seem to turn heads or conjure up images of superiority or relevance for that matter. But, for what it's worth, the device is more than well-made and fits my aesthetic ideal.Within a week of ordering my Acer Aspire, I had it in my hands.Product Review:Design-The device to me is very aesthetically-pleasing. I love the aluminium finish. To me that signifies a kind of serious classic sleekness. The extreme-thinness of it was the wow-factor for me. I just can't get over the fact of how slim this device is when compared to my HP notebook and even my friends' laptops. However, I don't think 'light' is necessarily the best way to describe this unit though. Holding this in one hand and my HP Pavilion in the other, I can only ascertain a slight difference in weight, much less than I would think there would be. I think a more appropriate term would be 'less cumbersome'. It is made up primarily of metal after all. In any case, it is extremely portable but doesn't appear flimsy. This is what truly matters.Keypad and Touchpad-This is my first time using a keypad with such flat keys ('chiclet' I believe it is called) so I have to adjust. I keep making mistakes, mostly because I don't tap a key hard enough. Hopefully, I will be able to reduce the number of errors as I get more acquainted with it. Potential customers note that the arrow keys are very small and that the 'Fn' shortcuts seem to be limited. For e.g. there is no shortcut to play/pause or stop music playing in the background like there is on my HP. The touchpad is also new to me (I am a mouse person) but I am adjusting very well to it. I like how we don't have actual knobs to the bottom of it.Display-It could be better. I find it hard finding a setting that I like. It's either too bright or too dark.Sound-Pitiful. It's definitely not the concert experience. I will be using this device for school work though, so listening to music or watching movies is not as important.Software-I had the worse experience with Microsoft Office Starter or whatever it is called. The first day I carried my laptop to school, it just wouldn't even open! I remember feeling buyer's remorse but I gave Acer the benefit of the doubt; this was not their fault. A lot of other programs came pre-installed, I believe these are referred to as 'bloatware'. I deleted some of them, only keeping things that I already use like Skype.Other experiences-In order to avoid repeating history, I am making a conscious effort to drain the battery of my laptop every time instead of having it perpetually plugged into an outlet. I am getting good battery life on the laptop right now and it doesn't take  long at all to recharge. But, the device is still in its infancy stage. It's cute and well-behaved now but who knows when it will become stubborn and incorrigible. I am already annoyed by the constant updating of anti-virus programs and the need to restart every other day when Windows has to install whatever, but I guess that is a trade-off of having an efficient device; a kind of necessary evil. It is important to mention that with all the hype about a less-than-2-sec awake from sleep mode functionality, I really don't see a difference in how long the Acer takes to how long my old HP takes. If there is, it's really insignificant to me.Overall:I would recommend this device to anyone. My quips with it are probably personal. I think Acer really created a star product here. It's not perfect but it does the job that I want it to do, and it looks good doing it. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks now. I named it "Athena Amazonia" and I hope that she will serve me well for the next 2 years to come. Only time will tell. I hope that this review will provide persons in a similar situation with some insight.Thanks for reading!::Makeeda Brathwaite::5.0::October 28, 2012
R1RGERVOQCM920::It doesn't worth it.... Bad technical support.::I bought this laptop and after 25 days it started to show some problems in the touchpad and the screen started shaking while I was typing, which is something very annoying. I called the technical and they did not help me so I decided to return this product and I bought a Macbook air, and it was the best bought I've ever made.::camargolucas::2.0::June 20, 2012
R1SVUWSCWEXYMB::Nothing but trouble::I bought this laptop today after looking at it online. Right out of the box, it was nothing but trouble. The automatic update failed to update the usb ports so that nothing I plugged into them worked. I was on the phone with support for almost two hours trying to figure out that I needed new drivers. And Windows 8??? OMG that is the worst program I have ever seen. After spending the day doing things on it, I'm ready to pull what's left of my hair out.But the reason I'll be hauling myself down to the store and begging them to take it back and refund my money is that the power and usb ports are on the back of the machine, not on the side like they are for every other laptop I've seen. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you plan on using your laptop in bed or snuggled up on the sofa, anywhere that your body might come in contact with the back, forget it. It joggles the usb connections, making the attachment continuously unload and reload. The power cord has a small transformer close to the plug and it addition to the cord getting tangled up underneath the computer, I was constantly having the thing sit down wobbly because I sat it onto the desk and the transformer was under there. Continuous PITA to try and remember to pull the cord out of the way before setting it down on a surface. The port placement is completely impractical. The designers obviously didn't try to actually use the thing in daily life.Avoid this thing like the plague!::Von::1.0::December 19, 2012

R7V0G1XUZW3DZ::DO NOT BUY ACER!! Customer service is just as bad a product.::I bought an Acer Aspire Pc 6 months ago and the dvd burner has went out. I spent hours today on the phone with them having me to factory reset my computer (they had to look it up to find out how that was done and I was already in the process of it being restored before they said go to start menu. It took me a couple of hours to remove stuff from my computer to my external (and i probably missed some stuff) plus i have to reload all my programming that the restore deleted. This would absolutely fix my dvd burner.......of course it didn't. Than i had to call back and I talked to another CRS to have him keep repeating (rudely)First he said i had to send my whole computer in, i refused, I had read too many bad reviews of people sending their whole computer in and the company saying it was banged up in transport and they had to have $200 to fix the cosmetic problems before they would fix internal problems. When I refused and asked for a new dvd burner sent to me with a return postage sticker so i could send my old one back he told me I had two options they could take my credit card number and put a hold of $150 and they could send out me out a new dvd burner and if i sent the other one back (like i have use for one that doesn't work) or I could send mine in and they would send me a new one out........I told him that that was unacceptable. I asked for his supervisor and the supervisor (another very condescending and rude person) would only repeat the same thing. I asked to be transferred to his supervisor and was told he answered to no one, and hung up on me. Than i called back and they had me uninstall and reinstall my dvd burner and that was a guarantee fix. It wasn't. I am at wits end what to do. I have read way to many reviews of people sending their stuff in and never getting it back and I will not pay $150 for something that you can buy in the store for around $50 and to top that off the way they run their business i would never give them my credit card number. They are the most unorganized and rude company it has been my misfortune to meet. Do Yourself a favor.......DO NOT BUY ACER PRODUCTS!!!!::EweWish::1.0::August 29, 2012
R1GVZKQAK9BZEM::It may be great new tech at a decent price, but.....::I don't understand why any co. (Yes, I understand this is the "entry" level model, at least in price, for a Windows Ultrabook). My problem is this - All of the hard work to make a thin and beautiful computer, to ruin it all with: USB 2.0 (I mean come on - there should not be such a thing! It's like putting in a DVD player - opposed to an integrated BD Player - on a brand new flat acreen 51 inch, LED, 1080p, 240hz TV). Companies need to lose the eSata combo drive,etc..get with the times and make all ports 3.0 USB & backwards compatible. BT 3.0 is still like speaking a foreign language to most. "Huh? Golly gee, they have BT 3.0?!" Well, now Acer has BT 4.0!; yet, still using USB 2.0, and Regular HDD with a tiny SSD. No wonder it can get 50 days on Standby but only 6 hours (in perfect lab conditions) of continued use. They should havesubstituted it all with a SSD between 100-250 GB. Especially with so much cloud computing. The thing would peobably run 8-10 hours w/o charging and weigh even less.

R3FNIZIP381U85::Disappointed with screen definition...::I was all excited to get the product, and I am happy to see it.I used to have an HP netbook, but I got this Acer Aspire because I dropped the netbook.It is extremely thin - thinner than my HP Mini 210, about as light as mini.I was looking for a lightweight, so I was happy with that when I opened the package.What I am disappointed about is the screen definition. Maybe this is because I am used to the high, good quality definition of my netbook, but cummon, I can probably count the pixels on this. I am pretty up to date with technology, and comparing this to my smartphone screen definition, I feel like I am going back some years to those days when the color screen first came out for phones.I guess I won't be watching movies on this...Dolby home theater isn't that great either. I use a speaker, so that doesn't bother me as much as the screen is bothering me right now (and I can't really help that. I have to stare at it constantly... what am I gonna do..)If you are one of those people like me who think that it is very important for your laptop to have high definition screen, this isn't for you.But otherwise, the specs are good, cheaper compared to other ultrabooks, and I will manage with this.Not the greatest buy though..::allizangel::4.0::November 4, 2011

R9ZNO6QZHU4OD::question::only after looking at the macbook air(cause this one isn't in stores) did I realize that it has no LAN/Network/RJ45 port...so it can only connect wirelessly?  Don't get me wrong it's fine for 90% of what you'll use it for, but what if you need to plug in?  I've been to a bunch of hotels that don't have wireless, particularly overseas.  How do I plug in the LAN cable?  Do they make an adapter?  I know there is an adapter that works with ether net ports(I asked the guy at the mac counter).  The MacAir dosn't have a LAN port and they told me they use an ether net cable.  The S3 only has 2 USB's and HDMI.  I was curious if anyone knows if they make a USB adapter?I was so looking forward to this, its cheap, light, great battery life...perfect for travel.  But, I do a lot of overseas work and if I can't get on the internet its all kinda moot.  If anyone knows the fix to this please comment!::Doug::4.0::October 17, 2011

R69MG4EDRVDE2::Lenovo u300s versus Asus UX31E...The Winner is...::I have waited to get my hands on an ultrabook since Intel basically threw the challenge at PC manufacturers to build something high end that could actually approach the standards that have made Apple so popular. Let's face it, these ultrabooks are in response to the wildly popular Air series by Apple. Companies like Lenovo, Asus, Acer, HP, Sony, have stepped up to the plate and took a swing at it.After having owned an Acer, Asus, Mac, and now Lenovo's ultrabook, I can safely say that in the Windows family of computers, the Lenovo u300s is by FAR the winner over the others. Here is why:1. WiFi - Asus UX31e has a serious problem with its internal wifi adapter. Out of the box, two of the UX31e had serious problems with wifi. I updated the bios, flashed it, you can read about the entire review on the Asus ux31e customer review by me. None of the issues I have had with wifi have occurred with the u300s. In fact, the Lenovo is blazingly fast.2. The Touchpad - Lenovo got it right by using the much better Synaptics pad than Asus who went with an inferior product and it shows. The touchpad on the Asus has required them to release software updates and it still doesn't have the fluidity that this Lenovo has. The pad feels much more rich and the smoothness is on par with perhaps the best experience I have had using a touchpad on a laptop. Even the multi touch features similar to the MacAir are done the best on the Lenovo u300s.3. Keyboard - The Lenovo just feels solid. The keys are brisk and responsive and you actually love typing on it. It makes typing fun if that's even possible. The Asus has shallow keys and I don't mind the Asus keyboard at all but the one on the Lenovo just feels like its a much better quality. The biggest factor on the keys, and its a big one for me, is that function keys are natively computer functions. Meaning, if you want to raise the volume using keys, you don't have to hold the FN key down and then the corresponding action key. So, when I want to raise volume, I just hit what would be F3. This makes a lot of sense because you are much more likely to do things like raise lower volume, adjust screen brightness, mute it with one key strike, etc than use actual function keys. I love this. On the Asus if you wanted to raise the volume, you have to hold down the function key on the left side and hit the raise volume key on the right side. Trying to do this with one hand cause you to stretch that hand nearly all the way from tip of thumb to tip of pinky if you want to reach this functionality. I play music on my laptop and key functionality is a big deal to me.4. Speakers - The Asus does seem to have better speakers. Side by side, the quality of the UX31e speakers seems more full with deeper bass tones. The Lenovo is not bad though and I am very happy with the quality of the speaker on the u300s.5. Performance - both for their own specs seem fine. It's an ultrabook so don't think you're going to be doing much video editing on it. However, for internet, word processing, email, and multi-tasking both are fine.6. Heat - I couldn't use the Asus on my lap after about 15 minutes because the back portion of the laptop gets very hot. I've currently had the lenovo on my lap for the last 30 minutes and its warm but not hot at all. I wouldn't worry about having the Lenovo resting on my lap while I type, even in shorts.7. Webcam - both seemed fine. I tested it out and it may just be me, but google chat seemed more clear with the u300s than the Asus. This could be related to the Asus's poor wifi signal?8. Screen - both are nice to look at. Viewing angles are about the same. No complaints on either one for the screen although when looking closely at them, I dare say that the contrast seems better on the Lenovo. The Asus does have a higher resolution so for those who need that for photos, Asus may be better here.9. Ergomomics - by this I mean typing, using the mouse pad, etc. The edge of the u300s is sharp and if your wrists rests on it for too long, I can see how this could get uncomfortable. I've been typing on it for an hour now, doing emails, etc and I have no problems with it but think others might. The Asus doesn't have this issues because of the tapered nature of it.10. Portability and Ports - I wish the Lenovo had a SD card slot. Alas, it doesn't. The Asus however does. So if you're doing a lot with SD cards, you'll need an adapter for it on the u300s. Both are highly portable. The power supply on the Lenovo is thinner than the Asus and doesn't feel cheap, whereas the Asus feels like it could break if you dropped it.11. Other Considerations - There isn't much bloatware with either. However, you have to spend A LOT more time fine tuning the Asus to fit your style than the Lenovo. The Lenovo in other words just seems to feel more natural right out the box and that's what you should expect in this price range.12. Winner - Lenovo U300s hands down. After going through so many of the first generation ultrabooks from Asus, Acer, and now Lenovo, the U300s is by far the superior machine. Let's put it this way: The Lenovo is an elegant minimalistic design that just feels and screams sophistication and reliability. It's stylish without being so flashy like the Asus. While the Asus gets a lot of "ooooo aahhhh" looks, the U300s is more subtle, like that very beautiful lady in a room that is genuinely stunning because she is confident without being flashy. The Asus on the other hand is like the girl with a lot of flash, trying to get the most attention, but for me was too flaky (just making an analogy, I don't mean any disrespect to any females!).Feel free to comment. I hope this has helped you all in deciding. If you're going to get an ultrabook, go for the Lenovo U300s. I ended up returning my Asus UX31E and Acer Inspire because they just are not in the same category as the U300s. After you experience the Lenovo u300s, you don't even want to type on anything else. Honestly. As a gift, I can tell you the Lenovo would be amazing for anyone who gets it. They will love it.Congrats to Lenovo. If you continue to make quality high end products like this, you will lead in the PC World.Happy Shopping everyone!***UPDATE 11/04/11***Here is a link to another review (with benchmarks) in the Lenovo U300s vs Asus UX31E debate:[check in comments; amazon apparently didn't want the link post here but it is in the comments]Hope this helps everyone pick the ultrabook that's right for them. The U300s just happens to be right for me. Good luck!***UPDATE 11/09/11***Asus has acknowledged the problem and posted this on Amazon in response to the customer reviews of the ASUS UX31E (search for UX31E on Amazon.com and read the customer reviews to see this there):"Please check your Device Manager and verify if the touchpad is Sentelic or Elantech. If it is Elantech, it will show that it is Elantech. If it is Sentelic, it won't show the name but rather will just say General or something along those lines. The latest drivers fix the issues a lot of you are having and you can download the latest drivers from [..link in amazon review of ASUS UX31E...]. When you select the TouchPad download category you will see the latest update for Sentelic and for Elantech.To fix the wireless issue some of you are experiencing, please download the latest WLAN driver from [...link in Amazon review of ASUS UX31E...].Best Regards,ASUS Notebook Support"So there you have it. They have acknowledged that the UX31E has issues unfortunately. It's a beautiful ultrabook. Maybe their 2nd generation of the UX31E will get it right.Also, why have two different providers for their touchpad??? I don't see the logic in this because it confuses customers when they need to update the drivers and they have to go digging through their device manager. This is why Apple understands what customers truly want: a computer that's consistent and easy to use and upgrade. The Lenovo U300s in my opinion is the closest thing to Apple quality for a Windows ultrabook. I sincerely hope Asus listens to what the customers are saying, especially with their wallets.::Buckhippo "Buck"::5.0::October 30, 2011
R2HB9PM30A3IVB::Lenovo U300s Review...not perfect, but almost perfect for me.::First review ever, but the U300s is worthy of a try.Just for some background, this is my personal laptop purchase.  I'm a gadget junkie, but on a budget and look for value. I don't mind paying a little more if it's worth it.  I'm an engineer by profession and was looking for something versatile to be able to use for personal but also powerful enough for work.  I'm also a Windows person who for many years sat idly by while Apple fans have gotten the best hardware.  My alternative prior to an Ultrabook was going for a dual boot of the Macbook Pro 13" to use Windows on it.Been wanting a new notebook for a while, so thought long and hard.  Looked hard for any piece of information I could grab on Ultrabooks.  Waited as long as I could for reviews too.  Unfortunately, I was struck early by the unique looks of the U300s.  Poor reviews of the Acer, and mixed reviews on the Asus UX31 also helped to affirm my decision.I purchased the Core i5/128GB version of the Lenovo Ideapad U300s from Amazon via ABT Electronics.  I actually cancelled a CompUSA order because the ABT price was so much better plus NO TAX!! Shipping was fast.  Delivered in about 3 days.Here's a quick review, it's not a technical review.  Just a mix of likes/dislikes addressing some of my main concerns:1) Overall, very good build quality.  I'd say 8.5/10, as there is some creaking on the palm rests.  I really have to try to make it creak, but creak nonetheless.  Otherwise, very good tolerances, everything is tight and sharp.  Great balance.  Lid opens with one hand (UX31 doesn't even do that all the way).2) I love my Apple desktop keyboard with the number pad, but I really like Lenovo's keyboard.  I've used the Thinkpad keyboards for a while, and really like those too.  The island keys on the Ideapad are good.  If I had to rate them:- Apple keyboard = 9.5- Thinkpad notebook = 8.5- U300s Ideapad = 8.0Trackpad does sometimes get in the way, as it is close to the keyboard.  I'm using F6 to turn it off for right now.It's not backlit, but I've never had a backlit keyboard, so it wasn't a deal killer.3) LOVE the ventless bottom.  I use the laptop in bed, and the ventless bottom was a key selling point.  Machine never gets hot.  I haven't even gotten it too warm.  Fan does go on constantly, but it's hardly noticeable.  Feel comfortable using or leaving on a bed.4) Unit's main body color was darker than I expected.  I have the "graphite grey" version.  The marketing pictures makes it look more silverish (like the MBA) but it's darker.  The lid and bottom are also more of a "greyish brown" color.  I like the colors, but not my favorite, and also not exactly what I expected.  Ironically, it's more in line with and matches the colors of my Nexus One phone.One issue is though metal, the lid and bottom seem to absorb oils from the hand.  No finger prints, but oil.  You can wipe off, but still annoying.5) 128GB SSD is fast.  No benchmarks, but feels snappy.  Cold boot is ~15-20 seconds.  Wake from sleep is as little as 2 seconds and up to 6 seconds!  There have been times where like the MBA, you open the lid (one handed) and it's there on the sign-on screen.  Love that.Yes, it's only 128 GB, but I have broken it out into 2 main partitions, one for the system and the other for programs install and storage.  There are other smaller partitions, including I think the recovery partition.  I'm not messing with those.  Using Spotify for my main music source.  I have all of my photos and pictures downloaded which is about 25GB.  I still have ~30GB to play with on the storage partition.I also have a 750GB USB 3.0/7200 RPM Hitachi Touron Pro external HDD for portable storage.  So between the two, I have plenty and fast storage.6) Screen is 1366x768, which is okay for me.  Over the years, my eyes have gotten worse, so I actually appreciate that it's not too high resolution.  I can attach to my 24" monitor directly via HDMI port.  This was not a deal killer.7) My main gripe is no SD card slot.  Silly oversight on Lenovo's part.  Not a dealbreaker, as I have a USB card adapter.  Not a photographer or anything, but still...so small, Lenovo could have put one in.  It was a big gripe in reviews of their U260 model from earlier in the year.I saw the Asus UX31 at Best Buy today in person on display, and had I seen it before I purchased the Lenovo, I would have considered it more seriously.  Probably a better machine, great build quality (no creaking), great sound.  Keyboard was okay too.Overall though, a happy camper with the Lenovo.  The U300s has it's flaws (no SD card, and honestly wish it was a little lighter colored), but almost perfect for me.  Love that it's a Windows machine and looks more akin to a Macbook Pro than an Air, which I appreciate, but < 3 pounds.I plan to keep this little guy for a while.There are very good professional reviews out there which you should check out.  Here's a list compiled by Ultrabooknews.com- [...]- personally, I've read the Mobile Tech Review, Engadget's and The Verge's reviews.Happy hunting.::Fernandez::4.0::November 14, 2011
RO2ZCBTMJGU7P::Wish it was built better::This is a belated review. I was really looking forward to the U300s and got one on amazon as soon as it was available.I really really liked this laptop, but one day after lifting up the screen, I found the display no longer worked. There were strips running along the screen that were now whited out. After looking this problem up and talking to customer support I found that several other people had this same issue due to the fragility of the screen. It basically has to be lifted only in the center and if you lift off center you risk bending the screen enough to break it, even if not that much force is applied.I'll give some of my general impressions as well. The laptop has a great professional look with a thin profile. The screen was bright enough for me but in the sunlight the gloss made it difficult to see. The keyboard was sturdy without much flex although it didn't feel as solid as the old thinkpad keyboards. And this computer is fast. I got the I5 and was quite happy with the startup time and processing speed.In the end I had to return this laptop, and while it has a ton of things going for it, to have a screen that can break that easily is a disappointment. I think being a 1st gen ultrabook it wasn't ready for primetime.::SDNY::2.0::July 5, 2012
R2A6QCQVTHRDNQ::Great laptop if it weren't for the trackpad::UPDATE 3/17/14: The trackpad stopped working within months of purchasing the laptop. After 1.5 yrs the trackpad is getting repaired for the 4th time (going on 2 weeks at the repair center currently), and since the extended warranty is now expired those repairs are no longer covered. I paid over $1400 for a defective computer. Despite this, Lenovo refuses to negotiate a discounted post-warranty or anything else for the trouble I've had with their product from the beginning.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm a student. I use my laptop on a daily basis, mostly for watching video recorded lectures online and accessing PowerPoint, Word, and pdf files. Tried to write a review on Lenovo's website, but they screened it out.Likes:look & designsuper quietdoesn't overheatfast startupgreat keyboardpretty long battery life though decreasing over the year I've had it (that's what batteries do)Dislikes:speakers sound tinny, volume unimpressivetrackpad erratic despite adjusting sensitivitytrackpad stopped working after 5 monthseven after replacement the trackpad still freezes--invariably so when computer is coldno SD port (c'mon, Lenovo. for this pricetag??)the keyboard scratched the screen (I recommend placing a cloth over the keyboard before closing it)Lenovo Tech Support*Bottom line: I like this laptop and could never go back to one that isn't equipped with a solid state drive, but like any computer it's not w/o problems. Except for the trackpad issue they're problems I can live with. An external mouse helped me deal somewhat.*The very first U300s I purchased was defective. I think the fan was hitting the keyboard--sounded like an electric razor in the left corner near the esc key. Lenovo Tech Support infuriated me when the rep told me it was a "customer perception issue" and that was how the laptop was supposed to sound. Ended up calling Lenovo Customer Service and exchanging it for the same model--sure enough, second one was just fine. No buzzing.Trackpad issues were there with both laptops. The mouse spontaneously freezes--only way to fix is to close the lid and open it again (variable success) or use external mouse (always successful). UPDATE 4/17/13 - Trackpad is freezing more frequently. It will have to be sent in for the 3rd time, all three repairs being due to trackpad issues. Upside is they usually fix it and have it back to me within a week. Downside is the problem persists. Glad I got an extended warranty, but it's really annoying that it never seems to be a long-term fix.::JR::3.0::April 1, 2013
R33PQIV8KFGUSV::Worst computer i have ever owned::I have had nothing but troubles with this computer.  the hardware is faulty. I had to take it in for service to get the wifi fixed. i was unable to get on a network.  it also does not have a ethernet port. the mouse pad is horrible in so many ways. the  sensor does not do a good job on picking up the multiple functions like scrolling or pinching. However it picks up your palm while your typing and your mouse jumps around and makes it difficult to type. the mouse also freezes and the computer has to shut down for it to start working. the mouse pad is so bad that i try not to ever use it, just use an external mouse.This is the first lenovo i have owned and the last. I bought it b/c it had a graphic card unlike some of the other ultra books..doesnt matter..the computer is so slow to do simple tasks.  i have rebooted and started from scratch three times so i know it is not my software or virus or anything else that is slowing it down.Compared to the other ultra books this computer lacks a lot of simple but great details. like a backlit keyboard, waterproof keyboard, not as light as the others.  the only thing i like is that it didnt come with a bunch of bloatware like others.::myAmazon::1.0::October 24, 2013
R35579H8BQQ1EM::Sleek Laptop, Miserable Screen::Seriously the screen is horrible, my phone has a higher resolution and the keys leave indentations on the screen from the lid being closed, the pixels are as big as pennies. A problem with the BIOS lead to the "t" key outputting Japanese unicode. Otherwise a somewhat decent laptop.::Nivardus::3.0::November 23, 2012
R3A6YXZ6CISKCP::Lenovo U300 v.s. Apple MacBook::Pretty much the same configuration, except the Mac has higher screen resolution and the flagship multi-touch track-pad, you can make a detailed comparison @ [...]::Lucas Alejan Massuh "lucas"::4.0::November 18, 2011
R10YXL75OBSU62::Solid Performer::This computer appears to be very solidly belt. The keys and touchpad feel solid and well-designed.  The touchpad has very good ballistics.  The screen is bright and clear.  This computer worked very well right out-of-the-box and is  very quiet and fast. It also runs extremely cool, I have not detected any hot air emanating from it despite the large hard drive and fast processor.  All my software installed easily with no hiccups. The performance exceeds my expectations. At the price I paid this computer is probably one of the best laptop values  I have experienced.  This one is a winner.::akakpaws "akakpaws"::4.0::November 18, 2011
R1BFGAM4CP1VYG::Probably my last computer ever::Bought one of these from Fry's ~2 weeks ago. Worked right out of the box w/ easy setup instructions. I am in the age bracket that has been buying a computer, upgrading and then replacing repeatedly for almost 30 years now. I think we have collectively made Mr. Gates wealthy having to do the same thing with software. This is now all the computer I expect to need the rest of my life. It does everything quickly and cleanly and now it sees better and is probably smarter than I am. It certainly can remember more. We have come a long way baby from my first hard drive with only 20MB to the 640GB on this well-configured computer which, ironically, was also the least expensive of the bunch. All I need to do now is keep it clean (thank you Norton), use automatic updates (yeah Microsoft), install another 4GB memory (thank you HP for designing to leave one open slot) and my long love-hate relationship may tip the balance clearly to love.What might make it better? HP and Logitech make a deal to install the transceiver for a wireless mouse\keyboard internally? Bluetooth? All I am sure of is that this computer is pretty sweet for the price.::Spenco::5.0::November 5, 2011
R289ON8OK3REWY::A+ Highly Recommend::I purchased this laptop to replace my bulky six year old HP laptop. My primary use for a laptop is for pleasure, I'm not an avid gamer, nor a programmer. My needs are simple, internet for search functions, office software for work, downloading pictures off the camera, storage of old pictures, movies, etc.My old laptop was repaired twice in the past three years, I could have stretched it out a little longer, but I'm glad I upgraded. The shipping was extremely quick, the package was mediocre (the computer box packaged in an external shipping box with no fragile sticker, no peanuts, nothing to absorb a faulty shipping company. Luckily, the shipping company did not put one dent on the outer box.The battery life thus far has been great, LED screen resolution takes a bit of getting used to from these LCD and plasma affixed pair of eyes, networking is relatively painless, the on-board mouse pad has awesome functionality (zoom-in, zoom-out, two finger scrolling, etc). Keys are easy to use, webcam/microphone built-in is amazing, look is sleek, design is light and easy to transport, the fan output has been routed to the side, so it doesn't heat up your lap, restricting airflow, the dvd drive can be somewhat loud during loading software, but I guess the spin rate is just that high that it creates that type of sound. The average battery lifespan thus far has been three (3) hours fully charged.Great buy for students, working professionals, desktop users who are weary of buying a laptop and for those like me wishing to replace their older laptops with newer and sleeker designed laptop for the general public.::Toronto79::4.0::January 30, 2012
R3LB8UBLCMEHV::TERRIBLE SPEAKERS::speakers broke within a couple of month of use.  also lid is almost half broken.  overall, a very cheap feel. screen quality is also not the best.::Diana::2.0::April 8, 2014
R2IOW7J8N9B8ZX::Love it::HP Pavilion g6 is my first ever personal laptop that I got about a year ago, and I don't think I would ever want a replacement since I am in love with it.We have started to understand each other well. The keyboard is comfortable to use and the touch-pad has features like auto-scrolling, zooming in & out (even the desktop can be easily zoomed in to magnify everything if need arises, perhaps showing something to my uncle who has a poor eye-sight etc. )The pavilion g6 is very user friendly.The reason why I did not give it a five star rating though, is that I have had some problems of getting slight electric shocks through the keyboard while charging. The customer service said it is because the plug I use for charging is not earthed probably, but I have experienced the electric current even when the laptop was not plugged on for charging. Anyhow, it is only occasionally that happens, and since everything else about the laptop is just great (the webcam, the speed, the smooth start-up & shut-down, auto-updates for every thing, great HP support etc.) I'm all happy.::Ayesha::4.0::May 31, 2012
R2TNNKVFXE0WNA::simple y exelente::el equipo es sencillo,  perfecto de todo... bastante completo y rapido. me refiero a sencillo por que es un equipo que lo unico que le falta para ser perfecto es el bluethoo integrado. de resto el equipo es perfecto.::Yasneiri::5.0::February 20, 2013
R2TVXIA2KO7XNP::After Cleaning & Updates, This thing Screams!!!::Having just purchased a similiar laptop with the same exact specs and processor from another manufacturer, I was literally blown away by this laptop's performance.  After uninstalling all the bloatware, downloading the latest bios and drivers from both Samsung and AMD this laptop posts the following WEI...Processor: 6.9 (Just shy of a typical quad-core desktop cpu)RAM: 6.9 (probably due to latency and cpu speed)2D Graphics: 5.9 (far above most on-board graphics)3D Graphics: 6.5 (amazing since it costs $100 or more for a GPU equal to this rating)Hard Drive: 5.9 (standard for any 7200 RPM drive)With all this said, I had to install more RAM and add an SSD on my other laptop to meet this level of performance.  So, I'm very impressed to say the least.Note: To truly see performance gains with this laptop be certain to 1)uninstall all bloatware, 2) update the BIOS and all drivers from samsung.com, 3) use the grpahics card auto-detect from AMD.com and install the latest Catalyst driver, and finally 4) clean the registry.  The laptop will run 20-30% faster than out of the box if you do.::Michael V. Baxter ""Neutrality is a Myth!...::5.0::March 23, 2012
R1SMSK420ARHEJ::powerful... even for games::I chose this laptop because it has the AMD A-series A8 chip... This is a powerful integrated graphics processor for a mid/low-end laptop and I'm surprised just how great a deal this machine is. The game performance is impressive - according to a few reports online (youtube videos and PC harwdare test sites) compared to Intel i3 with integrated graphics it's double in terms of games performance) and it's very fast in Sketchup too. I almost went for the newer model suggested... but that only had an A6 chip... if you need a little extra performance buy this computer, you won't regret it. Speakers are average (ie weak) but not a deal breaker for me. Nice a light, LOVE the fast start feature - that's awesome. Samsung are doing great things.::J. Brookes "Jason B"::5.0::March 3, 2012
R2WJ62QSU8EMFM::Satisfied Linux Enthusiast::All in all, this is a sweet deal!!Yes, it's on the economic side as far as Samsung build quality goes.It delivers on AMD's A8 vision without issues/incident.Running quiet & cool 64-bit (KVM) Linux flawlessly (Kernel 3.x series)On-board components 100% operational!!::Merseph::4.0::January 6, 2012
RG0Q58HX3N62K::Nice buy::Bought this for my 13 yr old son.  He dropped is last laptop to many times.  He can play SWTOR, Skyrim, ME3 and a few other newer games with no problem (and do school work).  It does get hot when playing some games but I have him use one of those fans that plug into the usb port just to be safe.  The laptop he wanted was almost 2k but this will do just fine for a younger teenager.::neum::5.0::May 10, 2012
RWS1U5G3070GO::No real issues with this laptop.::Other than myself wanting a laptop with HDMI In, I haven't had any complaints about it.Touchpad/KeyboardI like the fact that like my previous Toshiba 17-inch laptop, I still have a more or less full keyboard including number pad.The keys are well separated and have more of a Mac feel to them which is good for when I am eating around my laptop which is something I do a lot so I don't get crumbs all inside the keys.The touchpad has a cool feel even after having the computer on for over 3 hours. It has nice large buttons, which makea loud but not distracting click when you push them.Display/OutputsThe screen doesn't show glare even in direct light which is great.It has an HDMI Out port for HDTV display capability and a VGA port for those who would want to setup a second monitor or TV with VGA (which I have used and it works flawlessly)InputsIt has 3 USB 2.0 ports these are good for using mice, cables, or nearly anything with a USB output.A Headphone-In and Microphone-In which is perfect for Skype or listening to pretty much anything on the laptop.Built-in WebcamThere is a built-in webcam, I think it puts out good quality for a built-in camera. But usually I need to turn on the low light compensation because my house has bad lighting at times.Built-in MicrophoneI like that it has a built-in microphone as well. Although I don't really use it as I have a microphone already. It is still good to have that option if some gets messed up.DVD DriveNow onto the disc drive. Yes, the laptop has a DVD burner which I am very happy about, as many computers (especially newer models) are losing the disc drive completely.Operating SystemThe laptop had Windows 7 Home Premium out of the box. Which is great. After about 5 or so months of using Windows 7 I upgraded to Windows 8 and I have not had any real major problems. Other than program compatibility issues and some pre-installed programs randomly deleting from my computer I am not having any problems with the laptop whatsoever.Battery LifeThe battery isn't usually what I use for power but on high performance I was able to get at least 4 hours out of the battery.I haven't tried any other power settings. As I likely run off of the AC Adapter.AC AdapterThe AC adapter which comes with the laptop is perfect, unlike my Toshiba which went through maybe 3 Ac adapters within the 4 years I used it. The plug is great and it isn't separated from it's housing when you plug it in. It stays where it should.I am hoping this will help some looking for a good review.::lilrick110::5.0::April 23, 2013
R10UH415QAXW5I::Best PC i have ever owned::There is only ONE minor detail i can complain about is the touchpad, it kinda comes up on one corner and sometimes interferes with usage, sometimes. Which ALL laptops have crappy touchpads, this has to be one of the better ones(although i use a mouse most of the time for games). as for the way it runs, it does everything i need it to, watch movies, listen to music, play all the pc games i download. it runs really well. even most tower pcs ive had crap out on me when playing certain games. With this i am able to run games at their near highest settings with no lag, Near highest settings because i turn off shadows in games, not really needed IMO. the speakers get pretty loud for a laptop, i hardly ever have it at full volume. I have had it for just about a year so far and it just is amazing :D::Price::5.0::June 10, 2013
R3TKHSOU7HKULR::Temporary Review - General PC User::This is my first day with the laptop. I am just a general user (music, video, MS Office, web browsing), so this is just for the feel/ease of use: - Track pad is nice. Good position and just sensitive enough. It does the Mac scrolling thing (2 fingers). - Feel of keyboard is great for me. I saw some complaints below, but it all makes sense; keys are a good size, it's not squished. I like that there aren't any touch buttons. Those things suck (had some on my HP Pavilion and they rarely worked right). - It never specifies, but the entire computer is matte (including screen) and black - Really fast start up and resume, with that Samsung sleep to wake thing. Seems to work well. - Samsung usually loads its products with tons of crap (I have the Tab too), but didn't do much of that with this laptop. - Comes with an OS recovery CD - Don't know about battery life yet, but other posts have good options for maximizing it. - It does get a little hot, specifically on the left side (right by where you plug in the power adapter). Kinda strange, but maybe it's b/c I'm installing/uninstalling a bunch of stuff right now. It might be that my entire Dropbox has been syncing for a while. - Isn't heavy, definitely not an Ultrabook/Air but good option if you want a 15" screen. Feels compact. - Charging it now, and it's going up pretty fast. - Speakers are nice, nothing fabulous. Sounds comes from a long bar extending across the entire laptop. Doesn't get that loud, but what do you expect...I'll change this review to a 5 if I love it after a few weeks, or knock it down if anything bad happens. Overall, I'd say for under $600 this is a great deal. I can see this thing lasting me a while (I don't game though). Will update later.::Buyer "Buyer"::4.0::June 7, 2012
R1LFBL0NWO3WDL::MY SAMMY::I've had the new Samsung Laptop for two weeks and it is marvelous. Windows 7 is slightly different than Vista so I had to adjust my approach a bit to get my programs & data loaded, but all that went fairly smoothly. No problem with it locating my wireless network; however, I did have to call HP to get the Samsung to recognize my HP printer (had the same problem with my old laptop so it must be an HP thing). Yes, the Samsung start is fast; beautiful color screen; can have several programs open & easily switch among them. My previous laptop was a 17", but I actually like this 15.6" much better. The screen size is plenty big enough for Netflix movies; the laptop is so much lighter & easier to cart around. Someone  mentioned that the zero on the numeric keypad is inconveniently placed directly to the right of the right arrow key. As a bookkeeper, I agree. I must be very careful.  The only other thing is that I constantly mis-type because the keys seem to need a firmer touch that I'm used to. All-in-all though, I totally love my new SAMMY!::Kathryn L. Olson::5.0::May 18, 2012

R16T35IDBESIJF::Perfect for the price::Exactly what I was looking for, and it was very affordable. HDMI and VGA output, 3 USB ports, easily adjustable screen brightness and volume. The full keypad is nice, but I don't use it very much. I mostly stream and watch saved movies, and the hardware and software setup is perfect for that. 4+ hours battery life during casual use, but battery life is variable based on screen brightness. I don't have any complaints about buying the i3 setup instead of the i5 or i7, it's worked flawlessly so far.::Matthew D. Crawley::5.0::December 3, 2011
R3N7LMOL0FHH5W::slight design flaw!!!::the notebook was purchased for my girl friend and she like the notebook.  however, i hate it!!!  the placement of the built in mic is located on the keyboard.  because the mic is located on the keyboard, the internal fan and other internal noise can be heard when you are using skype (or other voip app).  i also have a hard time understanding her because she is usually typing or doing something while chatting.  because her hands are on the keyboard it covers the mic which make her voice sound droned out and when she is typing it creates additional noise.  so if you are planning to use skype or some other equivalent software even a few times, i suggest you avoid this notebook.  you might not notice anything but the person on the other end will hate it!::mandoo4u::3.0::June 8, 2012

R3L0Z61M74SGNL::Very Decent Laptop::This is the first laptop I've owned and I love it. Not to say that there aren't some things I don't like but overall I enjoy using this notebook. So first off...THE GOOD:Quick, not too much bloatware, and beautiful vivid picture quality. I mainly use my laptop for going online, checking emails, going on social medias, watching movies, TV shows and clips online, occasional typing and gaming (very casual and very rare gaming), uploading and downloading pictures etc., lots of music downloading and such. I'm able to accomplish these things with satisfaction...which is saying a lot because I have a tendency to be impatient with computers + internet. :)THE NOT SO GOOD:The screen is glossy which can pick up glare, but that's pretty much the same with just about any laptop nowadays. The arrow keys...I uploaded a picture about this. The arrow keys are jammed onto the keyboard instead of separated out. It's very easy to click on these keys accidentally. Sometimes MY laptop runs hot (but I tend to run it long hours too). Mostly the left side heats up because that's where the vent is. Easily fixed by getting a cooling fan/pad. Averages about 3.5 hours on a complete charge. That's not bad...but kind of wish it was longer (not that I travel or anything, I could easily keep it plugged up).SUGGESTION:If you're a technophile, then no I wouldn't suggest this laptop. For those who want a solid option for a decent price and aren't too nit-picky about every little detail, I would suggest getting it. It may not be able to flawlessly run some MMORPG game, but it'll get the work done and it's a great choice. I don't know about the mic and Skype because I don't use those.MORE TIPS/SUGGESTIONS(SERIOUSLY THIS IS IT):Just so you know, Windows Media Player (I think it's version 12 or something) still kind of sucks. You can watch movies on it and do your music thing but sometimes it'll completely mess up the song titles, artist, etc. You may have to manually go in and fix your music. I didn't want anyone blaming the laptop for that.Also, I'd suggest getting an external hard drive to do backups. You can get a blank DVD disc but it takes F.O.R.E.V.E.R....and a day. And for me it still had problems and wouldn't finish backing up (this is literally doing a backup on the laptop right out of the box with no music, pics or ANYTHING on it). I've read elsewhere that others have this problem with WINDOWS 7 (not the laptop). Amazon may hate me for doing this, but I got a Toshiba 500GB hard drive for $80 at Walmart, which is pretty cheap. It had very good reviews as well. It still takes a while to backup files but not nearly as long as with the disc and very easy to do. Okkkayy, I'm done now.::Logical Query "Kris"::4.0::August 7, 2012
R2RARJMSWYROX4::Silent Beast::Just got this from J&R; as it's local.Only had it a few days so this is just a first impression -What a beaut! - This laptop looks and feels like my perfect ideal for a laptop, understated (no crappy chrome-esq plastic, big glowing lights etc)just a very nice matte black soft finish, nice lines, small(ish) logo, everything looks and feels so solid it just comes together and seems right, a good weight, its not trying to be sleek and light, its just doing one job (high performance) and that is how it looks and feels, I will put up with the weight (not that bad in the included rucksack). So my first impression is very favorable.So I'm in the process of getting all the software sorted out, which i guess is fun.Here's my initial pro's/cons:Pro's:1 - This beast barely breaks a sweat - I mean its so quite, the stealth image does do it justice, it's very quite almost silent, when I reran the window index thingy the sound never changed, and doesn't even feel warm.2 - Screen is lovely Matte and very very bright clear and generally amazing, way too intense in a dark room, my old dell xps 1330 which is sitting besides with both at max brightness it looks like a dull yellow compared, it has very good angular visibility too.3 - Keyboard is nice, firm well spaced out, I like the keyboard lights - without it keys actually very hard to see in low light, as the text doesn't contrast at all with the black keys.3 - Touchpad nice size and nice to have multi-touch gestures.4 - Asus software, actually some useful software(and bloatware see Cons) - like fastboot which delays boot items.5 - Backpack (rucksack) good amount of pockets, sturdy and compact, only just fits laptop in fact, but has plenty of space for extra stuff, nice touch Asus.I don't know about performance as not pushed it at all yet, but from the index score its pretty good, I am mainly using it for graphic's work so its more important to be fast processor and memory than graphics, but I am tempted to buy and try some of the latest games cos this beast is designed for them. Btw in case you don't know one downside to this rig is the graphics card has a 128bit memory bus instead of 192, which from what I have read makes a difference, the 17" has the 192 bit bus. It's no big deal for me and having a usable size for a laptop was more important than Memory bus speed, still would have preferred to have the option for this, recon most gamers will pay the extra and Asus should have made some models with the bigger bus, and given us the choice.Cons:1 - Bloatware - crappy crappy annoying bloatware, such a shame cos in my mind Asus has really got there stuff together, making some seriously decent equipment and marketing and doing everything right, except bowing to the pressure to include crap on their rigs (for a small dime no doubt) - I decided to create a backup disc set and reformat which took hours only to find that the backup disc puts all the crap on again except the drivers which you need, so either way you have to uninstall it all. I ended up taking almost everything off then using the asus utility to load the drivers and useful stuff back on. thing is there are tons of processes running and I hate not knowing whats happening behind the scenes on my rig, I wish I could completely disable/delete most of these processes and services running but I don't know what they all do.2 - included gaming mouse is nice, uninstalled software for it, limited control and adds to the startup.Will update after a while when I learn more.Update 1:Had a problem with the Realtek Lan network drivers, they kept failing to install fully and could not get windows to get the drivers to work or install, spent many hours trying to find the solution online and in their help guides, was thinking either the lan hardware was dead or in some kind of zombie like deep sleep. Eventually got it to work, uninstalled everything Realtek driver and windows device hardware, rebooted then manually installed by handpicking the type of device and the driver -thankfully everything started to work! - I now have lan working and don't have to do a emergency disk reinstall from scratch or send it back.Power4Gear Hybrid seems really buggy, doesn't connect quickly enough with the hardware button, also when I save it to screen timeout it doesn't work and the screen just stayed on, all night! - not a major bug but hope they fix with a update.Also with all the software installed or most of it, my processes list is way too big for me! I like to know what's running and keep my system simple and bare, but this is more about the extra software included, and being unsure what I can uninstall.::Mr Orpheus::5.0::December 12, 2011
R3UK04DCDWES2L::Built like a stealth fighter jet, and runs like one too!::Im gonna cut straight to what you gamers want to hear.This laptop can run skyrim at MAX settings, and ittl get a TEEENY bit choppy in towns.It can run WoW at max settings, without skipping a beat. (poor internet connections may still slow the loading of orgrimmar though)It can run SWTOR at max settings, and same as wow, my slow interet speeds slow the loading of the Republic fleet on a busy day.It can run Tf2 at max settings, even when i use console commands to DOUBLE the gamespeed on offline practice mode.It runs minecraft at full settings without flaw.Im currently installing Just Cause 2 and Portal 2 and Garys mod to test those games, but based on how it handled the first 5, im sure they'll do just fineThe gaming mouse mine came with was a nice freebie, but as a long time user of the Razer Naga, i feel that the button placement for hte included mouse is horrible for gaming.  Two on either side of the primary mouse buttons. and 2 below the scroll wheel.It also comes with a backpack. Ive only used the backpack for 1 day so far, but it seems like a decent backpack.The backpack is dark grey with mild green. (at least the one *I* received is that color, peraps the colors vary)at first i ordered this laptop by mistake  ( i was reviewing the G73sx )  but after researching more,  and seeing in person  how big a 17'3 laptop is, im glad i got this version.The trackpad is OKAY i guess, but when im playing anything but SWTOR or WOW, i use an external mouse.also its easy to disable the trackpad so you dont hit it by accident, you just press Fn+F9the lighted keyboard is very nice, there are also arrows on the WASD keys, and a little jumping dude on the spacebar.The battery life depends what setting u have it on, theres a button on the top left that switches the laptop between 4 modes:1. High Performance2. Quiet office3. Entertainment (Theater)4. Battery saverat first i thought my laptop couldnt game with lots of other stuff open in the background, then i realized i just had it on battery saving mode. So dont get worried when that happens, just make sure u set it to high performance.and as the default background suggests, this laptop has the look and feel of a stealth fighter jet.This is a fantastic laptop. DEFINITELY worth the money.::Vard::5.0::January 9, 2012
R2BM6BA55RJJ7E::ASUS PC is great purchase!::I purchased the Asus laptop based on a recommendation from my son, who has had an Asus for the last 2 years. The G53SX is a great PC! It was delivered early and was exactly what I had ordered, all parts in place and ready to rock and roll! I wanted a good gaming machine for Lord of the Rings Online, and it is just perfect for it! The HD screen is wonderful. It's a somewhat heavier laptop, but I chalk that up to the fact that it is made out of sturdy, quality, materials. Oh, one thing that I should mention is how quiet this laptop is. Compared to my older HP laptop, I barely know I am running anything, even my hi-def game! And it is super-cool, temperature-wise, too! I've had it for about a month or so and am very happy with it!::Jeff Drake::5.0::November 27, 2011
R1120NJ2SMYH0V::Exactly what I was looking for!::I've been using the computer for just over two weeks now and love it!  When I first purchased a laptop in 2007, my main objective was to get something powerful for online gaming.  At that time I was playing World of Warcraft, and the rig I had purchased harnessed more than enough power to handle it smoothly.  Most people into PC gaming though, are well aware that WoW is not a very graphically intensive game.  So what I ended up with was a laptop that was great for playing games at my desk at home, but not practical at all for any other purpose.  It was too cumbersome, weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 pounds, had a 17 inch screen and a 10"x3x"4" "Brick" that was part of the power cord.  So I essentially had a "mobile computer", that wasn't really mobile at all which I spent far too much money on and turned out being a lemon after 6 months with horrible customer support.  But I'm not writing this review on that laptop, I'm just trying to give you a little history on what motivated me to buy this particular laptop.  So, back to the original topic at hand...the product review.This time around when I decided to purchase another laptop I decided to go with something smaller, lighter weight and powerful enough to handle today's games without going too far over the top on the hardware.  One of the main problems I've noticed with buying what is regarded as "today's most powerful computer" is that the more powerful the rig, the bigger it gets.  This laptop seems to be a perfect balance between the two for me.  The size is right, so the computer is mobile and it has pretty decent graphics power.  The first thing I installed was "Rift", which is an MMO similar in gameplay to World of Warcraft but far more graphically demanding.  I'm currently running this game on the highest factory setting without going into custom settings and the game is running beautifully!  The computer design is also quite unique and very appealing.  It also comes with a backpack/carrying case which makes the computer mobile in less than a minute.I would recommend this laptop to anyone who wants a decent machine without spending a fortune on any of the top end models.  My intentions are to try a few different MMOs, trade stocks and take online classes and I'm sure this computer has the power to handle any of those tasks.  This makes my 5th computer/laptop and I'm extremely pleased with it so far!::J. Bumphrey::5.0::December 25, 2011
R1O4F13R9IWDKV::Failed After Only One Week::The Asus G53SX is a powerful machine -- when it is working. Plays all games at "ultra" settings without breathing hard and at an attractive price point.However, the video card failed after only one week. Suddenly, the lcd screen remains dark during boot. It is either the screen or video card that is faulty since (fortunately) the video out port works when I plug in an external monitor. This enabled me to recover my files. This problem is apparently a known issue and more common than should be acceptable to any manufacturer. Searching the Web you'll find numerous incidents of this problem with other owners of Asus' Republic of Gaming machines (both G73 and G53 models). In fact there is a You Tube video showing another frustrated owner with this issue.As powerful this machine is and as sweet as it is to use -- when in working condition.  My advice is to avoid this machine until this issue is fixed.  Or take your chances and get frustrated with a machine that costs $1400+/- with a known history of failure. Apparently Asus has an issue with quality control of their notebooks or are ignoring the issue as a cost of doing business.Update:After getting little satisfaction from Asus Support, Amazon stepped in and reaffirmed their commitment to excellent customer service. I am a long time / avid buyer and constantly "spoiled" by their adherence to customer satisfaction. The growth and profitability of their business reflects the priority they put on going the extra mile to meeting the customer needs. More companies should learn from their example. It is not surprise that Amazon has such a loyal customer base.Oh - Amazon is sending a replacement. Hopefully, I will have more luck with the reliability of the machine.Update:It has been several months since I received the replacement unit and it has operated flawlessly. Continues to be a great machine with all the power you need to play any game without exhibiting any effort. I have updated the rating to 3 stars, it would have been 5 stars except for the fact that the first unit did was flawed.::PeteL "avid buyer"::3.0::January 27, 2012
R1CKX4O6DSY9UT::Awesome computer for the money::This computer is amazing. Below are the positive and negativesThe positives:1. Fast - This computer is really fast2. Quiet - Even running the computer on the highest performance you cant hear the fans.3. Amazing video card - Running SWTOR on max settings and it doesnt slow down or anything. it is amazing to play the game how it was intended4. Fair price - Although a little on the high side, for what you are getting on this computer you cant complain. you are getting a top notch computerThe Negatives:1. Its big and heavy. It is about the size of a 17" computer with a 15 inch screen and it feels like a brick2. The keyboard has a little flex3. Bloatware - The computer comes with bloatware, i wish it didntMy computer came with a wired gaming mouse and laptop backpack included in the asus box. The bag is nice, i didnt try the mouse though.::Michael::5.0::February 6, 2012
R2F6KXGXG2WD7Y::Solid Performing Tank.::Have to be forward with this, I was nervous forking over money for this Brick. I scoured many reviews and found complaints and issues yet kept an eye out for ASUS laptops due to their lower cost compared to its competition being Alienware, and Sager. I really wanted to get this models bigger 17" brother but was turned off by the size and weight. I'm not saying that this laptop is much lighter. Its a beast.Complaints so far:Webcam and Mic are not the greatest, but adequate. I have had a few complaints using Teamspeak that I'm muffled. I plan on overlooking this by using my phones Bluetooth headset.The power port is annoying! I wish they would have wired it through the back or at least further back on the side.The Speakers as well can't compare to the competition such as MSI yet I will sometimes switch off with some headphones if I really do need to hear something.Praises:This tank is fast. Though I could upgrade it to the full 16GB ram, I probably wont because its smooth enough for me.Gaming. I am an old school gamer so graphics have never been my top priority, just mandatory. I've play Starcraft 2, Diablo 3 (beta), Terraria, Minecraft, Battlefield 3, Dead Island and Team Fortress 2. And I'm pretty embarrassed to admit. The graphics on this laptop blow my personal computer away (Need to upgrade badly now).The wireless card was a concern by reading some other reviews so I had to test it everywhere to see if I had to upgrade to an Intel card. Working at multiple sights and at home the card performed wonderfully.Two Kensington locks on the back allow for some broad security which is needed where I work.Bonus:The ROG Mouse the laptop came with is great. Though I love my Logitech G500 which stays home. This ROG Mouse will stay will my laptop.The Backpack is pretty decent. The only gripe is on occasion its difficult to close around the beefy laptop, but still possible. It holds all my gear I need and looks pretty guide and disguises the laptop well from curious minds.In all I'm glad I purchased this portable tank and for one whole week of loading stuff on it, its a winner in my book.::Chris C. King::5.0::January 14, 2012
R2NW4OE0NH1DC5::Bad Power Connection::Like another reviewer, I've also had started having problems the AC adaptor and the battery.  It will cycle between AC and DC power at random.  I don't know if this is because of the placement of the adaptor and me consistently bumping up against it because of this bad placement, or some other reason.  The metal end of the power adaptor will get extremely hot to the touch as well.  I honestly don't know how long this laptop will last and it really bugs me that I'm expecting this unit to fail after only having it a few months.  It's still under warranty and I will get this fixed, but it is a huge inconvenience to lose my laptop for a couple of weeks (again) for a second repair in the time that I've owned it.  I do regret my purchase decision and will waste no additional money on ASUS products in the future.::Amazon Customer::1.0::June 7, 2012
R2LH2XHBP74UBV::Flawed and Asus knows it::Recieved this laptop and the packaging was perfect, no signs of damage. Turned it on and downloaded Skype, closed the screen and switched rooms. When i opened the screen back up it was pure white! Nothing i could do to fix it. Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement which took about a week. When i received the new one, its screen showed nothing but black. I could hear windows load up through the speakers but couldnt see anything.Apparently on this model they made the cable that attaches the screen to the board about 1mm to short. This comes from a local repair tech who has dealt with this before. Being to short they are subject to extra stress on the pivot point and the connectors. Some even break during shipping straight from the factory, others never break. He said that Asus knows about it but refuses to acknowledge it as a manufacturing defect. He said he has repaired at least 20 of these and they all have come back with the same problem again. Apparently there is a 1.5mm longer cable you can get if you can find it on ebay or something. But i just sent it back and am now buying an Alienware. Its a little bit more money but a better screen and something i can trust.::AKDowling::1.0::April 24, 2012

R2XDBPIUB4M93P::Good but fragile::This computer looks great: fast albeit heavy.The problem is that the notebook has an extremely fragile power jack. It breaks often. This obviously cripples the whole system and there is no way of fixing it except sending it back to California.You can tell how big the problem is when the official forum has a 17 pages thread about the problem:[...]The repair people were courteous enough but it still takes 2 weeks to send the computer in, get it repaired and sent back. And then a month later you'll have to send it back again because the new power jack is broken.Right now it's just inconvenient. And what will happen when my 2 year warranty expires? This was such a huge expenditure, and soon they'll make me pay dear to mantain it.This is such a shame. I have been a loyal Asus costumer for so long. I used to own an Asus m50v , I own an Asus transformer. And the reason I chose Asus was because their manufacturing standards were extremely high (the m50 is truly indestructible). But that period is gone. Clearly Asus quality control can't be trusted anymore. I won't be cheated again.::Ernesto::2.0::August 2, 2012
R2E2MU8YMEQRA6::not entirely perfect, but not at all bad::After kicking around a few options for a gaming / heavy work desktop-replacement laptop, I decided to roll with an open-box G53SX - hard to resist nearly 40% off a beast like this.Here are some things worth noticing: - it's really pretty heavy. - it's super quiet - it's super cool (as in great ventilation, doesn't singe your lap) - touch pad responsiveness is kind of... mushy, I guess? - keyboard lighting is cool, unless you're looking at the keys from an angle - then a lot of light bleeds out from under the seams, and that's brighter than the glyphs printed on the keys themselves, sort of ruining the benefit of illuminating them in the first place. - battery lasts for a couple hours under constant use - gaming and internet surfing and video watching, on wireless. - keyboard layout isn't my favorite - on the right-hand side, Ctrl / Shift / Enter are staggered weirdly, and the PgUp / PgDn buttons (as Fn+9 and Fn+3) are really poorly placed. - I know all the space is taken up by cooling vents, but I wish a few things (like the power cord) were moved to the back, rather than stuffed into the sides. - onboard speakers aren't worth listening to anything on, though that's kind of a non-issue I guesshopefully that helps you get a better perspective on this monster - it's big and beefy, not perfect, but extremely capable.EDIT: unfortunately, I wound up with a case of bad vram on the dedicated video card, and had to return mine. Hopefully an isolated incident.::Matt Lohkamp::4.0::July 29, 2012
R1B9MVR4141U5J::Great Gaming Laptop::Awesome machine.  Graphics are amazing, speed is great.  Playing SWTOR at top speed.  I love the selection of hi performance, battery saver, etc.  Vents tons of heat, is very heavy and hard to fit in a regular bag. Turbo boost rocks, sleek design, and loads of space for games/programs/software.  touchpad is nice, the light up keyboard is great to play with at night.::GregoryFam5::5.0::May 14, 2012
R3FN4A56EZ98M0::Bad power cord connection placement::This is an awesome laptop and works great! I am a senior American in my 60s and just wanted a trouble-free system to play games like Skyrim, Diablo III, and WoW. This machine ticks alll the boxes.But why oh why did they put the power connection on the right side in the way of using the mouse for right-handed players? Yes, you can buy the right-angle connector, and I did, but eventually, I started having problems with the power changing over from the power cord to the batteries and back again. This is a major annoyance for me. I am going to buy another power cord with a right-angle plug already on it and see if that helps. To me this should be a no-brainer for the people who design these computers. Please, Asus, don't put the power connection there on your ROG models! Gamers don't use the touch-pad at all. Very bad planning.::AndreaS::4.0::May 2, 2012

RHHSHIPK53XZ3::Getting frustrated.::After having the computer for a year I decided to write an updated review. This is my second Asus gaming laptop. I bought my first one in 2010. The one I bought in 2010 had several problems. During a 2-year period, the video card fan went bad, a USB port collapsed and shorted out the motherboard, and the display eventually stopped turning on. Fortunately I bought a 2 year extended warranty, so all of those issues were covered. But literally a few weeks after the warranty expired, the video card fan went bad again, and now the fan sounds like a lawn mower and the laptop overheats. 2 years later I bought a second Asus hoping the first one was just a lemon.During the first year of owning my GS53X it has been in for repairs 3 times. The first problem was the display not turning on. The computer would power up, but the display remains black. The second problem, the pin inside the power input port fell out, making it impossible to plug in the power cord. Now just today, the display stopped turning on yet again. I've always had problems with both my Asus laptops with the display not turning on after the computer goes into sleep mode, but after a restart it always starts working again. Now after multiple restarts the display will not turn on.The laptop is a great product...when it works. I have friends with Asus laptops and they have never had these problems, so maybe I have bad luck. It runs great, and has little problems running high-end games. I just wish I didn't have so many problems, because I don't know if I'll buy another Asus after this.::Blake Thorne::2.0::April 4, 2012

R1MP5DSJIVCTQK::I worked for about 6 days...::So I had purchased this laptop a while back, and got it around feb 23rd. It was all very neatly boxed up, and the laptop bag and mouse that came with it were pretty nice.The laptop itself was very nice, and most of the pro's that people mentioned were true, (powerful gaming experience, being practically silent, effectivly cooling itself down, etc.) but that didn't last long. Initially when I started it up for the first time I had a odd red pixelated shading effect on my screen for about 10 seconds, but the computer fixed itself and I thought little of it.I ran Skyrim at high settings with a little more than 30 FPS and was stable. So when it came down to gaming it was pretty dang powerful for more recent games.The problem I had was that on the 6th day of owning it, I started it up and let it load up normally, and I noticed that some of the pixels on the Microsoft loading screen were really weird. Then I noticed I had yellow pixel shadings everywhere, and I had no idea what to do. I reset it, and it did nothing, if anything more yellow shading popped up.I called Asus support, and was able to talk to a human. Unfortunately I was not able to fix the problem with me, and one of the first things he recommended was to send it to Asus to be repaired, and that would take roughly 12 business days he said. Why send it there if I had the option to also send it back to amazon in 2 days and get my money back ASAP?Regardless, the conclusion is that it WAS a good computer. Having read the reviews, it seemed like a hit or miss item to get, but we gambled it. It did prove itself to be a powerful computer and was quick to use and had a number of performance options available. It just stinks that it died so quickly, and not being able to fix a screen problem. All I can say is that it was good while it lasted, but just avoid it because of what other people have experienced with it.::David Naugler::2.0::March 2, 2012

Asus replaced the hard drive this time and did something to fix the touchpad!! but the story does not end there! Its past the 30 day return time now and to some reason i decieded to campare what i bought to another Asus, Well the hard drives that where replace only add up to 671 and it had a 750, also came with 12gb installed memory and now it only has 8gb installed memory so now i have to find out what Asus will do about it (IF ANYTHING)ASUS G53SX-DH71 Full HD 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop - Republic of Gamers (Black)::tallicdrg::1.0::March 13, 2012
RZFHGEPCO9L6B::It is a beast and handles as expected!::I just received the Asus G53SX-DH71 and have been using it for less than 48 hours.  I was so excited and wanted to try out some games and install some professional development tools on it to push its limit but unfortunately I have not been able to do so because the system is unstable.  What I mean by unstable is the laptop's video goes blank/black and there is no way to get the screen to turn on without having to do a hard reset or power off.  Even doing so will not guarantee it will work when turned on.  I'm not sure maybe I received a bad unit but we'll see if technical support can help me or I'm probably just going to send this in for repairs or exchange.So here are the following hardware failures I have experienced frequently thus far:- Cannot return from Hibernation mode.  Once the system is in Hibernation mode, pressing the power button turns the system on the but screen is completely black and does not turn on.  Pressing buttons, moving the mouse or touch pad doesn't do anything.- While the system is on, connecting or disconnecting the power cord causes the screen to go black.  Reversing what I just did does nothing so I have to do a hard shutdown.  Turning the system back on again doesn't guarantee the screen will turn on.- Experienced 1 of 2 things when turning the system on or restarting via Windows:1) The system powers on and just sits there with the screen completely black2) The system powers on and the screen is black but goes all the way thru the Windows login process just fine but the screen is still offWhat I have done to get around it and get the screen to turn on and see the Asus logo show up is open the screen at about 30 degrees, or opening the lid as little as possible so I can still press the Power button.  Once the system powers up and I can see the Asus logo pop up then I know the screen is on and all is well.  Otherwise, at times with the screen/lid opened all the way and turning on the system the screen stays black and I just have to do a hard shutdown and retry again.Until, I can get the system operating normally or possibly replaced with a working unit without these shortcomings I'll have to give this product only 1 star for the potential that it has...I'll update the review if I get a chance at new unit or repaired one.ASUS Republic of Gamers G53SX-DH71 Full HD 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (Black)====================UPDATE 2012-02-16: I am VERY impressed with the level of service from Amazon and its distributor.  Within 24 hours of reporting the original unit being defective I received confirmation of a new unit is being sent and I received it the very next business day! So back to the unit, the performance is superb with the out-of-box configurations and default 12 GB RAM, 750 GB HD, and GeForce GTX 560M 2GB.I was able to play most games (e.g. Starcraft II, WOW, Modern Warfare II, Unreal Tournament, Crysis) without issues at high resolution. On top of that the system is hefty enough to handle running database and web servers while playing the games.  On top of that, I am also have MS Visual Studio open and developing on the side.The built-in webcam and microphone works just fine.  Video playback of 1080i movies were great as well.  Too bad the unit didn't have a blu-ray player.Improvements I would say can be with the audio which is not as loud and the layout of the power plug input.  It tends to get in the way of my mouse movements being on the right side of the unit instead of the left or back of the laptop. I also wonder why they did not opt to go with a magnetic connector similar to the kind found on the MacBooks.  The power cord when plugged into the laptop is also not flush, giving it an illusion that it is not all the way in for a good connection.Overall I am satisfied!  Oh do expect the thing to be quite big if you haven't owned a  laptop that is classified as desktop replacement although it hasn't prevented me from bringing it around to the coffee shops or around the home office.::T.

R32A0DYG3G170Z::First one was a dud, second one is great so far::We bought this computer as a Christmas gift for our 13 year old son.  We conducted a lot of research on gaming laptops and decided on this one instead of the Alienware one he asked for, because of all the complaints and problems people had with Alienware computers (we laugh about this now).  We received it about 2 weeks before Christmas and turned it on once to install the updates - everything worked great.  The second time we turned it on was Christmas Eve (when we were setting it up for him to find Christmas morning), and the screen was completely black, although the lights on the keyboard worked and we could hear it starting up.  We tried everything over the next few hours, called Asus tech support at 1:00 a.m. and tried everything they suggested, and they finally said send it back.  Needless to say, our son was devastated on Christmas morning.  Amazon was great and shipped a new one right away, which our son received on Dec. 28.  The new one has worked great (so far) and our son loves it.  The backpack case is nice.  The mouse that was included is a gaming mouse, but oddly a different mouse came with the first one than the second one (the first one was better).  This would have been a 5 star review had the first computer worked.  Now I'm worried that it's a matter of time before the second one conks out.::L. Clark::3.0::January 7, 2012
R2ZBR3YA3RWK6J::I've Had a Great Experience So Far!::I'm somewhat surprised by the other reviewers having problems as they have. I have had mine for almost 3 months and I have no big issues. The touch pad does take some getting used to but mine doesn't need excessive pressure. The one thing it does occasionally is go into zoom mode accidentally, but I think it's caused by touching it at more than one place while typing. I went in to the options and set it up like I like it when it was days old. The keyboard is reasonably good for me. It's not the best I've ever tried, but it is far from the worst and I prefer it to the HP and the Acer that are also in my household. I like the Mac keyboard my daughter has a little better.I don't have any other issues. I bought mine from one of the large vendors that allow you to customize the laptop when you buy it. I put a 120GB SSD in lieu of the standard primary drive and  a 750GB 7200 RPM unit as the secondary drive. I deleted the Blu-Ray burner and replaced it with a cheaper Blu-Ray player to cut the cost a little bit and because I don't anticipate burning Blu-Ray discs. I don't remember the other changes, but there were a few. I have 8GB of RAM, but slightly better than the original. I had the software installed by the vendor after the changes were made, without putting all the ASUS bloatware back in.The monitor is very, very good. I had a previous ASUS (M70) with the same resolution but the colors were washed out on that one when watching movies or playing games. This one is fabulous. Everyone who tries it is very impressed. I like the way it gets rid of heat. I would prefer a different 12V connection because I like to hold it between my legs in a recliner occasionally and it sticks out in the way. The Mac solution is the best and I don't know why all vendors don't do something similar. Oh, yeah, the touch pad is getting shiny where I use it all the time. I've only played one game on it: Sniper- Ghost Warrior. It runs it at max settings without problems and it is beautiful. It is awkward to use this touch pad for gaming and I would prefer a mouse if I wasn't sitting in my recliner. Because of back problems, I can't sit upright in a different chair for long periods playing games, so for me I just make do. I might try some kind of a game controller.I hope that this helps some of you to see that not all are dissatisfied.::Watching::5.0::February 24, 2012
R1W5VFQWW28GQR::I love it::Unfortunate that other folks have had negative experiences. I have not.I've had mine for about 9 months now, I use it as a professional 'moving-workstation', doing a lot of heavy creative development work, (Adobe Suite, 3D graphics, Motion Tracking etc.)Hardware: A+. The GFX card combined with the generous default RAM and Processor set up have enabled me to do everything I need to, and I do some fairly heavy duty graphics work. The monitor is bright and crisp. I recently upgraded the machine to 16GB ram and it is now performing even better. I have done some 3D gaming on the machine and it holds up comparably to its specs. The 1TB harddrive has been more than enough for my needs. I considered swapping it out for an SSD, but at this point the extra space is more valuable than the speed.Sound: Good enough. I don't watch movies that much on it, but when I do, the sound is good. I have only used the subwoofer attachment once, because I don't think it added enough value to merit carrying it around.Nits: The keyboard could be better. I love having a full keyboard with num-pad, because I can do a lot of shortcut key work using the num pad, but I do wish it could have had chicklet style keys (not possible with this screen size and also including a numpad, they did the best they could given the form factor).The trackpad multi touch is good but not Apple good. I hate Apple stuff for a lot of reasons, but they are simply the leaders in multi-touch responsiveness and reliability. Asus gets close with this, and the multitouch is functional and adds a lot of efficiency. It's reliable, but it's not delightful.The DVD eject button is very difficult to press, I usually have to lift the machine up and look at the button to find it before I can press it. However, I honestly have only needed optical media a handful of times since I got the machine.There is a fair amount of bloatware, but I have not uninstalled it as they all seem to be serving a valuable purpose (eg. USB charging when the machine is off, Instant On and battery management).The glossy lid material sucks. It's a fingerprint magnet. I do wish it was matte.It is not a very solid feeling machine (eg. an aluminium MBP), it feels plastic in the lid area, but it is actually quite solid. It has held up fine (no drops or abuse at my end, but I do travel a lot by plane (including international travel), and it has taken all that moving around without so much as a ding or scratch)./NitsThe keys on the left hand side that shortcut to various items do not bother me. I rarely press them accidentally (as they are too stiff to do so), but I also only use the volume control keys and the rest just take up space.Instant On is very reliable and works excellently. I love it.HDMI out is a great +, and have used it often. USB 3 and the USB always-on charger port have also been great things to have. My phone died while I was out on a job in the middle of a chaotic environment, ran a cable from my backpack into my pocket, and made it through the rest of the day. Got on a plane and my phone was near dead, plugged it in and napped through the flight, disembarked with a fully charged phone and barely a dent in my battery life on the laptop.Heat management is quite good. It runs hot when the GPU really goes to work, as you would expect, but even then it is not so hot as to be uncomfortable to hold on your lap while working. During normal use the temperature is nominal.The power management is fairly good, I get 5-6 hrs of regular use, 2-3 hours of heavy use (Video editing etc.) Standby seems to last forever... Long enough for a regular use machine If you are looking for a machine with a longer battery life, you would need to compromise on power and weight. This is a good balance of power, weight and battery life. I love the fact that the battery does not charge if it is plugged in and the level is >97%. Thank you ASUS for protecting me from unnecessary battery decay.It's not light, it's not unbearably heavy. It is not a light machine, but again, this is a powerful workstation, and so portability is sacrificed slightly.Overall, and for the cost, if you need a gaming rig or a 3d/2d graphics workstation on a budget, and are willing to making some partial sacrifices in the battery life and scale departments, this machine simply cannot be beat. I have a MacBook Pro from my office and I absolutely loath using it for graphics work as opposed to this bad boy, it is SO much snappier and more stable.Why then, a 4 star review and not 5 stars?1) Glossy lid, matte would have made my machine look cleaner and feel cleaner.2) Not chicklet style keyboard (I know it would not have been possible, but I still wish for it).3) More more more more/Less less less less. More battery life. Less weight. Possible? Probably not, but again, I wish for it.4) I wish the multitouch was more 'delightful' to use (but it is fully usable in its current state).::antiraza::4.0::August 15, 2012
ROOP3AS8OVHKK::ASUS N75SF:  A Disappointment::I was so looking forward to this laptop computer after researching it.  It seemed to excel compared with competitors.  However, it didn't live up to expectations:Pros:Looks stylish, very bright/sharp monitor, huge touchpad that with one slide of the fingertip moves the cursor the whole length/width of the screen, sound is excellent with high volume potential, pretty light for its size, runs cool and speed of operation is fast.Cons:The touchpad can also be a negative because there is no defining border to know when you are going to touch it; being so large on the palm-rest area, my palms brushed it often and it interferred with my typing unless I turned it off.The keys, even though they look nice, are flat with little space between them, which I found messed-up my keystrokes (I would tick a bordering key by mistake).  Additionally, certain keys would not register unless I used excessive pressure; again, messing-up my keystroke rhythm.The Asus software had some moderate compatibility problems working with Windows 7.  I did 3 factory restores and still had OS conflicts.  I ran a test on the OS and found Asus made changes to Windows 7 (to accommodate their programs, I guess) and 3 corrupted Asus files were identified, which cannot be replaced manually and Windows 7 could not fix them (you can read about it on the web if you research this problem with this particular model).  The solution recommended from a forum was to install a clean version of Windows 7 (which can be downloaded from a European website) and use the Windows 7 authorization key on the underside of the laptop to activate it.  I didn't try it so I don't know if it would work or how it would affect the integrated Asus programs.Another suggestion was to phone Asus tech support to ask if they had a patch to correct the problem, which seemed easy enough.  I wanted to also contact them about the keystroke pressure/registering inconsistencies.  However, I could not find a USA support number on their website.  As an alternative, I used their website to send a detailed message requesting support (twice, actually).  I never did get a reply.  Therefore, even though the warranty sounds great, if there is no tech support follow-up/follow-though, it is worthless.I concluded there were irresolvable defects, so I returned the laptop to Amazon for a refund.By the way, I ordered through Amazon on a Saturday morning and my computer was delivered on Monday morning....Wow, the free shipping for this product from Arizona to SF Bay Area was fast!::R. Poole::2.0::December 14, 2011
RR14LXXMHIBP7::Almost perfect, were it not for nVidia Optimus::I was shopping for a new laptop a while ago, and happened to find this one.  It had everything I was looking for:1.  Recent Intel Chipset2.  nVidia Graphics3.  1920x1080 display4.  Full 10-Key number pad5.  Good speakers6.  8 gigabytes of RAM7.  4 USB Ports8.  802.11N WiFi standardThis laptop has been doing most of what I wanted it to, which includes video viewing, web-surfing, network management, and some gaming (still meaning to try virtual machines).  However, the place where this laptop falls short is the fact that it has nVidia Optimus Technology, which means that nVidia is providing no Linux support for this laptop.  Had I know about the Optimus issue, and that the Optimus technology was in this laptop, I would have went with a different one.  I have got proper 3D Acceleration with IronHide (and previously BumbleBee), but actual nVidia support would be twice as fast, if not more.  It is better than my old laptop (nVidia GeForce 9800M), but only by a hair.  Games I've run (which all run at least decent) include Doom3, Quake 3, Wolfenstein:  Enemy Territory, MineCraft, Nexuiz, Smokin' Guns, and Tile Racer.The battery life, while not terrible, isn't as good as other laptops I've used.  I didn't run the battery down, but the report from Ubuntu 12.04 was that I had roughly an hour and fourty-nine minutes.  If I had turned the brightness down, and turned off the WiFi, I probably could have got 4 hours though.The speakers on this thing are awesome; they are much louder than my old Asus G50V.  The laptop also came with its own portable sub-woofer, which I still need to try.  Another improvement over the G50V is that the headphone port isn't finicky; you don't have to find the right spot for sound to go to headphones.The display is really good too, nice and bright, 1920x1080.  Not much else to say there.The Intel Core i7 processor is an eight core CPU, which I have yet to tax.  I can't wait to see how well it handles virtual machines.Touch pad works, but because it isn't exactly "defined."  There are just two slits on the side, nothing at the top to determine when it ends/begins.  It is difficult to determine when I'm using the vertical scroll on the bar, or just fumbling on surface.Also, two of the USB ports are 3.0 standard, but I don't have any USB 3.0 devices to test them with.  However, I've noticed that those two ports don't always work, and it is random.  Sometimes it will work on (re)boot, or quit on wake.  The USB 2.0 ports seem to always work.Other features:Blu-Ray Drive1280x720 WebCamSummaryGood:  Intel Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, Speakers, Display, Two 500GB hard drivesBad:  No proper nVidia support (not an issue if you use Windows, but a major problem for Linux Gamers), short battery life, finicky USB 3.0 portIndifferent:  Blu-Ray Drive::B.

R53VYD15OZ872::Buyer Beware::I have edited this review multiple times out of a sense of fairness. After all, things go wrong sometimes. A single piece of faulty hardware does not implicate an entire line. But terrible warranty repair? Multiple times? A driver issue that many customers have and Asus cannot or will not fix? I am so angry at this point that I am opening a case with the BBB. Asus has gone beyond bad service into actually damaging whatever value is left in my laptop. I shall spend the semester saving money to buy a brand new $1000+ laptop I can ill-afford just to replace this utter piece of crap.Straight of the box, the NS7SF is pretty awesome. The only complaint I had was the touchpad, which had buttons chosen for aesthetics without regard for how much pressure is required to use them. But the screen was brilliantly vivid; whites were bright enough to require a lowering of the brightness and blacks were pitch-black even at the highest brightness settings. The videocard ran modern games like Left 4 Dead 2 on high settings without overheating. And the sound was fantastic, even without the sub-woofer. A friend of mine walked into my living room and thought I was playing music from my tv instead of the N75SF. There really wasn't anything I wasn't satisfied with aside from the touchpad. Even the case seemed sturdy; unlike my previous laptop, the back of the LCD panel didn't bend inward if I happened to place something on top of it.This lasted until the USB ports started having issues with a half-dozen different devices. Code 10 error after using them once and then plugging them back in later. The only way to fix it was to restart the entire system. Kind of a pain if you are multi-tasking and just need to do one small thing on a USB device. I tried multiple factory resets without any change. Eventually, I RMA'ed it. But this was only after the power-harness became so loose I had to fight with the jack to get it to charge. This all by April, and I bought the laptop in October.So, Asus pays for the shipping to/from the RMA center and are pretty quick about it, too. Maybe two weeks, including shipping time. But when I get it, I find out that the harness is still slightly loose, though not nearly as bad; I suspect I will run into the exact same power issue within six months, however. The motherboard was replaced, but didn't fix the USB issues (meaning it was a driver issue that Asus *somehow* was unaware of up until then). They also replaced a speaker somewhere because I was having issues with the sound disappearing, but there's no telling if it was hardware or driver.Finally, they replaced the LCD screen. This was neither desired nor requested by me. They saw some problems with the screen (a few small bright spots that had never bothered me because they were only visible against extremely light backgrounds). That, initially, seemed quite lovely. They saw a problem and took proactive action, right? Wrong. They replaced the screen with a substandard, non-stock model. This screen was duller than the $300 Compaq screen in my old laptop. It lacked any vividness and whites were not white, but grey. I was furious, but I was busy with moving.Fast forward less than a month, the day before a trip to the city I was moving to, and the LCD screen fails entirely. Would not come on at all. Obviously, Asus is using refurbished parts, regardless of their condition, to satisfy their warranties. So it gets sent in again. I get it back fairly quickly and they've replaced it with a slightly different LCD model, but at least it's somewhat comparable. It's not as bright and reflects like a mirror (unlike the original), but at least it's brighter than the Compaq laptop (unlike the first replacement). But it's also refurbished since it came stock with dead pixels. I also just absolutely love that they managed to break the speaker plate above the keyboard; neither end will stay down now.So, to reiterate, Asus first tried using a sub-standard, non-stock replacement part for an undesired and unrequested repair. When that part failed, they went with a better model (but still refurbished) replacement part, but broke a part of the laptop before sending it back to me. My $1300 was certainly money well spent; multiple reinstallations, multiple RMA's, and at the end of the day, I still have a slightly broken laptop.That said, if the only thing you care about is a very quick warranty service that will get your laptop functioning enough to use (even if only for a little while), Asus is perfect.I give props to their (I suspect foreign) customer service representatives (I contacted them through e-mail). They were always very polite, even when my temper was frayed. But that is absolutely the only positive thing I can say about my experience with Asus.::Overquoted::1.0::February 1, 2012
R3QDQ1JTDS81X3::Wow... Great PC!::First off, I'd like to say that this is my fist Asus product. Before, all my computers had been HP's. While researching, I was looking for a couple main things: primarily a powerful GPU, ample storage space, a fast HD, plenty of RAM, and a Core i7 CPU. Now I'll break it down into categories.Aesthetics:The screen is HUGE. 17.3 inches is amazing, and it is incredibly vibrant. The native 1920 x 1080 resolution is amazing - it really is "True HD". So far, I've tried Netflix, YouTube and Vimeo, all at HD, and they look beautiful. The laptop itself is quite big and heavy, but that's what you would expect since it is 17.3". The lid closes nicely, too. I love where the ventilation is placed, since my last computer had the vent on the bottom, and it would burn my lap. The vent on the side is very convenient, and is great.Ports: This computer has 2x USB 2.0 ports, 2x USB 3.0 ports which are 10x faster. There are two on each side, which is nice if you like a mouse. There is also an HDMI output port (perfect for TV), VGA output, a multi-card reader, headphone and mic jacks, and an Ethernet port. I have tested all of these, and they all work great. The Blu-Ray reader/burner is amazing, and all Dvd's are automatically made HD, which is a great feature.Track pad: The track pad is just about as big as a Macbook's, and has some gestures too. Asus is catching up to Apple, but Apple is still in the lead in the track pad department. The two keys (left and right click)aren't so hot. You have to click the very far left on the left-click, which is a bit annoying.CPU: The CPU is FAST - clocking in at 2.2 Ghz. It has quad-core processing, which is very helpful for those who need to run many programs at once. I haven't completely taxed it yet, and I don't plan too. Needless to say, it can handle all programs with ease.GPU: The Nvidia GPU (Nvidia GT 555m) runs everything fluently. So far, I have tried Team Fortress 2, DOTA 2, Uberstrike, and Borderlands 2. Here is a list of FPS for those of you who game.TF2 - High: 40-60 FPS Normal: 60-100 FPS Low: 100-150 FPSDOTA 2 - High: 75-90 FPS Normal: 80-100 FPS Low: 100-150 FPSUberstrike - High: 60-80 FPS, depending on maps Normal: Same as high Low: 80-150 FPSBL2 - High: 40-50 FPS Normal: 50-70 Low: 60-80If you are into gaming, such as running Steam, I HIGHLY recommend this computer.RAM: 8GB of RAM is more than enough to run even the most graphic-intensive or CPU demanding programs. Expandable to 16GB on this PC.Hard Drive: 1 TB is big, more than enough for me. It is partitioned into four drives, each has 250 GB. The hard drives are all spinning at 7200 RPM, which is fast, not as fast as the VelociRaptor, which is 10000 RPM, but still very fast. Again, more than enough room.Keyboard: The keyboard is a bit clacky, although I'm still getting used to it. I keep hitting caps lock when reaching for "A", but that's a minor detail. The volume buttons on the side are very helpful, I use them all the time. All in all, it's not bad. NOTE: Sadly, this keyboard is NOT BACKLIT. Take that into consideration if you live in a cave ;).Sound: WOW. Asus lives up to their standards. The free sub woofer is amazing, I use it when I'm gaming and watching movies. Bang & Olufsen ICEpower speakers are very nice, and the huge speaker bar at the front of the computer is a great touch.Bloatware: This computer (thankfully) doesn't come with too much bloatware. Most of it is very helpful, such as Nvidia Optimus technology, and other helpful programs.Problems so far: None. Of course, I had to wait a while for it to boot up, since there were 92 updates, but it's hasn't stuttered since.Overall: An amazing buy. I got my for $950, NIB, and it is amazing. Definitely a keeper.::K.H.::5.0::January 30, 2013

The left speaker seems to produce much less volume than the right speaker.so for anyone who has bought this asus can you tell me if your experiencing the same problem?Iam trying to figure out wether bang and olufsen desighned the left speaker to be lower in volume than the right speaker for better dynamic purposes? or wether iam just having a hardware or software problem?so please who ever owns this asus can you test your speakers by listening to them in a quite environment and determining wether or not the right speaker is louder than the left?thank you::Dave::4.0::December 12, 2011
R2DG241BBS5H2G::Asus doing well but could use more spasus...::I am enjoying my first month with the Asus laptop. My previous laptop was an HP Pavilion 15.5 inch glossy screen.  I really like the matte screen of the Asus.  As far as screen size, I debated going with the Asus 15.6 vs the 14.1 and decided the 14.1 would be better, given the lower screen resolution.  I am totally fine with this decision.  I am also very happy with the lightweight laptop and battery life with the standard 6 cell battery.  No doubt helped by the smaller screen real estate, I am getting a legitimate 5 hours of use.  This is compared to my old HP with a 12 cell battery (heavy) and getting only 2.5 hours.Also, the wifi is excellent as far as speed maintained and range.  I can easily get 25 feet away from my modem, through several walls and still get 80% of the highest speed that I would get standing next to my modem.Another plus is this laptop runs cool to the touch.  No more singed thighs.  And the "ice cool" technology also keeps the palm rest comfortable.My only two concerns with the Asus are keyboard related.  The keys are less contoured than I would like, so it is slightly easier to mistype. Having a little more space between them would be helpful.  Also, the Caps Lock key (as well as the other keys) lacks an LED indicator.  This could have been done and I would gladly have paid more for it.  These are minor complaints and would not keep me from recommending this unit.  Now, as to longevity...we shall see.5/4/12 update:  I need to downgrade from 4 stars to 2 stars.  ASUS product support is virtually non-existent.  Sent an email in to product support and it took six days to get a reply.  Website is in English, somewhat.  Went on to live chat today for support.  Nobody came online for almost thirty minutes.  Then a message appeared which said "engineers are busy, click here for support site".  So I clicked there and another message came up:  "Bad request".  So, I next called someone who tried to help but suggested I call back the next day to get an RMA.  I asked for my case number and he said he can't give me one as they were having problems with their software!I still like the laptop, but with non-support like this, I will not buy another product from ASUS.5/10/12 update 2:  Actually contacted by ASUS rep after seeing this post.  I like that they are willing to make improvements.  People just want to know that the company they buy a product from will actually care enough to support that product and improve satisfaction.  Upgraded from two stars to three stars.  I still like the laptop and am liking ASUS more, thanks to Tien.::Glory::3.0::April 16, 2012
R33J6NPYY21WXE::So far, so good.::Writing this review on this laptop right now:After some basic research on RAM, processors, etc., I decided to take a risk on this one (at the time of purchase, this had 2 stars). It had all the specs I was looking for (examples include: 2+ ghz, i5 core, reputable brand, upgradable ram, decent graphics card, icecool tech) for a very low price.Contrary to a previous reviewer, it worked right out of the box for me.It only took me an hour to see how much superior it was to my old laptop (an HP Pavilion dv4-1465dx). It's lighter/more comfortable, faster, has better graphics/sound, and doesn't try to burn me. Then again, the HP is at least 2-3 years old, versus ~3 months.I agree with a previous review on the annoying lack of LED indicator, but for the price, I'm willing to live without it. Although setting up the laptop with the Number Lock on was definitely something I'd rather not repeat.Now bear in mind, I've had this laptop for a VERY short amount of time, so I can't say much for durability other than it feels sturdy. If I run into any issues, I'll try to remember to update this review. I'll also try to update in a few months to update how well it takes my abuse as a college student.Feel free to ask me any questions about the laptop! I'm not the most knowledgeable about computers, but I'll try to be as helpful as I can.::Eileen::5.0::August 14, 2012
R23QUNLKXZO001::Actually..  The computer was a dudd!::Actually..  The computer was a dud!  But the company was great to deal with.  They shipped same day and sent the package overnight because I was leaving the country and needed it with me.  That was amazing! Then, it wasn't their fault that the computer was having problems and would reboot constantly and display windows error messages and try to reboot in safe mode and I hardly had any software on it at all.  I had my IT department walk through technical issues with ASUS and when the problems could not be resolved,  Adorama sent me the UPS labels and issued a full credit to my card!  Computer = bad..  Adorama = GREAT!::Wally & Deni Magno::5.0::May 15, 2013
R3PD0FJV22L3Z3::Asus P43E-XH51 14 " Laptop::As designed for professional use this laptop works very well,it feels very solid and high quality. I am very happy with it and I can recommend it to anyone.::Karl::5.0::May 3, 2013
R3ICIGLN5OHB5I::Defective out of box::Just got the Computer today to use for business and the screen won't turn on. Tried the Fn keys to see if the display was turned off. Hooked an external monitor to it and it worked fine. Tried different settings with the external monitor plugged in but the computer would not recognize its own display. Hopefully I can get a new one fast.::Joseph Meszaros::1.0::March 27, 2012
R99TUJUS7BINW::Don't buy.::The laptop worked for 2 hours and then the SSD died. I took it to repair and the guy told me that somebody opened it and replaced the 256 GB with a 128 GB SSD (which obviously was not even good because it died in 2 hours of normal use). If I could give it less than a star I would.::ATM::1.0::October 13, 2013
R3HUUK6C8LTB9V::One word, awesome!::This is an excellent laptop. Top of the line computing experience. It's light, powerful, and visually stunning. Highly recommended for anyone interested in MacBook Air.::A. Yayalar::5.0::June 11, 2013
R1PTP48KD4IE4V::Not the latest version::this aint the latest version, the box of the latest version is totally white.... the i7 processor is 2.0 GHz not 1.8... thats the 2011 model...::carlos::1.0::August 29, 2012
R3MRXY55KO8AHL::Big and heavy, but perfect.::I originally started looking at the ASUS G74SX-TH71 and other gaming-grade laptops when my wife and I decided to convert my sacred 'man cave' (office) into a nursery, and so the room no longer existed in our house for a desktop PC, huge glass desk, and triple 28" monitors. I definitely consider myself a gamer, and so I was skeptical about finding a worthy laptop replacement that didn't break my $1,500 maximum budget.Enter the ASUS G74SX-TH71. After much research, I decided on this machine mainly due to the cost vs performance ratio. Names like Alienware aren't important to me, and I was simply looking for the best system I could get for under $1,500.After having a few days to get acquainted with this PC, I have the following observations, both positive and negative, that I think might help others who are considering this system.*This laptop is big and heavy, relatively speaking. Weighing in at just shy of 16 pounds, this thing is a monster when compared to most other gaming laptops. And with 12.8"x16.5"x2.4" dimensions, it will only fit in all but the largest laptop backpacks and messenger bags. I myself bought a Targus XL to carry it, which is a perfect (but very snug) fit.*The Core i7/Nvidia Geforce GTX 560M (with a whopping 3GB of video and 12GB system RAM) are a lethal combination that is sufficient for 95% of your gaming needs. I am currently and mainly playing BF3, League of Legends, Cities XL 2011 and Empire Total War on this machine, and all of them run smooth. The big test for me was running BF3, and I was completely surprised to see how smooth this laptop ran, especially in multiplayer where it really counts. Dollar for dollar, I can't stress enough how great a value this machine is as a gaming laptop!*Lots of great features you'd expect in a high-end laptop, like blueray drive, integrated webcam, and useful (if not at least neat) software out of the box. I particularly like the ASUS SmartLogon feature, which uses facial recognition software to log you into your PC with the built-in HD webcam. Overall, the machine came with a minimum of bloatware that I had to remove, but I was annoyed by a lack of physical system restore media, which the computer prompts you to create.*Excellent heat management. Even after playing BF3 for and hour straight, the laptop itself is cool and the exhaust system is completely adequate. Which also bring me to another point...*Since the back of the laptop is taken up by the massive exhaust system, all ports are located on the sides. This can be a positive or negative, depending on how you look at it. I personally would have preferred the power adapter connection on the back of the laptop and not on the side.*The screen is big, bright and beautiful, but the anti-glare coating might turn some off if it's not your thing.*12GB of RAM out of the box, and another slot for 4 more! It also has a second HDD bay, which makes it easy to install an SSD to use as your OS drive for even better performance! These components are also easy to access and service, as it only takes unscrewing a single screw, and the whole panel pops out which allows access to HDDs and RAM all at once!The bottom line?As long as the sheer size and weight don't bother you, this is hands down the best value for your money you're going to find in a mid to high end gaming laptop. Sure, you can spend thousands more on something else. But this thing plays brand new, high-end, games coming out like BF3 with no problem, and has specs (and expansion capability) that put many higher-priced machines to shame. If you're on a budget, don't mind the size and weight, and need a laptop that you can play the newest games on, then look no further! Just make sure you also invest in a good product like the Targus XL or Everki Beacon to protect this beast when you're hauling it outside the home...::Jonathan Walters::5.0::October 27, 2011
R34B4ORA7YGACR::G74SX-TH71:  Blows away the Best Buy model (BBK7)::Was going out the door to Best Buy for the G74SX-BBK7 and decided to take another look online.  I was first disturbed it did not have a blu-ray drive, and then couldn't believe how I could get this and so much more with the G74SX-TH71 for just about $43 more after S/H vs tax.  So I just purchased the TH71 from Amazon (ships from TigerDirect).  Check it out.Price:  ~$43 more for the TH71 (1299.99 + 14.95 S/H = ~1315) vs BBK7 (1199.99 + 72 tax = ~1272).RAM:  12 GB in TH71 vs 8 GB in BBK7.Processor:  Newer/better i7-2670QM in TH71 vs i7-2630QM in BBK7.Video card:  both are Nvidia GeForce GTX 560M, but 3 GB in TH71 vs 2 GB in BBK7; I also read the video card in the BBK7 only has a bus width of 128 bits compared to 192 bits in the TH71 and other G74SX's.Display:  1080p HD resolution in TH71, not in BBK7Optical drive:  Blu-ray player in TH71, not in BBK7HDD:  The only sacrifice, get 500 GB in TH71 vs 1 TB BBK7.  Would much rather have all of the above features than a lot of empty hard disk space.  Plus there is an empty bay where a second HDD (or SSD) can be added to the TH71.Best $43 I ever spent.5 stars for value.  Will review performance once we've used it a bit.::Brian::5.0::January 22, 2012
R3238S84U02XEX::Laptop is very impressive!::I don't care about compact or lightweight, I wanted a laptop I could use as a home computer, would be portable if needed, and would never lag.  The Asus G74SX laptop is definitely a beast, but man what a powerhouse.  I got what I needed and more, wow!  Built well, screen resolution up to 1920, and tons of muscle.My wife summed it up when she said I had the Death Star of laptops.The **only** issue I have had so far (I have had the laptop for a week) is the mousepad is UBER sensitive... when I type without touching the mousepad it still senses input and moves the cursor on the text while I type.  I did a little research and found this is a occurring (don't know how common) problem with Asus laptops.  It was not an issue for me as I always use a USB wireless mouse, so I simply disengaged the in-keyboard mouse in the control panel...  problem solved.If this is the only problem I have with this laptop I will be happy with it for years.::Gary D Sell::5.0::February 28, 2013
R2Q9J4ZZGQ967K::ASUS G74S::The ASUS G-Series has handled everything I've thrown at it, with ease. Pound for pound, dollar for dollar the best PC I could have asked for for the price.::Alex::5.0::February 19, 2012
R1RXVFO16I6SOE::ASUS Beast!!!!!!!!!!!::Got it today, so far it has been everything it was advertsed to be, will update as time goes by.::Jonathanb::5.0::October 27, 2011
R1QV5PPMASUFOI::It's been such a great little laptop for the price!::I didn't expect this little laptop to run Office 2010 Pro very fast, but it performed very well. I didn't expect to set speed records running ArcGIS (heavy duty mapping program) but have successfully ran my mapping business for two years with few hitches, solely off of this laptop. For the price, this little brown laptop has made me an ASUS customer for the foreseeable future.I DID just buy a new 17.3" HP Z Book because the GIS software I use has limits on a laptop with such limited hardware resources. ASUS didn't have the sort of machine I needed or I would've gladly given them my business. But you can bet that the ASUS K53U will be riding around in my truck and in my backpack for a long time to come. (I HATE Windows 8 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)Perhaps the previous reviewers should look up PCTechBytes and learn to maintain their computers? Just a thought..If you need an affordable laptop, want Windows 7, and can luck across one of these, jump on it! I LOVE the brown color and the textures of the plastic. The keyboard has become my favorite style. I've loved its light weight and portability. Thanks for reading..::Danny Rowe "Danny"::4.0::January 5, 2014
RE7A8122SU1R6::I would avoid it::I have worked with computers long enough to understand that a 1.6GHz processor is not all that great, but I figured since it was a gift I couldn't complain, though it was awfully slow even when it was simply trying to pull up Google. I hadn't had it for much longer than 5 months before the computer's screen warped and then it shattered. I was completely frustrated with this horrid excuse for technology. I have a Dell b-130 with a Pentium M CPU(1.87GHz) with 2Gb of RAM that ran better and faster without the dual core and the 4gb of RAM that this thing came with. It is really not so much that it is an atrocity as it is just simply a bad computer even for the price that it was purchased at.::Gavin Acevedo::2.0::August 13, 2013
R3JX8MUD0ULIY::It's OK, but You get what you pay for::I bought the K53E at a local retailer two years ago for about $500 and it has been a great laptop until this week.  We don't do much gaming and all of the word processing and the like was done using Google apps.  This was used mostly to access the internet, occasionally stream Netflix and store Photos.  It was a good thing we had the last backed up to a cloud device because after just two years (almost to the day) the hard drive quit.  I expect more from a A computer than just two years of life.  The repair guy said that the Hard rive was stuck in a boot cycle and the it was a total loss.  I am going to try and replace the drive, and will see if that works, If it does then this is a four star computer (last week I probably would have given five) But if not the n maybe I should have left just two stars.  Over all  three and a half.::K. Frei "the_talon007"::3.0::February 14, 2014
RW5HR6XV3LX83::Lasted Less Than a Year::I knew that this was not going to be the best or fastest laptop but I did expect it to last more than a year.  It was very slow from the start and progressively got worse.  One day is just stopped working.  Asus was of no help.  I would do more research and invest a little more money for a better laptop that will last longer.::N. Oconnor::2.0::June 17, 2013
R29IU38EWMZA2W::High Build Quality, Overkill on Power, Lots of Extras::I got one of these laptops to set up for one of my relatives and I have to say for the price it is amazing. It has a very powerful graphics card (GTX 460). The laptop is of high build quality. It is a little bulky but it is very sturdy. I prefer sturdy construction to thin and breakable.The laptop is lightning fast and handles anything you can throw at it. The only downside is the garbage software that comes with it (but it comes with every laptop). After uninstalling it though the problem goes away. It is full HD resolution (1920x1080), and even has some extra features such as a back-lit keyboard. It also comes with the standard ASUS warranty which is 1 year accidental damage, 2 years parts/labor. No other manufacturer comes with a warranty like this out of the box, but in reality it's not needed, the laptop has very strong construction and looks exactly like a stealth fighter. If you are on the fence about this one, I recommend buying it. I have worked with computers and IT for 10 years.[...]::Douglas R. Gustafson "Suikoden --------- Star...::5.0::November 15, 2011
R30OJGU72WT2SC::SUPERB FOR GAMING!!!::This laptop is awesome, it is very fast and can handle practially all games out for pc rite now and more. asus has done a great job with this laptop. the 2 fans in the back grealtly help cycle the heat as well as the aluminum case helps absorb the heat and keeping the surface cool. very quite and fast. does not shut of due to overheating like some previous asus laptops.The best laptop in its category with a price to beat any other out there.Powerful, fast, sleek, quite and cool, simply amazing.::Haris::5.0::April 14, 2012

R1K0BQMP1RZHBY::clunky not that powerful overpriced::This is a pretty garbage laptop that doesnt pack much of a punch and is severley overweight and overpriced. The best part about this peice of trash is that the male end of the power source broke off in the female end of the laptop and melted off in the computer. that was about a year ago and i havent touched the thing since. One of the worst purchases Ive made::DAVID DEJESUS::1.0::February 15, 2014
R2UC9JIMJ82U0N::G-series::I'm sure this laptop would've been great, if I hadn't received it with a broken screen.  Sent it back and got a Qosmio with a larger screen, and couldn't be happier.::Mike::2.0::December 24, 2011
R1REIXGDANGZT1::Decent laptop at black friday price if you can get it.::So I got this laptop for 300 at Frys on black friday. It's not too bad a laptop if you get rid of HP's crapware, minus two or so relatively useful utilities. Keep in mind this laptop is not meant to do any heavy lifting, so no gaming, vid editing, etc. What it can do is movies, light gaming like java or the like, music, web, email, composition, etc. For the price, not bad. The touchpad throws me off. I'm used to having an obvious border; this one just uses a light tactile feel. It's also wide, something I'm not used to. It also uses the dual finger thing which I'm not a fan of but I'm pretty sure I can disable this. The hard drive speed is relatively slow in the world of performance. Again though, not a huge issue for what this is supposed to do. One thing that does bother me; the UAC performance. The whole screen goes black for about half a second, which throws you off. You'd think that with a core I3 processor and windows 7 64 bit this would be damn near instant. However, I believe this is an issue with intel video lagging.I'll possibly edit this in the future when I have more info.::J. Gil::4.0::December 3, 2011
R1PRK1MG0NF2L9::Nice Lenovo Laptop. Love the keyboard layout::Lenovo Thinkpads have always had the best keyboard layout in my opinion. This economy priced model has everything my college student needed at a great price. Unlike the Compaq CQ's and the low end HP series, this unit has Intel processor not AMD. You can get it with an AMD but why really? For the price point of this unit it feels great, not cheap. I like it so much I am going to order another one for me since this one is for my daughter in college.Shipping from this vendor was a little slower than others, but not unbearable. I guess Amazon's fast shipping has spoiled me.If you need a great value in a laptop, you might really like this model.::AnitaMargarita::4.0::March 6, 2013
R1BF170HDJJYQS::Revised: Broke after seven months, had to haggle Lenovo, pay for a diagnosis from a technician before Lenovo would fix it::REVISED again!!! SEE BELOWThe computer seems to slow down a bit sometimes when a couple applications are open which is why I gave it a four star rating but overall i am happy with the purchase^ABOVE is my initial review of this computer.However, after 7 months of very light use, windows is failing to boot and I am getting disk errors. Make note I bought this to have a second computer to keep at my house since I tend to leave my Toshiba at work.  Now I understand you get what you pay for, but I've had a Toshiba Satellite, that costs less than this Lenovo, for over 3 years without an issue, AND I use it all day at work, while the Lenovo gets less than 2 hours use a day if it's lucky. Anyway, I'm totally not thrilled. Hopefully, I get dealt with appropriately by the vendor and/or manufacturer and either get a replacement or speedy repair. After all, I understand electronics break down, but a company is only good as their guarantee/warranty/service on the products they make and sell.^Above is my first revisionI know we rate sellers here so I left a 4 star rating, because it isn't really the sellers fault that this computer was crap. If I was rating Lenovo, then I'd give them 2-3 stars. This was a manufacturing issue from the get go. The hard drive failed. I personally believe that when an item is under warranty, you shouldn't nickle and dime customers...do not try to charge me for technical support to try and fix my under warranty computer. Don't even try to troubleshoot over the phone... just send a UPS or FEDEX label, I'll ship it out to you, you fix it, and send it back.  I am good with computers, but not at fixing them. I got the run around for about a week from Lenovo about a computer that was 7 months old, barely used, and just died on me.  I called Lenovo and they tried to help me boot the computer. So at first they thought it was a software issue so they tried to teach me how to reinstall windows, it didn't work, so they sent me the discs to try to reinstall windows which took 3 days to arrive, it didn't work, so I decided to drive and spend $25 for a diagnosis from a computer technician thinking that maybe if I know what's wrong that I could forward that info to Lenovo and maybe they'd fix it. So I spent the $25 plus $10 in gas to drop it off and pick it up. Ohh, the hard drive failed. I called Lenovo, and from there, surprisingly they were great. Everything went pretty seemless, they got me the label, I sent it, they fixed it, and sent it back. So here's the deal. If you have a software issue with Lenovo you're on your own, but if you have hardware issue, you'll probably have to prove your case first, and spend several hours on the phone with different people transferring you to different departments. Ohh make sure you keep that reference number handy...you'll need it, alot.::John::4.0::July 20, 2013
R3PJ7AYBL94DJ8::The most beautiful laptop you can buy; a few shortcomings::First off, this thing is gorgeous.  It truly makes the prototype computer in the category, the MacAir, look frumpy. The feel of the laptop is first rate too; the computer feels very solid and perfect to the touch. Asus did a great job packaging the UX31: it's really nicely boxed with an attractive and functional sleeve, as well as a matching pouch for accessories.  I don't plan on using mine as a presentation laptop, but a direct mini HDMI and VGA port adapter are included.  Two USB ports, one of them USB 3.0, are available.  I think a USB 3.0 port is far more useful at this point than a Thunderbolt connector except in a very few cases (1. You have a Thunderbolt jack on your monitor,  2. You have one of the rare and very overpriced Thunderbolt connectivity external hard drives).The screen is sensational.  If your UX31 is closed, people can't help but notice the sleek design. If it's open, they'll be wowed by the screen.  The 1600 x 900 resolution is class leading, and the brightness is as well.  It's one of the few laptops you can use outside if you want.  Some have complained about the off angle viewing being sub-par.  In normal usage this is not an issue. How often do you use your laptop while looking at the screen from 45 degrees off to the side?  If you are buying a laptop to watch movies with a group of friends, this is probably the wrong computer for you.  But then, any laptop is probably the wrong computer for you.Like all computers with a solid state drive, boot up is amazingly fast.  Also like all thin SSD laptops, storage space is limited compared to a traditional hard drive.  This should be taken into consideration if this is intended as your sole computer.  I bought the 128 GB model, and will use my desktop as the primary storage site for data, photos, videos long term.  I think the UX31 will have enough space for my mobile needs, especially since I'm storing most of my music in the cloud with Google Music these days.Battery life, even with the screen brightness cranked up, is quite good. Charging is also fast with the well designed AC adapter. Unfortunately, in keeping with Asus tradition, the charging pin is small and feels inadequate compared to the rest of the device. The charging light on the plug that attaches to the computer will occasionally blink back and forth between red and green with the slightest of touches, indicating a so-so connection. It gets the job done, but should be better.The touchpad on my unit was initially overly touchy and somewhat erratic, as others have reported.  Asus responded promptly with an update, however, and that has resulted in good functionality for me.  I think most people would not think anything of it, pro or con, compared to other laptops.The facial recognition hardly worked at all when I first got my computer, but Asus has also promptly updated the drivers for that.  Since the update, it works most of the time.  It's a little gimmicky, but I've been having fun with logging on using facial recognition mode instead of a password (you can always use a password instead, of course).I think the biggest potential drawback to the UX31 is the keyboard. It is low profile, as necessitated by the overall design, and the keys can take some adjusting to.  I have found it fine for my purposes, but it could be better. If I was using my laptop primarily for intensive keyboard sessions like typing a PhD dissertation, or the like, I don't think I would recommend this laptop. For most general users, though, I think adaptation to the keyboard will occur fairly quickly. If you're not sure, you should try a test run, but keep in mind that it may take a day or two to totally get used to it.  I find that's true with most mobile keyboards I use.Overall, I love this laptop. The outstanding design and build, stellar screen, and excellent performance greatly outweigh it's shortcomings.  Especially for someone who wants to primarily run Win7, this is THE thin laptop to get right now.  Even Mac users will be seriously reconsidering their commitment to OS X; we have three Macbooks and an HP laptop in the family. My wife uses a Macbook, and has been jealously eyeing my UX31 since it's arrival. I am kind of glad they're in short supply right now--I really like having the coolest laptop in the house.::CAF::4.0::November 3, 2011
R3FNX3WCBPJK0U::Zenbook beautiful but poor quality control::I've been waiting forever for Windows laptops to finally catch up with the form factor/design of the Macbook Air. This time Intel and its partners deliver!I've owned a Macbook Air for the last 2 years and I definitely prefer this laptop to that Macbook Air (to be fair I don't have the current generation Macbook Air).The Asus Zenbook which looks like a macbook air Clone online does not look like a clone of the mac air except for the form factor.  The brushed metal look is definitely classier in person than it looks online. As far as performance goes -- so far it's been great. The instant on actually works (finally Microsoft!), the audio BLOWS away the audio on macs and is wonderful. The laptop does not seem to heat up while on my lap or on the sofa -- but I've only had it for 2 days.My only criticism of the laptop is the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is not backlit and is definitely not as nice to type on as the Macbook air. The trackpad was initially somewhat unresponsive, but when I called asus they suggested that i download new drivers from the asus website and voila the trackpad is working great now.EDIT: GT's review is accurate in that Asus shipped these with different components some better than others. I was lucky enough to get the ADATA SSD but had the Syntellic trackpad.I had to ship my laptop to asus a few times regarding trackpad, and eventually I simply asked them to replace the trackpad with the elantech pad and everything has been better since. The customer support was pretty good and the repair time was great. BUt it really should've have been shipped to me in the condition it is in now. 1 year later -- this is a better product today than it was when I bought it.::NYC outlaw::3.0::October 15, 2011
R35GFFK5YKK29L::Poor Keyboard and Touchpad downfall of Zenbook::Review title says it all. The poor keyboard and touchpad killed what would have otherwise been a lovely machine. As it is though, I simply can not do any work on this machine.Keyboard: I am a heavy typer and even after almost 2 hours of typing (i.e. trying to get used to the keyboard) I was still consistently missing keys here and there. By missing, I don't mean I wasn't pressing the key. I would press the key and nothing would register. The number of errors in typing I would make compared to normal increased significantly.Touchpad: I updated the BIOS and drivers for the touchpad (as well as a host of other updates including one for the wireless). The touchpad model I had was the Sentelic (there are 2, the sentelic and elantech), and the driver update I used was the most recent version 9.1.7.7, which on their download website is dated Oct 15, 2011.The driver update did help somewhat, turning what was a horrendously unusable trackpad to a subpar jittery trackpad. And in order to get the to that point, I had to turn off 'gestures' in the trackpad control panel--which means no trackpad scrolling. With all these adjustments, the trackpad still would occasionally jump from place to place, making mundane tasks nerve-racking.Franky, I simply could not do any productive work on the Zenbook. I really wanted to like this machine, but what is the point if you are constantly missing keystrokes and can't even highlight a piece of text without worrying that your cursor is going to end up on the opposite side of the screen.My overall rating was poor for the above reasons. Even though it is a nicely styled, fast machine with high res display, the cons far outweighed the pros for me.The 'Zenbook' did not give me peace of mind.::H. Izadi::2.0::December 4, 2011
R2NV53EOK2T1YO::Truly Great Ultrabook::Ultrabooks are the new Intel-configured "standard" to compete with the Apple MacBook Air.  I had been watching this space for a few months, anxious to replace my elderly XP Windows mini-tower.  I finally bit when I saw all that Asus is offering for $1,099. I had a number of must-haves and like-to-haves.Must:Minimum of 1600x900 screen resolution.  Asus is the only one I know of at this time that offers > 1366x768.  And the screen is 450 nits (meaning it is very clear and easy to read).Solid state drive with at least 128GB.i5 or better processorFast wakeup from sleep.  The UX31 is amazingly fast.  Wakes up about as fast as my iPad!  Unbelievable.> 6 hours of battery life.  This will definitely vary based on what you're doing (e.g. watching a movie will drain the battery in < 4 hours). I am a professional software developer, so I do some heavy-duty processing at times and I usually get around 5.5 hours before the UX31 warns me that I've reached 10%.Bluetooth.  I'd recommend a BT mouse in addition to the trackpad. The pad isn't bad, but if you're doing a lot of typing you will occasionally move the cursor unintentionally.< $1200.  Intel said that Ultrabooks should be < $1000, but the only ones that are so far are poor in some quality and performance areas (I won't name names, but don't confuse Asus and Acer).4GB+ of memory.Like to have:Nice looking.  The UX31 is very beautiful inside and out - even the bottom! Yet is very solidly built.Quiet.  This system is very quiet and doesn't get hot.  The venting is in front of the speaker behind the keyboard and out the bottom.Lightweight.  The UX31 is < 3 lbs.What's not so good?  All systems have drawbacks - here's my list for the UX31:- The keyboard isn't as good as I'd like.  It's not bad, but you definitely have to type more deliberately than a "regular" keyboard.- The battery isn't user-changeable.  You have to send it to Asus to service.Bottom line: I did all the research across all the companies (you should see my spreadsheet :P ) and the UX31 is the hands-down winner for this category of system.---As a side note, if you really want more than this, my larger laptop choice is the Dell XPS 15z. It is really a MacBook Pro competitor and costs a lot more than the UX31.I'd recommend the Plugable USB docking station and the Build laptop and accessories cases to go along with the UX31.  All purchasable on Amazon of course!And by the way, the UX31 is in short supply.  Don't give up - just keep looking.  I thought I'd have to wait weeks, but I found a place with it in stock and free shipping (I had it in two days!!).::Mark Lorenz "kewl!o"::5.0::November 15, 2011
R4TFCHPNJGHFN::Asus customer service disappoints.::I used to buy Asus productsd all the time. I recently bought a Zenbook. Great computer, until the power socket went bad. It took two weeks for them to get back to me with an RMA number. Had to pay for shipping, then the service center sent me an email saying they wanted me to pay for shipping back. Got it back, but had other problems.  6 weeks later, I have been able to use it for less than two of them. Their only answer is "Call and get an RMA and send it back for repair. They won't refund or replace it or send me a temporary to use.I will never buy Asus again.::Lousy Asus Customer Service::1.0::October 6, 2012
R2VOIBA9G4XKFY::Great Craftsmanship, Great Performance::I've had a few lower end laptops and one or two higher end laptops (at least they were when they came out) over the years, and this is easily my favorite laptop that I've owned.The good:- The build quality is great. Even though the laptop is very thin I barely notice since its materials give it a  sturdy feel.- The keyboard is solid. Before ordering this laptop I was a bit worried since I had read that the keys were pretty  shallow and didn't have a lot of travel. Granted, this is less of an issue for me since I tend to type heavily,  so this may be more of an issue if you type lightly.- The screen is beautiful and the large resolution really make a world of difference. The large resolution makes it  a lot easier for me to get work done. There can be a bit of a shallow viewing angle and if I'm showing someone  something on my screen I'll often have to adjust the angle. It's not too much work.- The speed. I opted for the i5 instead of the i7 and I'm plenty happy with the speed. The SSD is quick and the  laptop really does seem to boot almost instantly. I'm a software engineer and I often use this machine for work.  It has no trouble running visual studio, hosting a sql server, and playing whatever media I want to listen to  while getting work done. This is great for doing work on the go.- The speakers are a really nice unexpected bonus. I can't imagine needing a louder laptop than this one is capable  of going. Since I'm on the go quite a bit I generally find myself using headphones anyway.- Nice included accessories are also a bonus. The sleeve that come with this is nice enough for me not to shop  around for a new one. It has a magnetic flap that keeps everything secure.- Battery life is great. 7 hours is generous if you're actually doing stuff, but close to 6 with moderate  brightness/usage is no problem.The bad:- As I'm sure many have mentioned the trackpad can be a bit quirky. The multi-touch gestures work well, but I don't  find myself using them much. I find that I accidentally right click quite a bit, and when browsing the web it's  easily to accidentally zoom in and out by doing the multi-touch gesture.- The only other issue I can't fault Asus for since I obviously read the specs before buying it, but it'd be nice  to have another USB slot. If I'm using a USB mouse, and wired internet (which requires an included USB adapter),  I can't pop in a flash drive without unplugging the mouse. I'm not complaining as this is easily fixable by a hub  or bluetooth mouse, but it is something to keep in mind.All in all I am very happy with this purchase. The SSD is makes a world of difference. If you're really picky about touchy trackpads, I'd recommend trying one of these out in a store before buying it. I am not sure about how much more battery life the i7 eats up, or what use cases would require you to need the small amount of extra power, but unless you're someone that wants the best/fastest around just because, I can't see a reason not to go with this in favor of the more expensive model.::Tim::5.0::March 19, 2012
R33SVOHFU2TX8X::I so much wanted this to work::I just got my zenbook today, and I'm typing this review with it.  I so badly wanted this to work--I love the form factor, I love the battery life, and I love the speed.  Here is why I couldn't give it more than two stars.1)  I am a fast typist, that has used many different types of keyboards--bluetooth, laptop, notebook, netbook.  This is the only keyboard I have ever had a complaint about  It's not just about hitting the keys hard.  You have to hit them in the middle of the key or it *may not* register.  I'm not really a super picky person, but this keyboard really doesn't cut it.  what a shame.  One of the most important aspects of a computer is the keyboard input.  And I've never really had a complaint about any other keyboard I've used.2)  The sound was unbalanced, much louder on the left.  I checked the windows balance settings, and they are even.  I used different types of media and checked all software settings, I even called asus tech support.  They said return it to Amazon because an rma will take 15 days.3)  The trackpad generally worked well, but sometimes it would freeze, and not work.  I tried updating drivers, but nothing seemed to help.  It is terrible to be browsing the web, and have the trackpad freeze for 1-2 seconds.I did not install any additional software, I just started using the computer out of the box, and experienced the above problems.  For over $1k, I expect a much better quality-controlled product.  i'm really disappointed because this is exactly the kind of computer I need, but unfortunately the zenbook won't work for me.  It's going back to amazon.  anyone have any zenbook alternatives?  MBA doesn't work because i need a windows based system.::Amazon Customer::2.0::March 9, 2012
R2C4OTGCPH5YPN::A Spectacular Machine::When it finally came time to replace my 10 year old Compaq laptop I wanted to something brand new and "state of the art." My requirements were light weight, tiny size and portability. I looked at a number of different models and was honestly a little apprehensive about purchasing the Zenbook given its comparatively high price and the many negative reviews.I can honestly say that I am 100% pleased with the Zenbook after having used it for three weeks now. I don't know whether the other reviewers on here are simply too picky, but I have very few complaints about this extraordinary machine. (Plus, it's design and aesthetic is spectacular - it looks even better in person than in the pictures.)To begin I'll address what seem to be the common complaints:1) The touchpad: The only problem I've encountered with it is the fact that if you're typing and haven't used the touchpad in a few minutes, it takes a split-second to respond when you go to use it again. Sure, it might be slightly annoying, but it's hardly a dealbreaker. This "problem" is so inconsequential that I haven't even bothered to update the driver like many have advised.2) The keyboard: I do an ENORMOUS amount of typing for work and am extremely picky when it comes to keyboards. After reading all the poor reviews about the Zenbook's keyboard I fully resigned myself to the fact that I might have to return this computer if the keyboard sucked. However, it doesn't. I've found the keyboard not just to be 100% functional, but actually quite spectacular. I thoroughly enjoy typing on it any don't seem to have any of the problems with missed keystrokes that previous reviewers have mentioned.3) Wireless connection: Some have complained about dropped connections, a problem that I have not encountered even once in three weeks of daily use.4) Battery life: I seem to average about 7 hours per charge with general web surfing and word processing. That only drops to about 6.5 hours when I do more CPU intense image processing and such. So I'm completely satisfied with the battery performance.I'm not a person who is easily impressed by the newest technology. Especially after reading all the negative reviews, I was quite leery about purchasing the Zenbook. Despite my initial critical view and suspicion, I have to admit that it has not just lived up to my high expectations, but likely surpassed them. I understand that many of the issues with the keyboard/touchpad likely boil down to personal preference - not everyone will like the Zenbook, but I am thoroughly satisfied with it.::Corrian::5.0::January 9, 2012
R1MKFGHADFP5IQ::Everything great....but Keyboard::I've had the asus ux31 for a few days now and I've decide to return it. I can't stand the terrible keyboard that doesn't register every keystroke. You have to type right in the very center of the keys. By the time I'm done with this sentence I've had to press the backspace 25 times because keys won't register. I took a gamble to see if the keys registering would be a problem on my laptop and I lost.::ktchi::2.0::November 29, 2011
R1DX52WSNQQH72::ASUS ZENBOOK REALLY PERFORMS::This review will be posted with my opinions chronologically, and will address some common gripes with the laptopWhen I first received the laptop, my only (and fairly large) complaint was about the wifi. So the wifi would hiccup and lose connection every couple minutes...which can be really aggravating. But, after installing the new driver update I have not had a single issue since. I tested this by leaving pandora on for a couple hours, and it did not stutter or hiccup but rather was working just fine.By contrast, and much to my surprise, the trackpad worked with gestures like zoom and two-finger scrolling just fine. It is actually really nice and large. You can adjust various things to suit your liking and I see no issue with it.The keyboard was something I was certainly worried about before purchasing the laptop. I followed reviews about all the ultrabooks religiously and after numerous complaints about it, I was iffy about the laptop as a whole. Yes, I will admit the keys are a bit shallow, but no problem with missed keystrokes. Before this laptop I owned an asus eee pc and I certainly had to adjust to that laptop. This one is no difference.The power button is where the delete button usually is and this is going to take getting used to. But, like the mac trackpad two-finger scrolling in the opposite direction...its just a new layout to adjust to. Lastly, the viewing angles are only so-so, but, the screen has beautiful resolution that makes up for it.Overall, if you are on the fence about this laptop get it. It is light, gorgeous, robust, and seriously fast. Boot times are top-notch; the cpu is fast; the gpu is not bad for games either (played skyrim for about 19 hours with no problems or complaints!). This laptop has seriously grown on me, and I do not regret my decision whatsoever.cheers::Jennifer::5.0::November 24, 2011
R3SLRTJV2NDDK2::Great value, touch-pad drivers::I've been super happy with the purchase of my Asus UX31E REFURB.The case that comes with the laptop is a form-fitting brown plastic-cloth sort of number. While the case looks terrific (and is small!) you can't jam accessories into it. Therefore, the power supply and mouse, if you have one, would be kicking around separate from the laptop. I got a Case Logic that's roomy enough Case Logic LAPS-113 13.3-Inch Laptop / MacBook / MacBook Pro Sleeve (Black) to jam a blue-tooth mouse Logitech V470 Bluetooth Cordless Laser Mouse (Blue) and power adapter into.The biggest complaint that it appears people have is the touchpad. Initially I installed ubuntu 12.04. The "universal" touchpad drivers aren't all that great. The touchpad is way too sensitive. BUT then I broke down, as I always do, and moved back to Window 7. Be sure to install the Asus Elan Touch-pad drivers [...]. You can disable all the annoying things about the touchpad, and it works great.The laptop has no optical drive, so you're going to have to put your Windows 7 installation on a flash drive. This will be impossible if you don't already have the disc! I ended up wiping the whole thing, and borrowing a Win7 CD from a friend that was the correct version to the OS sticker on the bottom of the laptop, Windows 7 Home Premium Refurb. Once you get an installation cd, and a nice big flash drive, you can follow these directions to get the entire Windows 7 installation onto a bootable flash drive. These instructions should do the trick: [...]Overall - great purchase. Handsome laptop, good battery life, and quick operation. I'm sure it will serve me well for a few years into the future.::drew kerlee::4.0::June 21, 2012
R2KCFC65RM3OL7::Holy cow this is horrible::The worst laptop ive possibly ever owned. Ultrabooks are a complete joke and especially ASUSYou could get 4 differnt types of this modelWhen asus sent these units over to tomshardware and other places to benchmark they sent ADATA's which were apparently less reliable but having almost 2x to 4x the speed.Also the track pad was at much better quality.So when buying this u nit you take a gamble to get the right configurationyou can either getBad trackpad and ssdgood ssd back trackpadbad trackpad bad ssdor GOOD BOTHGuess what i got?BAD FOR BOTH!So many wonder why asus does this?Its to save cost so they don't have to RMA our units. SSD"S have a typical life of a few months to a few years but they don't last the life a typical hard drive will. with the warranty on this unit being over a 1 year asus has to use a longer lasting Sandisk ssd.Now dont get me wrong sandisk makes awesome ssd's but however hte model ASUS has OEm'd is a long lasting and much slower versionPlus asus rma is headache so dont even bother::fasty buyers::1.0::June 17, 2012
RZOG5ZK9OPYJS::Sleek but flaky::Superficially it looks great, but there are big issues with the keyboard and track pad.Keyboard issues'  1. Not registering keystrokes (perhaps 1 out of every 15 keys is unrecognized, so very annoying).  2  When letting go of the shift button, there is a minuscule delay until the keyboard recognizes it. Doesn't sound  like a big problem, but when I type my password (which has uppercase letters) quickly, as I normally do, the shift modification carries over to the next letter in the password. The result is that I have to enter the password 3-4 times before it's correct, a problem I've never had with any other keyboard. The only effective fix has been to type much slower.Track pad issues:  1. If you intend to use any other OS than the preinstalled Win 7, you're out of luck. The track pad is entirely unusable without the right drivers.  2. Even with the right drivers, its behavior is flaky at best, exhibiting phantom clicks every now and then.  3. The scrolling gesture does not give smooth scrolling.It's a shame about the keyboard and track pad, because they're the only weaknesses I've found, but they're also the most fatal weaknesses a laptop can have.::zpah::2.0::May 31, 2012
R3UGL8ZTJW385X::Asus Zenbook  vs. Macbook Air::ASUS Zenbook UX31E-DH72 13.3-Inch Thin and Light Ultrabook (Silver Aluminum)After 5 months of struggling with the new Macbook Air, it finally died after over heating every time it was turned on. Apple, had to send it in for a replacement, which I will sell.I purchased the Asus Zenbook, a few hours later. WHAT A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. Maybe they have learned from mistakes, but there is not one thing I can complain about, and I am very fussy when it come to my technical products. I picked mine up at Sam's Club, and it is a perfect. I was very concerned after all the reviews, and was looking for the 90 day return policy. This Zenbook, will stay with me for at least a year---longest I seem to keep anything.Don't be afraid to try it, and stay away for Macbook Air, unless you want to be working out of a little box.::Patricia A.

RJZHF8AQEAV86::"Loaded, leather, Moonroof"::I have used the UX31 for a month now and plan to use it on our travels so I can connect to my office.In a word: wow.  This is one serious, gorgeous and fast computer. I use GoToMyPC and run my office PCs as fast as they usually run.there has been no quality or buggy issues whatsoever.The boot times are astonishingly fast and I have demo'ed it for some techie /Apple lovin' friends.They have all been stunned by how fast it is; how good it looks and how beautiful the screen is.I leave it hibernating between uses and the little ASUS gauge tells how much standby time it has.I will use it for email, browsing, banking etc for 30-40 min / day and i charge it ONCE A WEEK.bottom line: A definite buy.Just note it is all 64 bit so make your software can keep up. I run our proprietory 32 bit apps remotely with GoToMyPC.The keyboard is not perfect for touch typists (me) so it loses a star.But a solid 4+ stars for doing everything else right for travel / remote computing.::Amazon Customer "breathe"::4.0::March 16, 2012
R3L2ICHN1S94FD::Just short of perfect::Just got mine.  It's a beautiful piece of hardware.  Much has been made of the distinction between the two flavors of SSD.  I have a slightly different perspective on it.  I'm coming from years of using notebooks with rotating media.  I have spent way too much of my life waiting for Microsoft Windows to take agonizing minutes -- trillions of operations at today's clock speeds -- just to boot up.  I pulled a Sandisk SSD on my Zenbook, and my machine cold boots in maybe 15 seconds or so.  Even better, the notebook can sleep for well over a week.  So the normal use case for this machine is to just put it to sleep, e.g. by closing the lid.  When I open it up, bam!  The unlock prompt is waiting.  So for me, even with the "slow" SSD, living with this notebook is fundamentally different and light years better than a traditional notebook!Nothing is ever quite perfect, though, so here are a few observations:  The keyboard seems very high quality.  However, it does require noticeably more force than most keyboards to actuate, and I find I get missed keystrokes, and sometimes I slip off the intended key while pushing on the smooth metal.  I pulled the Elantech touchpad with my Zenbook.  It is a little finicky, but in general it's just fine.  It is extremely sensitive, so that sometimes I wind up clicking on things when my intent was merely to scroll or move the pointer.  The only real 'bug' I've noticed is that, sometimes when I try to two-finger scroll, it keeps popping back to the beginning/top of the page.  I think the biggest, albeit minor complaint for me is the screen.  It's hard to say exactly, but while my screen appears razor-sharp, its color seems to be a little "washed out".  The cartoon colors in graphics all look fine, but I've noticed in photographs that the colors seem less distinct and vivid than on other computers I have.  For me this slightly washed out appearance creates a sort of hazy impression for me.All in all, though, I am delighted with my Zenbook!::Peter::4.0::March 9, 2012
R21A8H4PK8XBOD::Not impressed::Keyboard lacks responsiveness and touchpad is so-so.  I am disappointed with the keyboard.  You really need to bang on the keys to make sure you don't skip a key while typing.  Also, the touch pad gets stuck sometimes and the cursor wanders to another part of the screen sometimes.  I also had to send the laptop back for repair a short time after receiving the laptop.  The display/screen failed and I had to return the laptop.  I regret having picked the Zenbook over the Apple Air. A little bit more money and you get what you pay for.::kikster::3.0::February 20, 2012
R39JL2Z7D0QW4D::I'd recommend to a friend::Mine is the i5 version with a 128 GB SSD.Asus did a great job with the UX31E. It's a sleek, sexy, incredibly thin laptop, but still no match for the refinement and sophistication of a MacBook Air, which I also own. Of course my Asus is considerably cheaper than the Air - $1,000 for the Asus, about $1,500 for the Air when I bought it.The Zenbook's keyboard takes some getting used to. Some have complained about the keyboard, but it wasn't a difficult adjustment for me.The touchpad so far isn't even the same league with the Air's. But I've only been using the Asus for a couple of days, so maybe I need to learn more about it and add my personal tweaks. I use a mouse mostly, so the touchpad is not a big issue.I find it harder to read on the Asus screen than on the Air. Maybe it has something to do with screen resolution. But I should be able to make the adjustment. I just need to remember to Windex my eyeballs every morning.The front corners of the Zenbook feel sharp. I guess this would be a plausible explanation for slashed wrists at a hospital emergency room.Glad it has at least one USB3 port (there's a second USB2 port), a Micro-HDMI port (which the Air lacks).Oh, the sound system. It's fantastic. I hate laptops with feeble audio. The Zenbook's audio (Bang & Olufsen) is actually loud enough to be practical.For those who insist on a Windows operating system, the Asus UX31E might be an ideal, extremely thin, light and practical laptop.::E. Minor::4.0::January 16, 2012
R3HQEDWSYAX511::A good laptop; but not perfect::I just got my laptop yesterday, so these are just some initial thoughts.The good things:First, it's biggest draw is the fact that it's light and that it performs. It's much lighter than I thought (feels lighter than a macbook air, although I know they're supposed to be the same weight). And it's much faster than I thought. I bought the slower CPU because I didn't think it was worth an extra $400 for an extra 100MHz of clock speed; and I was right. This processor actually is faster than some of my desktop computers that have chips benchmarked to go much faster than the i5 2557M. It even handles processor intensive programs like Photoshop reasonably well -- good enough to work on the road if need be. And even though I think I got the "slower" SSD, it doesn't seem to noticeably impact performance.Second, the screen is beautiful. I wondered whether to get the smaller UX21 screen with less resolution, but the resolution on the UX31 is breathtaking.Third, I have no problem with the keyboard. It does drop keys once in a while, but you feel it when it drops keys. And I have no problem with the touchpad. I think the multitouch might be patent infringement, but we'll let the courts decide that.Fourth, I like the idea of their accidental damage warranty. I haven't damaged the laptop yet, so I don't know if they'll honor it, but on paper it sounds great.With that said, it is missing a few features that would make it more convenient:First, you can't lock the laptop with a laptop chain. Given -- I rarely bother do to that. But I'd like the option to. I mean, how hard is it to cut a small hole in the chassis for the laptop lock?Second, the keyboard is missing keys. I don't mind the low profile of the keys or the fact that it's backlit (i touchtype, so I can find the keys as long as I feel the 'F' and 'J'), but it's missing the 'home' and 'end' keys. Which I use often. And the delete key is next to the power button; I'm constant afraid I'm going to accidently turn off the computer.Lastly, the laptop lid (where the monitor is) needs a bit less give. If I bounce the laptop on my knees while the screen is open, the lid falls backwards. It doesn't fall very far because it can only open to a 120 degree angle or so. But there should be more friction holding the screen in place.Other than that, I'm pleased.::Jason Tien::4.0::January 6, 2012
R2T9CANTMLI3NH::looks great, but in the end it fails::This is a thing of beauty, but laptops need a few key things to really work well and these things depend on how you use it.  I touch type, and I need a keyboard that does not miss keystrokes.  there is nothing more frustrating in the world than to have to shift focus to making sure you are doing something differently, especially like typing.  I've almost never met a keyboard I didn't like, but this one has my fingers in spasms and convulsions.  the thing is it sounds like you are typing but the keystroke can make a noise, but not register.  this is especially apparent on the larger keys like the enter button, but it seemed to happen randomly throughout the keyboard on various words.  writing any code, especially javascript with all it's {}[]()'s was a nightmare.  I think if you touch type you should really go look at one in the store and pull up a flash typing game to test how accurate your typing was.  I gave it a day or two and really wanted to love it, because the screen is great with a nice pixel density.The trackpad, while not great isn't that bad.  I got the elan one, and the sandisk ssd.  I didn't notice any slowness on the ssd.I had a few other nitpicks like the lack of 5Ghz in wifi, the placement of the delete key right next to the power button, and the lack of backlight.The only other issue I had was with the thinness of the front, it just seemed to be pushed away with my wrists while in bed.  The corners are also a bit sharp and uncomfortable.I ended up returning the ux31 and getting 25% off a series 9 at the microsoft store, and I bought it for the keyboard but the device is very nice in every other way, it also has a matte screen, it's lighter, and it has a backlight for the keyboard.::Jesse D Schoch::2.0::January 2, 2012
R2F7ZB5RVP3CJZ::Terrible Support from ASUS::After completing the setup on my brand new zenbook, I noticed the camera would occasionally "disappear" and for no reason it would "reappear". After a couple days, the camera failed to work completely. I knew it was a hardware problem, but it took 3 phone calls with ASUS support, and a complete reset to factory state before they would acknowledge a hardware defect.At this point, ASUS issued an RMA and I shipped the machine to ASUS for repair or replacement. I should have just returned to the vendor for an exchange, but they were out of stock at the time and I felt ASUS should be responsible anyways.As of the writing of this review, ASUS has had my machine for OVER ONE MONTH, and they are unable to give me any estimate of when I will get my machine back. Each time I call they tell me that I will get an update within 24-48 hours, but I have yet, in a full month, to be contacted even once by anyone from ASUS.ASUS will not replace my defective machine, and they are unable to repair it.  This is the last time I will buy an ASUS product.I strongly advise against depending on the ASUS warranty for anything.  Dealing with their service department has been a nightmare.::TommyT::1.0::September 10, 2012
R3DR1HGL0WW9PF::Worst keyboard / touchpad ever!::I love this laptop: Performance is great, design is great and I don't have problems with WiFi et. al (latest BIOS / drivers installed). Can't say much about the Sandisk SSD Performance issue, but I scored 3.300 PCMark 7 marks, so I guess this should be about right.BUT: What a flawed keyboard / touchpad. Asus! Seriously, what were you guys thinking???@ Keyboard: In short: Horrible typing! Keys are waaay too far away from each other.- Fairly often the keys don't react properly although you've pressed themArrow keys are waaay too small (yeah, great design, Asus! Have you thought about functionality?).- No dedicated page up/page down button (same as above: design first, then functionality).I doubt that I'll get used to this. I'll try my best within the next week but will probably send it back.@ Touchpad: OMFG! Asus, what the hell were you guys thinking? I read lots of reviews before buying this laptop and thought "c'mon, it can't be that be that bad". But when I actually started to use it I couldn't believe what I found. Asus just shouldn't have tried to imitate the Apple Touchpad. Of course I can use a mouse while working on my desk, but this touchpad will annoy me whenever I'm traveling.- The touchpad is just waaay too big. You cannot write a text without deleting sentences because you accidently mark text with your palm while typing and erasing everything you've typed. This was improved a bit with the latest driver (they increased the "dead zone", but it still happens waay too often.- When you tap the touchpad to perform a left-click the delay is just aweful. I presume that because of all this swipe-gesture-interpretation-intelligence integrated into the touchpad hardware it just takes a while to interpret the tap as a click. I don't see how this can be fixed with a driver update.- Why on earth did Asus decide to build in a touchpad that has no left/right mouse button that can be "felt" with your finger, i.e. by separating it from the capacitive area? Because the "border" between the two buttons is just printed on the touchpad itself you cannot "feel" the buttons and therefore quite often perform a leftclick instead of a rightclick, a rightclick instead of a leftclick, or move the mouse instead of clicking.- Due to the fact that the touchpad, including the two "buttons" (which are no real buttons but just printed on the touchpad itself), is just one big area with just one "clicking" switch underneath there's another annoying flaw: When you perform drag and drop and want to release the left mouse button by lifting your finger from the area that is supposed to be the left mouse button, the switch below doesn't recognize this. Why? Well, even the tiny weight of your other finger (on the touchpad itself) is enough to prevent the switch underneath from releasing. Funny, huh?In short: Don't buy this laptop if you intend to type on the keyboard or use the touchpad. If you don't, well, I'm sure you'll like it... ;)::SirDaedalus::1.0::September 7, 2012
RYS9MUEOQKISA::Great ultrabook, worth much more than the sale price::I bought this ultrabook as a replacement for my laptop back in January. My old laptop was a Core 2 Duo 2.2 ghz with an nVidia 9800m GT video card, and it cost $1600, which was a steal at the time.The zenbook absolutely blows it out of the water. I expected there to be issues playing video games since the video card isn't dedicated, but it significantly outperforms my old machine. I moved down from 15.4" to 13" with this upgrade, which took a bit of getting used to, but I'm glad I have the smaller screen now.Pros: + Fantastic performance + Great price + Very impressive battery life (slightly less than is advertised, but still very solid) + Surprisingly good build quality + Ridiculous boot speed. I'm powered on and logged on in under 15 seconds. + Very light, thin profile, but by no means fragileCons: + The trackpad behaves a bit strangely and took some getting used to. Once I got used to the multitouch functionality it improved, but I think there may be a design issue here + The keyboard sometimes does not recognize input if you don't press the middle of the key solidly. Annoying sometimes, but not painful by any meansI would and have recommended this laptop others: for the quality, performance, and price, you cannot do much better. I will be purchasing Asus products every chance I get from now on.::Brian::4.0::July 26, 2012
R309OSH62EKOY8::Beware of ASUS::I don't understand why people are liking ASUS brand computers. This is my second laptop from ASUS, the first being a Republic of Gamers. The biggest issue i have it the keyboard on both. Although the specs are respectable, there issomething wrong with the keyboard. Key presses are not registering along the the space bar. I have to forcefully press the key and just at the center of each key including the space bar. Furthermore, the cursor would suddenly jump to a random spot at whatever i am typing. I refuse to carry aroundanother keyboard, as itdefeats the purpose for having a notebook. I obviously like asus at one point, or I would not have bothered buying another one. And to top it all off, customer service is non existent. After inquiring numerous times about the keyboard, i never gota single response. And for those that think that keyboards are not that important, try writing a paper with it. You will be pulling your hair out.::J. deCastro "hydramine"::1.0::June 13, 2012
R37HKPX2J3K9UB::ASUS Zenbook UX31::I've had my UX31 for about a week, and I'm so far having a very positive experience.  I'm surprised about the trackpad complaints.  Mine works very well.  It's big, precise, and has a nice click surface.  As I learn the extended gestures, they turn out to very useful (not just fancy gestures for their own sake).I understand the complaints about the keyboard which has a light touch and takes a bit of getting used to.  However, after some use, I think more keyboards should be like this.  Just type a little softer.  Remember how hard you had to press the keys on the old manual typewriters?  Maybe this is the keyboard of the future.  (I think ASUS has made improvements to the trackpad and keyboard, and if it was Apple people would think these were brilliant innovations.)This computer has a fantastic screen.  It's not just the specs (1600 X 900 resolution, 450 nits), but it is just plain pleasant on the eyes.  There are a number of ways to modify screen settings.  Besides the Control Panel, there is an Intel Graphics application and an ASUS application named Splendid.  For simplicity and convenience, you can just press fn + C and it will scroll through various color presets--very similar to preset colors on an HDTV. These include Normal, Gamma Correction, Vivid, Theater, and Soft.  Pretty cool!And like the screen presets, you can also scroll through various power presets with hot key combination fn + space bar. Power presets include High Performance, Entertainment, Quiet Office and Battery Saving modes.  Again, these are convenience pre-sets, and you can access more detailed power settings via the control panel or an icon in the system tray.  (I have mine set for High Performance when it's plugged in and Battery Saving when it's not.)The claims about the UX31's performance are not exaggerated.  Mine powers up in fewer than 15 seconds, and the 2-second resume from sleep is for real.  Everything is very snappy even though I have Norton 360 running in the background monitoring every file and process.A negative for me is that it only came with 128 gigabytes of storage. After installing my required applications, I'm only left with 69 gigabytes of free space.  I like the speed and durability of a solid state drive and I definitely make use of cloud storage, but not having the space available is an inconvenience. Another negative is that the face recognition software doesn't work very well. I'll give it time to "learn" and see how it goes.The ASUS engineers really put a lot into the design of the Zenbook.  I really like my new Ultrabook, and I will keep an eye on other ASUS products.UPDATE 12/2012Got to admit, the keyboard is irritating. I think that it's the large track pad.  Thumbs and the inside of the hands keep hitting the trackpad causing havoc in the application.  It's simple to remedy by keeping the thumb sides of your hands turned a little upward, but because I use other computers for work, I'm inconsistent.  Slight pain. No other problems.I installed Windows 8.  Of course, this computer doesn't have a touch screen, but it still works pretty well with the mouse.  Takes a little practice.  No problems with Windows 8 upgrade except that ASUS isn't yet providing any updates to it's utilities to make them Windows 8 apps.  You have to run them on the Windows 7 desktop.  I guess there's no profit in making older models current.I've been watching movies in HD on the 13 inch screen.  Very good quality. I've watched some very fast-paced action movies, and everything was perfectly smooth.  Sound quality is also good, but I prefer to plug in a headset.  Bluetooth headsets also work.::Randell J.

R3HMB9460JI8W7::AMAZING!::Great product, great price, great shipping!This laptop SHAMES the MacBook Air. Lower price, bigger screen, higher resolution, better ventilation, longer battery life, AND the ALL-damages covered warranty? I could drown, burn, or beat this laptop to death and for one year, it's covered by an all-damages warranty. THANK YOU Asus! Nice to know that there's a company out there who puts their customers before their own gains.::Amazon Customer "Jill Robbins"::5.0::February 19, 2012
R2G8TSJ1I2WKST::Excellent Laptop::Pros:-Small dimensions (including weight)-Fast-Looks Good-1600x900 screen resolution-Connectivity dongles and carrying case included-Long battery lifeCons:-128GB SSD is limiting-Track-pad is hit and missI originally purchased this in order to be able to do work on the go (I am a college student studying computer engineering and math). This machine is lightweight and powerful and let's me run all my technical software without getting bogged down. The SSD permits incredibly fast boot times, data retrievals, and wake from sleep times but 128GB is pretty small especially considering the space that the OS and software take up although smaller media collections shouldn't be a problem. The battery lasts surprisingly long; even at near full brightness I can easily get over 5 hours and that includes running CPU-taxing software. The track-pad has some interesting default features and options that make it initially hard to use (most notably "magic touch" and inertial scrolling), once I disable those however the touch-pad was fine. The high resolution screen makes it easy to read without sacrificing space. From a productivity standpoint I couldn't be happier. As for the aesthetics the Zenbook is sleek and cool looking and easily competes with anything Apple has to offer (with better features and a lower price to boot!) Frankly this is the best Ultrabook for the money.::dT::5.0::January 30, 2012
R1O330IOSL9WUO::Good value. Annoying details.::I'm not as tech savvy as most of the other reviewers, and most of their comments are spot on. I purchased mine from BB. It has a different part number [UX31-RSL8]. Not sure if there is any difference. BB listed the color as Radiant Silver. I wish they would state what it is: Dark gray. As for the Asus updates, it does sound like they rushed this unit out the door. On the Asus site there are 27 updates available. Everything from trackpad to bios. I have no clue which ones to download,[Any tips?] so I only did the ones that were in the popup from Asus when the computer is first used. One was the track pad update and this has helped somewhat, but there are others on the Asus site. Now the pad is too sensitive. Attempted scrolling often becomes an unintentional tap. I see no provision for any adjustment of pad sensitivity. Adding a mouse does not help when I use it on my lap.  The screen is very sharp, but my last netbook, [Asus S-101] had a matt screen. I miss the matt screen a lot. This screen is like a mirror and detracts from the viewing experience. To use this laptop on a desk is fine. However,I usually use it on my lap, like when sitting on a couch. The sharp edges and corners of the deck are sharp enough to cut my palms. Why couldn't they bevel these edges? For me, this is a serious flaw. The SD card slot only allows the card to go in half way. The S-101 hid the entire card. WiFi performance is fine, but I did go into the advanced settings in Power 4 Gear and change the wireless card setting to full power. It had a desktop display gadget for P 4 gear, but I somehow lost it and can't find a way to retrieve it. I miss it because sometimes it goes into battery saving mode for no reason. I worry about the life of the tiny AC plug. It looks too fragile.  Even with all these gripes, this is a great computer with top notch performance.::Jermar::4.0::October 27, 2011
R3JEI7OUKTXNQV::biggest crap EVER::DO not buy this pc. I hate it. The touch pad is weirdly reacting, the wifi turns constantly off by itself.....I so hate it. It loses its settings and the keys are not lit up. Maybe, my description is not detailed or defined enough But this pc is driving me nuts. I still have it, can't afford new one, but wish I would have never bought it. I bought it for its weight, slimness and reviews I read on the internet. The speakers I do not even use. Och, get out of here. Glad when I can afford a better machine::TNTankgirl::1.0::April 26, 2014
R267FIQ8DV2W3E::So disappointed with my purchase.::Hard Drive Nightmares!!! The disk drive regularly freezes at 100% in the Windows Task Manager. This basically means I have to turn the machine off manually, because the entire system freezes. This happens about 2 - 3 times a day, when I'm in the middle of working on documents + presentations. Unable to save the latest changes because the performance of the computer simply stutters to a halt.I would avoid buying ANY laptop with the Asus brand name on it.PS: My computer is still under warranty. The suggestion from Asus tech support: I must reinstall the operating system. Guess what buddy, I did that ages ago - having been on Windows 7, then Windows 8 - and the problem still occurs. That was the best advice I received.It seems even if you ask Asus for support,they cannot / will not help you. I'll never buy another Asus product again and I would caution you to be careful when next considering your purchase of an Asus product - because both hardware AND warranty support have not helped me.::Ken E. Baker::1.0::April 11, 2014
RE3HLWHJLB18Y::Terrible - 6 months old and does not boot::Seemed like a great alternative to the Mac Air, but unfortunately, you get what you pay for.  After only six months, the ultrabook no longer boots up.  The power light goes on, but the display stays dark.A quick search of Asus UX31 not turning on shows that this is a broad issue.::RacerX::1.0::January 25, 2014
R3A4WOZW8INPD5::Poor quality, RMA 3 times - bad return experience::Do not get one of these: it WILL fail eventually due to poor quality and the RMA process is terrible. Save yourself the hassle and get something else.It started out so well: looks nice, portable, very nice screen and fast. We were able to live with the twitchy touchpad after a BIOS update. But then we started having problems. The laptop started emitting a high-pitched screech. It went in under warranty. Came back only a little better.Then 3 months out of warranty, the screen crapped out. Back to ASUS this time we had to pay for the repair. But ASUS returned the box to us unopened! We called and discovered that the ASUS repair facility was overwhelmed. Not a good sign, indicates poor quality is common. They simply returned it because they were busy! We returned is again and finally over a month later got it repaired.Now we are experiencing random freezes when we unplug and go on battery. We will not repair this again. It's going in the trashcan.::W. Hale::1.0::January 20, 2014
R1IECJLDY2ZED5::Asus Zenbook UX31E-RSL8::I was looking for a light-weight thin laptop to use on vacations so I wouldn't have to lug my 8-year-old bulky, 9 pound Dell around any more.  I looked for laptops at Fry's and the Asus looked really nice, shiny, thin and lightweight.......which it certainly is.  I took it on vacation and found out that the keyboard won't register if you type fast...I thought it was ME at first, and I tried hitting the keys harder....didn't work, just made me more frustrated.  Then the touch-pad was another story.....you can tap the pad instead of doing a normal "left-click" which is really convenient.....except that the pad is too sensitive and thinks I'm tapping when I just want to swipe to move the arrow, which results in all kind of unwanted results and frustration.  When I returned from vacation, my 30-day return period had expired, so I got rid of it on the secondary market.  No more Asus products for me ever.::genie at WC::2.0::October 28, 2013

R37XKSE703YH02::Don't be fooled by the sexy shell... this notebook is not a keeper::First of all, the good stuff: This notebook is light and thin, making it great for traveling.  The display is pretty decent and it has an HDMI output.  It's powerful enough for day to day use and even some light gaming, and it works perfectly with Ubuntu.Now the bad stuff: The keyboard is atrocious.  There's really no way around it.  I've gotten more or less used to it now, though that means I'm still having 1-2 keystrokes drop out every sentence or two.  The trackpad is... okay at best.The horrible stuff: When the system is under high load (gaming, major processing, etc.), removing the power cord results in an immediate shutoff.  Not a shut-down -- it simply powers off as if it had no battery.  This would be an annoyance if it weren't for the fact that the power cord loosens up enough after about six months that you need to rest the notebook on a flat surface and have a keyboard and mouse on a totally different surface so as not to slightly jar the machine.  A vibration such as a good solid tap on the touchpad is enough to make the power cord fall out and the machine crash entirely.I personally won't be buying another Asus after this experience.::Ronald McCollam::2.0::May 29, 2013

R3I3P0LMR2FKUO::Fantastic Ultrabook::This little laptop (Ultrabook) is fantastic. It is pretty much everything that is advertised. It is extremely fast and has some great features. It boots in about 10 seconds from a cold start. The battery can last for about 12 hours strait (In my experience) while watching streaming video. There is no disc drive of any kind so just be aware of that. It is extremely thin and light for it's power and the screen is pretty nice and crisp when viewed straight on. For angled view the screen can appear to have blacked out portions.When I first got this I had some kind of error that caused the computer to not boot and give a very scary warning. But after letting it rest and restarting a couple of times I have never had this problem again. The touch pad is also sometimes not very responsive and sometimes in the beginining it actually stopped altogether. Both the criticle boot error and the touch pad problem seemed to go away with updates installed.The sound for this computer is fantastic for the size of the frame. There is virtually no distortion and the lows and highs are easily distinguishable. Of course it always helps to connect to a larger set of good quality speakers but for the size the sound from the built in speakers is fantastic. Better then most full size laptops and even some HDTVs!!!The power cord connector seems very loose and the light on the connector has a hard time indicating that it is charging. There is a connector to get the video out to a VGA but you have to use a supplied mini VGA adaptor. There is also a mini HDMI port. There are two USB ports: A 2.0 on the left and a 3.0 on the right.The headphone jack also serves as a microphone input jack. I am not sure how that works for a headset with mic but most headset mic combinations are USB anyway.This Ultrabook comes with the 13.3 inch screen, COREi5, and a 128 GB SSD. I highly recomend the 13.3 inch screen over anything else. The size difference is huge while not adding to the overall size of the actuall computer. Plus the 11 inch screen only has one USB port. I have read that the COREi7 doesn't add that much speed. If you can afford it I would also recommend going with the 256 GB SSD for added storage unless you have a large external drive or cloud service. This is a great computer to travel with and I download my SD card from my camera frequently. There is one SD card slot (not multi card slot). With 128 GB hard drive space photos can eat up that space fast.ASUS provides a very nice slip case for the computer that is well padded with felt and serves to protect the sexy aluminum finish well.I know that next generation models have a lighted keyboard which I wish I had but other than that I recommend this Ultrabook. Plus, it just looks really sexy!::Canyon "'80's Man"::4.0::January 31, 2013
RUMI5C6GURS70::Nice look, but some bugs to work out::I bought the Zenbook about 8 months ago, and thought I'd hold off on doing a review until I'd had a chance to fully get the feel of it.  In retrospect, I wish I had gotten a more conventional laptop.  I absolutely love the look and feel of the Zenbook, but switch to my old Asus netbook, desktop, or my wife's Toshiba if I want to get some work done.  When I use the Zenbook to work on a MS WORD doc, I am constantly re-setting the cursor, which frequently jumps to other places in the document.  This happens with or without an external mouse - and when I am careful to touch only the keys.  I have also noticed that the battery life isn't what I expected.  If you want a nice looking computer to impress your friends in the coffee shop, and plan to use it only for checking e-mail or surfing the web, this one's for you.  If you plan to use it for serious work, you might want to consider something else.::Ugruk::3.0::January 20, 2013

R5J3S5B3GAT5L::Used ASUS G74SX-BBK7::This review is about the product I purchased from KMM5086 - Amazon Marketplace <wnl1n2wrw32kjxg@marketplace.amazon.com>I bought two of these machines from Best Buy last year so I knew what to expect. The seller said it was only being sold as used because it was an open box; otherwise, it hadn't actually been used. For the price, even if it showed some wear, I would have been happy; but when it arrived, it looked exactly the way the other units did when I brought them home from Best Buy last year.Evidently, the seller must have turned it on before shipping it because Windows 7 was updated as of Oct 1, the day it shipped. I thought that was a very nice touch that saved us a lot of time.I bought this unit for my Daughter-in-law to play games like Diablo III on along with my son, who got one of the two identical units last year. After firing it up and getting the two updates recently released by Microsoft; and uninstalling a couple of things, we installed Diablo III and she was playing it when I left.I was a bit leery at first, with him being a new seller on Amazon but the description and price overrode my skepticism and I am very glad that it did. The other thing that worried me a tad was that there was no mention of where it was coming from; but once it shipped, FedEx let me know it was coming from FL. (I think he might mention the location of products he sells in the future.)I also paid for expedited shipping which said I would get the laptop in 4-6 days. It shipped Monday and arrived on Thursday. It doesn't get much better than that!I will be upgrading its memory this weekend, which will give me an opportunity to look inside the case a little bit. I do not anticipate any problems on that score. Again, everything looked brand new and pristine, as advertised.I am complete satisfied with this purchase at this time; and I would buy from this seller again without hesitation.::AWatts::5.0::October 4, 2012

R3J0EQE9LBNST9::Great Purchase::This is a very great laptop for the tasks I put it up to. I use this mostly for word processing and web browsing and am extremely satisfied with this purchase. The processor is great and with 4GB of RAM, this computer is fast. However, be sure to use your own antivirus software and to uninstall the McAfee security software, which slows down the computer immensely. The camera isn't the best but is more than adequate for video conferencing. The addition of the keypad on the right hand side is immensely helpful, especially in Excel spreadsheets. The widescreen is a wonderful addition, and the speakers work well and I am surprised how great of a sound quality they emit. My only gripe is that the touchpad is fairly close to the keyboard, so it is easy to brush it and click out of the text box while typing. In general, this is an amazing laptop and I would highly recommend it for anyone.::T. N.::5.0::February 17, 2012
R3OG70ORFRKBEY::GOOD FOR THE PRICE::Laptop has a good feel to it.  Processor seems to work well.  The most important thing about computers and laptops today when purchasing is to have a minimum of 4 GB or RAM.  This laptop has the 4 GB DDR3 RAM that I require as a minimum.  Works like a champ.  Great Price for anyone looking to do word processing, surf the web, email, facebook, etc.  Not a gaming computer, but worth buying for "normal" use.::Ryan "Fantasy Audiobooker"::5.0::December 16, 2011

R2899058486NNU::Decent Deal for the Price; Runs Hot Though.::The Review:Good specs.  Look for it on sale though.  The case is durable.  You are able to play "THIS-gen" video games like Mass Effect at a decent clip on High or Medium-High settings.The memory speed is quite fast, allowing these older games to utilize the 4 GB ram (128mb) dedicated efficiently enough.It is completely sufficient for any less demanding application.  The WiFi has long range.This is really somewhat of an entry level notebook for home use, however.  I am not crazy about the styling.  The button for on-off is much too big and is easy to press, so I disabled in Control Panel.  I was able to also load Ubuntu release 12.04 Pangolin out of the box with working graphics and wifi.  Wow.  This model is well supported....Acer are not the best at product support, but in the 6 mos since I aquired it there were several driver updates, and one for the Bios.  The onboard motherboard HM55 is fairly budget and precedes the current architecture graphics Sandy Bridge.  This built in graphics are a HD3000 laptop equivalent, slowed down by 1/3 to 800 Mhz motherboard speed.Since I acquired it, I expanded the RAM to the maximum 8GB.  This action is in my opinion superfluous for most basic uses, except for these two factors:o Ram is unbelievably cheapo If you are running a 64 bit system, might as well take advantage of it's abilities.It was as easy as removing 3 screws.  It is not necessary to take off the whole back panel as in previous iterations.The Bad:Despite the good price to performance ratio and passable-to-decent design, the Aspire AS5733Z-4477 has the following problems.1) The keys on the keyboard are designed in such a way, that crumbs, seeds and sundries get stuck in it periodically.  Purhase canned air, or you might be forced to remove and reattach the buttons to clear it out.2) The lcd developed severral small (less than a cm long and 1-2 mm thin) areas of fading within a day of the unboxing.  As there are only 3 of them, they do not bother me really, so I have not attempted an exchange.3) The computer often overheats.  Mind you, I have never had it do this when it is sitting on a desk, but if it's on my lap and there is anything touching either the side or bottom vent, within a minute it will shut down.  This is very frustrating, but if you are used to Acer's low tolerance levels in this area (which have been around for years), you can very much get used to this...::iloveads47::4.0::June 26, 2012
R2HTWI2TZDUJG2::Excellent::I purchased this laptop at Micro Center for about four hundred dollars. Being only thirteen, this was the largest purchase I have made.I bought it for school, and it has surpassed my expectations. A friend of mine has the previous incarnation of this laptop, the Acer Aspire AS5732Z, and is very satisfied. Acer is not exactly regarded as a high quality brand, yet once you try them out, you will as well think otherwise. Five months of being beat up class to class in middle school would certainly take it's toll on something, yet this particular laptop is surprisingly resilient. Five months of constant typing, and the keyboard is still in like new condition. I almost purchased the Acer iconia W500, but decided against it because of its TINY hard drive, and only two gigabytes of ram. With windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit, it is certainly more powerful than, say a Macbook of sorts. I mean not to hate on Apple, but their products are designed to be cool, and what is in style; not functiobnal, and certainly not fast. Back to the Acer, this thing is still going strong, and Christmas is coming soon. For the price, you really cannot get much of a better deal anywhere, on anything else. The dual core processor is fast, and allows for very fast boot up time. I am the only one in my grade that has a Windows platform based laptop (The friend with the previous incarnation is seventh grade). Long after I am ready to type notes, all the other kids are just barely even starting microsoft word. I cannot believe that people will buy a Mac, then expect it to perform quickly. For notes, this thing can save, open and edit in a flash. The keyboard has a standard keyboard, but off to the rigt, there is a number pad, you know with the 789  456  123  0. layoutWhen you want to type quickly, this computer offers very firm keys, that you will know if the input sent or not. I am oh so very satisfied with this machine, and sometimes I catch myself wondering why I had not bought it earlier. This was an upgrade from an Aspire one Netbook, that was a bit sluggish, but did the job nonetheless. I cannot recommend this enough(especially over a macbook).UPDATEIt is the 28th of December 2012, and that darned laptop just won't quit!! As previous reviewers have stated, it does run warm, and the fan is a little loud, but all considered, it was most definitely worth the purchase. I have taken it on many upon many road trips, getting beat up going down the road, and it has performed flawlessly (Although google chrome does give me problems sometimes).I highly recommend this laptop, although, the price it seems to be going for now makes it much less of a good deal. That may, however, and unfortunately, be inflation taking it's toll on things.It is still a great laptop,and I have no regrets buying it over the IConia w500 tablet. You can run High fps games on this laptop, and it barely stutters.UPDATE:it is the 26th of December 2013, and this laptop has started having a few issues. Something has broken loose within the cooling fan, and it now makes an occasional rattling noise. the cooling fan never did work properly, and it overheats and shuts down spontaneously on occasion. I've taken this laptop camping many times, and the back of the screen has gotten too hot to touch because of the campfires, but it just keeps hanging in there. e price that these are going for now makes this laptop not worth it anymore. I have purchased a Lenovo G500S Touch Screen that will be arriving tomorrow, and replacing this Laptop. I've got no regrets about purchasing this, and it's an excellent computer to start out with. This computer will remain the computer that i take camping with me, and on road trips, but my new Lenovo will stay at home. It needs to last a long time.THIS WILL BE THE FINAL UPDATE, as I have gotten a new laptopThanks, A.::Aaron Lawson "Aaron Lawson"::4.0::December 12, 2011
R3SSX8R5GSWX95::good computer if you can bear the noise of the fan::I bought it from MicroCenter. This is a really cheap computer. The speed seems to be good. The biggest problem I have is the noise from its fan which is periodically on-and-off. It makes you wonder when the fan (thus noise) will come back again once it is off.  This can get very annoying.Acer seems to have a problem handling this issue. I worked with an older model several years ago, it had a noisy fan on all the time.::S. Yi::3.0::December 30, 2011

I was in Europe this year with this computer, the name ACER is very well known.You can check with Amazons German website it is mostly 5 stars for Acer labtops! Take advantage of the low price; you do not need the Glossy Container that catch dust and leave finger prints, the impotantance is the lasted technology !::Chanel O.C. CA::5.0::November 13, 2012

R2N53OATGZEXFG::it's great for a cheap laptop::We bought this for our 13 year old daughter for Christmas. The seller was great to work with. The original one was delivered with a broken screen. It looked like fedex dropped it the corner of the box was smooshed in where the screen was broken and of coarse like all shippers coming to our address they leave it on the doorstep and don't even ring the doorbell so we couldn't really dispute the damage. He replaced it and reimbursed us for the return shipping. Works well but she broke an arrow key after about 2 days. Im sure that was her fault. Other than that it works about the same as any other laptop i've used. It doesnt overheat even when she is playing sims and she has it stuffed full of programs already and it hasn't seemed to slow down any.::howes::4.0::March 11, 2012

R131NYWS1QA9MZ::Avoid. (using Linux on this machine)::Too many problems: screen malfunction, charger shorted, and a weak signal from the wireless chip.

R3GF7S23HMVDNB::Fast, impressive, but one major flaw::In a nutshell: the keyboard just sucks. It's horrible, terrible. I can't emphasize enough..if you are normally a fast typist, like I am, then this keyboard will make you mad. It doesn't register keypresses!  WTH!That said, everything else about this little machine is amazing. Screen is beautiful, it's fast, it boots in like 6 seconds! Strangers at the airport (I live at airports) flip when they see this machine.Still, I'm considering returning it. The keyboard on any machine of mine MUST be an extension of my fingers...::ThinkpadGirl::3.0::January 7, 2012
R2MT29Z2063363::Find Laptop Nirvana with the Zenbook::You want a computer that is powerful enough to do real work.  You also want something that has great battery life and is really portable.  Oh yeah, you want it to look nice too.  This machine is terrific and feels rock solid.  It also has nice finishes like matching sleeve and case for the included wired ethernet and VGA video out dongles.Pros- Super fast power-on, wake, and shut-down/sleep -> no waiting around for the machine to be ready to do work- The trackpad is silky smooth and very responsive and right clicking is done by pressind down the bottom right corner of the track pad- Very light but rock solid- Brushed metal looks very sleek and feels greatCons- Two finger scrolling is a bit jerky at times- Takes a bit of practice to learn how to open the clamshell case::B. K. Lower::5.0::November 14, 2011
R20X05GN78PUT::This Laptop Makes Me Happy!::After reading a lot of reviews about the "flawed" keyboard and trackpad on this laptop, I was hesitant to buy it.I'm a college student; I was looking for something super-portable to take to grad school, but more powerful than a netbook so I could process data.  I admit, I went for the zenbook because, let's face it, it's just so darn cute!After three months, I'm thrilled with this laptop.The trackpad works fine.  I disabled zoom functions because I kept accidentally zooming, but left on two- and three-finger scrolling, which work fine.The touchpad will occasionally throw a temper tantrum and start behaving erratically.  This happens about once a month, and all it takes to fix is a reboot, which takes about fifteen seconds.  It usually happens after I have been using the computer for about a week without a real shut-down(and continuously postponing my update installs).The keyboard is also fine once you get used to it.It only took me a couple hours to stop missing keys; you do have to press them with a little more conviction than you do on other laptops, but it doesn't take long to learn.That said, I'm a petite lady with tiny hands; I find the keyboard comfortable.  If you've got bigger hands you might have more trouble.I like the screen size, too, but my roommates complain that it is too small to watch a movie in a group.  Solution: watch the movie on my roommate's laptop.  Problem solved.It is tiny but not fragile.  The case that comes with it is attractive and means I don't worry about shoving it in my backpack and running off to class.  I also love being able to pick it up with one hand and no effort.The internet connectivity is great (some other reviews had mentioned bad wireless cards.  Mine works perfectly.)Yes, the power button is on the keyboard where the delete key should be.  I've never hit it accidentally, but if I did, it would take about five seconds for me to wake the computer back up, so what's the problem?To sum up:Size and portability are awesome.No trouble with internet.Trackpad and keyboard are fine once you get used to them.This laptop makes me happy every time I use it.  Even when I am using it to do my Physical Chemistry homework.  I am thrilled and recommend it to everyone with no reservations.  I hope you love it, too.::Melissa::5.0::March 30, 2012
R3EX7D5MP7CK1T::Beware the proprietary hard drive format!  Can't be replaced if it fails...  But Amazon RULES::UPDATE:  Amazon stepped up to the plate and took the product back with a full refund.  They were under NO obligation to do so under the terms of purchase and I had originally contacted them just asking for help getting a response from ASUS.  No back and forth.  Just a very polit e-mail with a return shipping label.  This was well and above what was hoping for.  So two takeaways 1).  DON'T buy a notebook with proprietary parts - especially from ASUS.  2).  DO buy from Amazon.  Great end to what had been looking like a bad story.------SSD hard drive failed after only a month or two of use (see description below).  I start to look into replacing it and discover that the UX21 has a totally proprietary drive size/shape/format and you CANNOT BUY A REPLACEMENT DRIVE AT RETAIL.  So if you decide to buy one of these, you are totally at the mercy of ASUS if your hard drive goes bad (as SSD drives often do).That would also be OK if ASUS was willing to replace it themselves, sell you a replacement drive, or even answer their e-mail.  I have been waiting for two weeks now and can't get a peep out of Asus (the only communication from them so far is a "customer service survey" which is ironic given I have received no service so far).The customer service problems and the early drive failure might just be my bad luck, but I would have NEVER bought this machine if I had known that I could not swap out a part as prone to failure as a SSD hard drive.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this sort of risk.PROBLEM:  The hard drive on this machine is failing.  Getting "blue screen of death" in Windows. I also run Ubuntu Linux and getting intermittent shut-downs with "I/O error at sector XXXX" reported as the system fails. Most recently the PC has started to boot up into the BIOS screen and not recognized the internal hard drive as a boot option. My best guess is the SSD drive has failed (after only a month or two of use).::WSK "Semper Ubi SubUbi"::1.0::September 23, 2012
R3BMN1KHVAB08T::Love the Laptop.  Only lost a star because of mouse pad::I really love this laptop.  I first purchased the 13 inch version.  I loved it so much that I bought a second one (11") for my wife.  both of them are super fast.  Resume time is always 2 seconds so it makes it awesome for travel and quick starts.  Restart is only 20 seconds.  Killer travel machine.  Plan on getting a bluetooth mouse.  The mouse isnt the best.  I use it but it should loose a star or 1/2 star for the mouse.  Love them both. I got 25% off retail price during the 2011 holidays.  Makes it a no brainer.::Anthony C. D. "Tony D."::4.0::December 30, 2011
R1UITBQLRKMTEC::Great Product::Ok, so honestly i have been in the market for a super fast yet portable and light tablet or a laptop for the past year. I started off with an IPad and returned it, bought an Acer Iconia Tablet, and found no use for it, and then tried the Samsung Galaxy Tab that i thought was worth keepng for 2 months and ended selling it.  Ultimately giving up on tablets, i decided to look into the new ultra light notebooks with SSD and Windows 7.  Spent 5 days doing research and ultimately decided to buy the Asus Zenbook UX21.  And guys i have to say from the monent i opened this puppy to literally wiriting this review i am enjoying this laptop more than any of the tablets i tried in the psat.  I read many negative reviews about the multi-touch funtionality for scrolling up and down and quite honestly i think its pretty decent after the update.  Also what i found is if it tries to zoom in and out jot down the Ctrl+0 combo as that will bring your screen back to the 100% view to fit your screen.  This sweet looking baby comes at a premium but i think i have found what i am looking for and this will suffice the purpose.  I think i am set for a while!  I highly recommend this product for people tht are looking to surf, type, listen to music, and watch movies!  It works like a charm havent experienced any major lags.  It took a while to completely update the hardware and software, but its well worth it.  It's better to have frequent updates than waiting for months and months like the tablet market space.My lenghty 2 cents!::Techenthusiast::4.0::December 25, 2011
R2RZSU9AJDLW4S::Not bad for one of the first Ultrabooks.::I bought this computer because I needed something a little more powerful than a netbook. It's easy to say that the ux21 is a Macbook Air(MBA) clone... but keep in mind that Asus basically invented the netbook market(which the MBA is arguably trying to fit in to) and also the "seashell" design. I believe the i5 version of the ux21 has very similar specs as the low end 11 inch MBA but at a slightly cheaper price tag. Keep in mind that Intel is coming out with new processors around mid 2012 which should be faster, use less power, and also less expensive so expect faster "ultrabooks" next year with better battery life and better price tags.I really love this computer but I have few qualms...Most important is the short battery life. The battery lasts around 4-5 hours, which I've heard is comparable to the MBA but I've personally used the 2nd generation MBA and I found it's battery life to be closer to 5-6 hours. BUT, on the other hand the ux21 has a feature Asus calls "Instant On" which allows the computer to restart in about 12 seconds and return from sleep in under 2 seconds(both times are better than any Macbook I've used). If you are not constantly using the computer and you set it to sleep after a few minutes this will save a lot of battery life.The glass trackpad is really nice and almost identical to the MBA(the entire trackpad acts as one large button that you can click anywhere, but it still has a designated left and right mouse click at the bottom of the pad) but it doesn't seem very accurate. I tried playing with different speeds of the mouse but it just doesn't feel right. It's kind of hard to describe but it's definitely the only real bad thing I can think of besides the battery life. Hopefully this can be fixed with a driver update.Pros:-cheaper than a MBA-build quality-all aluminum(except keys)-nice trackpad-runs Windows-extremely fast startup/wakeup time-two finger scroll with non-customizable gesturesCons:-battery life-get's pretty hot/loud while playing 3D intensive games  -Team Fortress 2 runs fine but VERY hot/loud  -Minecraft runs very choppy... which stinks because it's fine on the 2nd generation MBA-trackpad responsiveness is a little weird-it's easy to miss certain keys while typing-still a hefty price for a laptop-a little too similar to the MBA in design::jeremetron::4.0::November 12, 2011
R2QBGY3A8NF4OA::perfect mba alternative for win::Coming from a July 2011 MBA, I purchased this UX21 as a replacement and have no regrets. The other "ultrabook" choices are ugly or not as good. Toshiba Z830 is the only other one i'd consider in the US mkt atm. There are newer models in Asia that I haven't looked into yet.If I were to buy a laptop over again, I'd consider the 1.8ghz ver. This PC is bottlenecked only by CPU and GPU. I was able to run PS CS5 fine on a project with 8 layers but it had some occasional display inconsistencies.First, I have not experienced any of that audio jack problem some people claim. This PC is works just as you'd expect any new purchase to work.Pros vs MBA:1. much better hardware spec than MBA. The SATA III SSD rocks MBA's at a base level. Win 7 is clearly heavier. If they both ran OSX, this build would be faster. 128GB HD is a definite plus even with the default OS taking up a lot of space. 64GB runs out really fast. navigating the OS, I found the UX21 to be snappier. It's more Win 7 animation, slow fx, and more process loading that make it seem slower at times, such as during boot. you could always load a new OSaudio was nice. need headphones to really tell the quality difference.ppl seeing the UX21 for the first time found it very sleek and stylish. doesn't loose to mba at all in its own way. i like the spun metallic look.2. lid & display do not smudge nearly as often as MBA. i like things clean and MBA almost always needs to be wiped constantly cuz even closing the lid, smudges from the keys to the lcd appear so you have to wipe both.3. compatibility is a big plus. Some network printers output garbage when printing with the MBA. different disk format is not really effective for cross-OS file transfers. dealbreaker though was the WiFi. So many troubles with picking up networks and logging in. Finally, I found that Lion doesn't accept WEP networks for certain applications. It will only read WPA networks. The lack of a decent OS restore method killed the MBA for me. If you have other Apple product, you might have enough to put together a bootable USB, but this is my first MBA. There's no OS disk! I was downloading the OS via Internet Recovery but after it failed the first time following a couple hrs, I was not doing it again. I'm traveling often so I can't change network encryption or sit there waiting for an OS recovery. This led to me returning the MBA.Cons:1. The touchpad...sucks. It's decent as in it works. But on a scale of 1 to 5 vs MBA touchpad, this is a 1. Enabling drag locking makes it usable if you're used to do 2-finger drag actions. Otherwise it will read it as a rapid cursor relocation.2. The keyboard has no backlighting!! o.o I didn't find any problems typing though. Of course, you can't type as quickly since these are more stiff, but you can't really type that fast on such low profile keys anyway.3. MBA's power adapter is actually a lot better. At first glance, it just appears to be a fancier look, magnetic strip for plugging in, but if someone trips on the wire, the MBA cord tends to fly away, preventing drops. This is my biggest problem with the UX21 right now next to the touchpad. Both need to be improved ASAP.4. the UX21 lid is a lot tougher to open with one hand. the positive aspect of the stiff hinge is that the display will probably never flop in the next X yrs. I've gotten used to it but the inset groove from MBA is clearly a better design that the protrusion lip of the UX21.5. might be my imagination or windows chrome problem, but chrome flash plug in crashes a lot more than mba. i'm considering a clean reinstall or switch to linux to compare performance change after i store a backup::LV::4.0::November 23, 2011
R1BAPMME6JX5XX::Fatally Flawed::I had high hopes for this machine. It is truly a beautiful work of art. Very stylish, seems to just ooze quality ... but... unfortunately the WiFi is terrible. I tried everything to get he WiFi working acceptably, but never could get it reliable. If I were rating WiFi alone, I would give it one star. The other big problem is the keyboard. It must be struck exceptionally hard or the character won't register. I thought I would adapt to this, but after a week and lots of typing it continued to be a problem. In the end I reluctantly returned it. I wanted so badly to keep it but the WiFi and keyboard issues were constant and serious irritants. Dang!::kenryan::3.0::April 14, 2012
R27U6AKAIT0517::Great computer::This is a wonderful used computer.  It is extremely fast.  It has a pleantitude of outlets, USB, VGA, HDMI, SD card, mic, ear, etc. I personally appreciate the incredible processor and the RAM which make it an incredibly fast, versatile laptop.  One of the fun features is the lighted keyboard which turns off after about 20 seconds of nonuse.  As I tend to use my laptop in the evenings this has already been appreciated.  The keyboard itself will take a little getting used to, things on the right are not where they were on my last laptop but the keys themselves are very responsive and tight.  My last laptop was prone to "ghost" typing, if you rested your hand anywhere on the wrist rest area it would read as a typing stoke or a mouse movement and I would get some unusual results.  This laptop appears much more sturdily constructed.I cannot say enough good about the seller.  The computer arrived with Windows Vista on it, an operating system I hate with a passion and spent many years cursing as I was forced to use it at work.  Also, the computer was advertised as having Windows 7 on it.  I contacted the seller, sent the computer back and received the reloaded computer with Windows 7 Ultimate on it.  Since it was freshly loaded, I have spent the last two days loading updates on it, but that just tells me it was a new, clean load.  The response time from the seller (who lives on the opposite side of the United States) was remarkable fast, especially as we had a major holiday in the middle of the mailing back and forth.I foresee this being my main computer for the next five years, at least.::MGW "Desert Rat"::5.0::December 9, 2013

R8KOM2EZRBS5::Bad hardware, Bad customer service::I received this laptop in what appeared to be good condition. The only problem is the screen won't turn on half the time so the thing is totally useless. The seller recommended a software upgrade but that didn't work. I took it to a technician and they say its a hardware problem.The seller is demanding 20% restocking fee plus I pay shipping... That's $90 with nothing to show for it.

R2S0HEQEKS5W6L::Great price, prompt shipping, good communication.::I do my comfort / real computing on my Mac with OSX: I keep that upddated with the latest SW and apps.But I got tired of running into so many cool gadgets that will not work completely with my beloved Macbook Pro 17" mid 2010.Instead of contaminating my sweet MBP with a Windows installation, I decided to get a sturdy Windows laptop for use with dash-cams, home security cams, blood pressure meters, gamma spectrometers, etc. that work best in Windows.I never thought I could afford a Toughbook, but I stuck a crowbar in my wallet and got this one; amazing bargain!I fear the Window.I decided that XP Pro 32-BIT was the most practical system for the gadgets mentioned above; a limited use, but fun, I hope.CAUTION:Mine came with Windows 7 Pro, without a product key. But I hacked that key out of hiding anyway.At first this seemed great.Soon, however, I learned that Windows 7 Pro IS NOT FULLY SUPPORTED IN THIS MODEL TOUGHBOOK(CF-30CPAZBM  Mark 1).I found I could not lower the display, from eye-searing blaze to comfortable levels using the keyboard nor any control panel in the OS.The speaker volume likewise, except that there is a convenient enough slider, on screen, to adjust this. I don't know how many other functionalities are broken in Windows 7 Professional 32-bit, when used with this model Toughbook.I have had to buy a correct Recovery Disk direct from Panasonic for $35 and it came without a key. I hope the Product Key and Proof Of License numbers on the sturdy OEM sticker on the bottom of this Toughbook are still good, as they look like OEM stickers.The disk arrived today.THIS CORRECT Windows OS to get is the one that came installed, from the factory, by Panasonic (Matsushita) at original purchase.It is WINDOWS XP Professional PANASONIC 32-BIT.I am having to hurry with my setting up of this beauty, because MICROSOFT IS KILLING ALL SUPPORT OF WINDOWS XP THIS APRIL.------------------------------------------WONDERFUL STUFF:* If anyone tries to rob me of this machine, I can slap them silly with it and walk away calmly. It will look and run great - no problem.* It all unscrews apart and spare parts can be had from Panasonic, if you want to trick it out as far as possible - like I do  :)I will upgrade the HDD, from 80GB to 500 GB.I will upgrade the CDR/DVD drive to full CDR/DVDR as well.I will open the LCD display to see about the rainbow, drip stain that comes down to about an inch below the top of the screen.I will install a GPS kit with cool Martian antenna in the upper left corner of the lid.I will have a set of OEM plastic, lid-edge bumper trim for future replacement, in case of scuffs or scratches.I will replace the full-travel, no light keyboard with an OEM, back-lit, chiclet keyboard.I will not go higher than 500 GB on the HDD, nor faster than 56k rpm, because fast, multi-platter HDD's may generate too much heat for this model TB to handle: it has no fans and relies instead on heat-pipe technology. I would not upgrade the CPU either for the same thermal considerations. __________________* The machine was in much better condition than I expected, except for a minor, cosmetic drip stain at the top edge  of the display.* The Battery was in 100% charge condition and appears brand new.* There are so many ports of so many types that my eyes dazzle!  Of course, the monitor port selection does not  include CDMI since this is an old model Toughbook.* All ports and entrances to the machine are covered by locking or clicking flaps to seal in the goodness.* There were no noticeable dings or scratches.* The PWR+ AC Adapter/Charger was not OEM and it can get very warm, but it seems to be OK: I set it on its side to stay cooler.* The speaker single speaker is loud enough and produces  very clear sounds.---------------------------All-in-all, as much as I fear the Windows, I will have fun with this machine.--gd::gooddog::5.0::January 31, 2014
R3KNQ0XMEK6MWG::Wireless problems made it useless-Asus support gave up::Works beautifully if plugged into the wall.  On battery it disconnects every ten minutes or the second i plug in my iphone.  All the known power saving settings problems are addressed: setup F2 to latest defaults, latest wireless adapter configured so it does not let windows disconnect for power saving, windows 7 up to date.  Case 1778026 if other Asus techs are reading this.  The last Asus tech I got assigned to (I talked to three because they will not wait five minutes to see if their solution works) , who in all fairness did wait at my request, after seeing that her last attempt did not work, said that they could not do anything else about it.  When I said that there is no option for me but to return it then, she agreed, apologizing.  Replacement was not suggested, which leads me to believe that this is a known problem for which they do not have a fix yet.  I have two new $400 HP pavilions notebooks with same power working beautifully on my home network, with windows 7, albeit a bit uglier looking.  That tells you that it's nice for a notebook to be beautiful with all solid hardware, but does not do you any good if it cannot perform a basic function, in this case connect to wireless, consistently in the marketplace.  I'm glad I bought it thru Amazon, their return process is flawless.::Monica::1.0::April 6, 2012
R1XJWAR3TTOOP8::Excellent Laptop::The ASUS Zenbook has performed as advertised. The response times are fast.  The system boot-up time is within seconds. My frame of reference was a Lenovo T61 running Windows XP which had a boot time of nearly 5 minutes.I have experienced no issues with the keyboard.  The feel is different than traditional laptops since the "travel" distance is very shallow. But I required little time to adjust to the feel.  I also experienced no problems with the touch pad.  It seems that the prior issues must have been corrected.Overall a very light, stylish piece of hardware.::Buckeye Mark::5.0::January 31, 2012

RQY3ODOIDFE9Y::Fantastic Laptop::I've had the laptop for 10 days and I love it. I can't believe how light it is and how fast it comes out of standby. I'm an application develop and bought this as my personal laptop, but I have loaded it up with CS 5.5 Web Premium, Visual Studio 2010 and SQL Server 2008. It handles them all with out a problem and still comes out of standby in 2 seconds. I have not had any problem with the keyboard or mouse. The high resolution display and sound are incredible for such a thin laptop.I do wish it had more ram and wireless N, Overall I am thrilled with this laptop and my friends are jealous.::Dan S::5.0::December 2, 2011
R16AH47YBEOI0W::Deceptively Beautiful::On first look, the Zenbook is a gorgeous, sexy machine.  It is evident from the packaging alone, which resembles origami, that ASUS is striving to be the Apple of Wintel.  But they have a ways to go.  From the engraved model description at the top of the keyboard (in a typefont terribly mismatched to the "ASUS" logo immediately above) to the chinglish documentation to the fascinatingly cheesy entertainment portal, ASUS Vibe, the Zenbook does not bear close scrutiny.  Yet I still wanted to like the Zenbook... until the click started.  After warming up for the thirty minutes, a repeating two "click" noise would begin, roughly beneath the escape key.  The "click" was subtle, but spaced far apart enough and quiet enough to never become white noise.  Then, the wireless network connection began to fail, requiring reboots.  Soon after the internet connection failed even when successfully connected to the wireless network.  On and on it went.  Thank god for Amazon's return policies.I hope that ASUS pulls it together.  The design is clever, if in need of polishing, and there are some truly impressive achievements such as the speaker sound quality.  I have never heard a laptop produce such true, resonant sound.  It is a marvel.  But in its current state, the UX31 is a major disappointment.::Hamid Thomson::2.0::November 4, 2011
R1EF96ATFJRYT8::Unstable Wireless and Irritating Touchpad::I've had this computer for about a year now. I was excited because it was priced really well and looks a lot like the MacBook Air.I should have paid the extra $400 for a MacBook Air (or gone with another Windows laptop). There are two major issues that make this computer a straight up pain.1. The touchpad is really weird and sensitive. It often jumps over the page; I can't count the number of times I tried to cut and paste and ended up cutting the wrong thing.2. The wireless connection is awful. It disconnects really frequently (in the past hour, it has disconnected me nine times, while no one else in my vicinity has had that problem) and it runs slowly. I have since searched for that issue and it seems like it is widespread - people blame it either on the quality of the wireless card or the solid aluminum body. For me, a good internet connection is crucial to basic functionality, so this does not deliver.Bottom Line: If I could go back in time, I would not buy this laptop.::Klara::2.0::March 26, 2014
R17HII7MHXOUV0::Caution!! 128 GB hard drive instead of 256!::Be careful! The description says it has 256BG hard drive (in 3 different places), but it's actually came 128! They cheated on me! It's really terrible, as hdd size was the reason I've chosen this one. The laptop is OK, but with such a hard drive size it's merely useless.::Anna::2.0::October 7, 2013

R1UWIDS6LTP9NJ::I'm in PAIN!::Zenbook, why have you forsaken me? You are beautiful, sleek, uber-portable, fast, but you suck, Grasshopper.1. I had to send the first one back within 2 weeks because the screen went black. The problem is the screen is wobbly/loose where it attaches to the keyboard. The second one came with the same issue, so I have been babying it so it won't die on me, too. It kind of makes the whole portability thing moot if it wobbles all over kingdom come when moving it from one spot to another.2. The keyboard takes tremendous effort to register a keystroke. It happens all over the keyboard, but is the worst with the right hand, particularly the first two fingers. This cuts into productivity because it requires one correction after another, is a worse PAIN when typing passwords, and this gets old really REALLY fast.3. Touchpad -- yeah. Good thing I prefer a mouse. Updating the driver didn't help, though some have had luck with it.4. Wifi, you hope. It drops off my home network often, and I have to reset the modem before the Zenbook will recognize it again. None of the other laptops in the house have this issue except... oh, wait... another Asus laptop flaked out this same way. Asus? Knock knock! Are you home? People don't like this, and updating the driver more than once DID NOT HELP.As I write this, Zenbook Numero Dos has been Fedexed back for repairs. This is a total pain in the patoot, since all data has to be transferred, programs uninstalled, blah blah blah. Seriously, nobody has this much time to spend on wonky computer issues. I told Asus not to send it back to me if they couldn't eliminate all these problems. I'll keep you posted.::Everyday Kay::2.0::May 14, 2013
R3BUDJ657WDOLZ::Great for the price!::I wrote the below when I first got the laptop, however the machine has now crashed which is not very pleasing.=======================================I was looking for a bargain computer for my 8 yr old.  She wanted something with a bigger screen. Luckily I found this.  She's had it a few months now and so far, its working out perfectly and I have had no problems with it.  The graphics quality and sound are great as she mostly uses it to watch Netflix.  I have no complaints about this computer for what I needed it for.  I cant comment on multitasking or using applications because it is mostly used to surf the net and stream. In terms of the exterior, well, its not top quality but luckily, nothing has broken as yet.  Must be good enough if my 8 yr old hasnt ripped through it by now because she's very fiddly.::iSland giRl "Island Girl"::1.0::January 4, 2012

R1KBHLVJAAALYD::Great laptop for general use::I bought this laptop to replace my old Dell and I love it! It boots in around 20-30 seconds and is really fast in High Performance mode. It can even run Starcraft 2 with no problems. For the people that say it's slow, have you looked to see what mode it's in? It has 4 operating modes. High Performance, Entertainment, Quiet Office, and Battery Saver mode. It comes with Battery Saver mode on default so make sure to change it. If your looking for a really good laptop for a fair price then this is the one to get.Update:I have now had this laptop for almost three years and it is still holding up very well. By now the hardware is slightly outdated, but it still performs exceptionally. Over time the laptop has slowed down a little bit, but I have counteracted by upgrading the RAM prebuilt into the laptop. I still use it for mid-level computer games and for other day to day uses which it is very well suited to do. If you take of this laptop it will perform great for a long period of time and makes a great cheap device.I only docked a star from it's rating because of the slow down over time and because the laptop is actually an ASUS K53U and not an A53U. I have no idea why Amazon has it listed as an A53U as you can find no details on the ASUS site about an A53U. Otherwise this is a great laptop!::agileconnor::4.0::January 14, 2012
RKNXSNGSIZPW2::Good Replacement Computer for the money::This review is not going to be extremely in-depth, because I bought this computer for my dad for Christmas and only used it for about 2 days to get everything set up on it. Side note: My personal computers are Macs, but I am not extremely biased on operating systems, and I think Windows did a good job with 7. That being said, here is my initial impression on the computer.The shipment of the laptop was quick and free (thanks Amazon Prime)! Packaging was minimum, but definitely secured and padded the laptop, which is a bonus in my eyes.Upon opening the packaging, the computer looked sleek. It seemed like it was made not as study as a MacBook Pro (my Mac side showing), but it also wasn't cheaply made. It's made with plastic, which allows for it to be lighter and hopefully more durable.Windows 7 Home Premium came with it, which is a nice upgrade from the basic, but it came loaded with all the Asus add-ons and slowed down the performance greatly. On start-up, the computer was using about ~65-70% of the memory performance. There was A LOT of programs running that was bogging down the performance. The very first thing I did was install a fresh copy of Windows 7 Home Premium and wiped the hard drive of all the nasty programs. The Windows 7 disc didn't come with the computer, so it may help to have a friend that has a physical disc and you can just load your OEM Windows key that came with the computer (on the box).Once a fresh Windows 7 was installed, the computer ran like a dream. It is mainly being used for web surfing and light office work. I haven't received a call with any problems with it, so it's holding up!If you are looking for a high-performing laptop for gaming or other CPU-intensive tasks, this obviously isn't the best choice computer for you. But for daily web browsing, word processing and less demanding CPU/GPU tasks, I recommend this laptop!I highly recommend installing a fresh Windows 7 as soon as you pull it out of the box, and of course use protection! Windows has free software that works great for personal computers. You can't go wrong.::khaos::4.0::February 2, 2012
R1IXUPZOFQTO7H::Excellent Laptop!::We purchased this to replace a Gateway laptop and I have to say so far this ASUS is an excellent little computer! Very easy to get this up and running and it loads pages quickly. The warranty that comes with the laptop is one of the best that I've seen. For the money you can't go wrong with this!::Pat::5.0::December 15, 2011
R2CEYHVW53W00H::Suitable for the kids needs::Computer works fine.  Less bloatware than an HP or Dell, but still required some removal at first set up.  If you're trying to play Skyrim, this is not your machine.  If you're going to email, skype, play angry birds and eventually do school work... this is fine.::P. C. WALL "PCW"::4.0::January 16, 2012
R2Y7XWW9H4U8W5::Simple and Just Enough for Travel::This was my Christmas present to myself.  I am using it to replace my much more robust HP Pavilion 17 inch laptop, which is not that portable.  The HP works great as a home computer, but is heavy and cumbersome for travel.  This new ASUS is just right for travel.  It is light weight, and the screen is big enough to work remotely.  It works great as an extra computer (as I also have a desktop.)  It is the perfect device that is in between my Xoom Tablet and My HP Desktop.  I would not recommend it for someone who depends on a computer solely for their lively hood, but it you need a great computer for email, internet surfing, and smaller job task, this is perfect.::Pamela "I love technology, reading, music, an...::5.0::January 9, 2012
RBZZM6BVUDD9G::The Bestest!::This is my first first-hand notebook acquisition.  Hereunder are my comments:1.  Appearance.  Very stylish.  I like it very much to the point of wiping it every so often with a little Florida water.2.  Performance:  Very fast processing of data.  Uploading documents is a breeze.  Windows 7 is just right, and updated to the minute.  There is no clutter; everything is very well organized.3.  Software.  The built-in softwares are good.  But I had to deactivate the games bundle as I am not into it.Overall, FIVE STARS for me.  Thank you, ASUS!  You have given me faith in the P.C.::Benito B. Maray "Oooommmm"::5.0::November 26, 2011
R31ST3SOYHIWFT::This was a very good buy.::I bought this (ASUS A53U-EH11) laptop from Amazon.com because I needed another laptop to carry with me when I went on a trip.My other ASUS has been a very good product and is still in very good condition, but it has programs that I would not need on vacation, also it has plugins that makes it harded to make portable.I am very satisfied with this product, and I got it at a very low price.  Thank you Amazon, Pops::pops::5.0::February 23, 2012
RNBEEQ598U4H3::Clean reinstall for better performance::I spent a day clean reinstalling this model for a Christmas gift for a 12 year old, after trying to clean up the preinstalled factory bloatware resulted in hangs and explorer crashing.  As always it runs instantaneously after a clean reinstall, but users should be aware that the cam software package will not work when installed from Asus Downloads webpage for this model.  This means you can't look at yourself with various controls to tweak appearance.  However the cam still works with the Win7 driver given for real-life needs like Skype or Video chat that rely on those 3rd party programs.Use free MS Security Essentials AV for best performance, with all startups except AV turned off in msconfig>Startup and >Services after hiding all MS services.Clean reinstall requires the quick robocall activation necessary when the COA sticker containing Product Key has OA (offline activation) after the version name. You can google the official Win7 ISO download to burn to DVD.Other than using the drivers which Win7 delivers in installer and are updated quickly via optional Windows Updates, I did also import the model's chipset which often adds functionality on laptops.  I noticed no additional performance gain.  The laptop has  instantaneous and feather-light performance which is what one should expect with Win7, after conquering the factory bloatware which throttles and corrupts the best OS ever.gregrocker, Guru at SevenForums, top Windows 7 forum on the web.

R2J6LK9EWPEZ3Y::Awesome!::As a casual computer user, I think that this is a great laptop!I purchased my old laptop (also an Asus) from Best Buy for about $850, and I think that this one is just as great as that one was.The appearance is nice - it is sleek and a blackish color, not dark brown like I'd expected (phew). The touch pad is great. I can pinch and spread my fingers to zoom in and out, and the area around the touch pad has some sort of cooling system, which is pretty neat too. When in power saving mode, the battery lasts for quite a long time.Many people on here gripe about slow internet performance, but this laptop works just as well online as my sister's Macbook Pro does. I really think that it just depends on how good your internet connection is.This laptop comes with a starter version of Microsoft Word and Excel. If only it came with PowerPoint...looks like I'll have to buy that separately. Still, I was impressed that it came with an actual version of Microsoft Word instead of Microsoft Works like my other Asus laptop had.The price is unbeatable, especially with the included warranty. I read through it, and it looks like pretty much everything other than theft and weather disasters are covered. I would highly recommend this laptop to any casual computer user - it is such a good little laptop for such a good little price!::Alina::5.0::July 16, 2012
R3UMHRT8BP1Q2H::asus A53U good laptop::bought 2 of these last week. First thing i noticed when box was opened was the shiny mocha color which was very attractive. booted up and graphics was great. Performance after installing some programs was very fast. One problem was that the speakers were very soft for altec lansing. Tried everything to get them to boosts even went into the bios but it was locked on setting "4". So headphones or external speakers required for good listening. Pc is very good for the price and gonna purchase another one soon.::Sean Ali::4.0::May 23, 2012
R1WUSHTCLWFLSG::asus mocha A53u::the product is very good fast laptop with good screen resolution processing power surprises me but has a lower processor.the only drawback that tube with the paper are the speakers have a low sound which I find odd since they are brand altec and always have a loud sound in their products in order to recommend the article.::jose luis::5.0::March 29, 2012
R333BRMDONYXHW::Great little laptop::Our desktop died.  It was a sad, sad day.  Well, it didn't really DIE, but it is on it's last computer chip.  The poor thing will become a "kid's computer".  That should really put it out of it's misery.  So the search began for another computer.  We decided to get a laptop so we could have something portable.  The search went on for about a month or so, reading reviews and comparing strengths and weaknesses.  This was the winner.  It is a small, yet quick and powerful computer.  Does everything I need it to do and haven't had any problems out of it.  If only it had a port for coffee....  Yeah, I give it 5 stars.::Bobby S.::5.0::May 6, 2012

R1CQAX6P24CSY3::Sorry I bought this.::This is the first bad computer I have ever bought. The touch board is almost worthless.This is the first time I wished to have my old mouse back. My thought on buying this was that for 349.00 and no extension warranties or sales tax, when it screwed up I could just throw it in the garbage and buy another one.Unfortunately I think I am just going to throw this thing in the garbage and go back to an HP computer which was 10 times the machine for a hundred dollars more.Why on earth would anyone make a touchboard that works like this one does? For some reason it takes forever to load and is inferior in every respect.Now I have had about a week with this thing I want to expand my review. I found the high performance setting on this and tried it out. It just gets me to the wrong page quicker. The touch board is so sensitive that your finger doesn't have to be on it to change the page. The scroll works when it wants and I have to use the arrow buttons to get anywhere. If this is high performance than they should have  never offered any other setting for it.The worst part is I bought this for a backup computer almost 6 months ago and just took it out of the box now. If I return it, it will be pro rated and I would have to pay for shipping. I will buy a HP and throw this travesty in the dumpster. I do not blame amazon for this, but I will never buy another item from asus.Every computer that I have ever bought has been an improvement on the one before. This one is on par with my first Gateway which was so obsolete that it was given to me.Do not let the price beguile you. This machine is junk pure and simple.::cementmason::1.0::November 25, 2012
R3AHDDX0N5PJ0X::Don't expect too much.::I was excited to purchase this laptop since I was upgrading from an older, Windows XP Gateway.  I held off writing this review for several weeks, hoping that my experience would improve but it has not.While it is a functional computer, this is one of the slowest laptops I have ever owned.  It has several power settings, including one called "High Performance" but it is more realistically a "Slightly Below Average Performance."  I first noticed the speed in how long it took to boot up and shut down.  Later, when I would install a program, I would have to wait at least a minute before the InstallShield program would even begin.  I'm not sure what goes on for a minute between clicking Install and the Install Program beginning, but I've never had a computer that was this slow.A couple other annoyances:1.  The DVD drive sounds like an airplane is taking off when it's initially reading a disc - I let a friend use the laptop once to watch a DVD and he hollered at me in a semi-panic because of the noise of the DVD drive.2.  The computer seems to adjust the power settings on its own.  I may have clicked on High Performance but the computer will just change into Battery Saver mode seemingly at random, which dims the screen and slows the programs.  So I have to then minimize whatever I'm working on and put the power back on High Performance.  It's not the end of the world but it's annoying.I wish I could return the computer for a different one, however, I bought it before going to live outside of the country so now I feel stuck.  For my first ASUS purchse, I feel a bit grifted.::canaanx::2.0::September 1, 2012

RWKT8LW50A0TY::Good overall, LCD screen & speakers NOT so great::Received this laptop about 2 weeks ago as a gift for someone.  I setup the laptop for her.  It's a good laptop overall.  It has a DVD burner and an HDMI port, which is great for viewing stuff on an HDTV.  Some reviewers have written that the computer is slow and unsuitable for web surfing.  That seemed like a bogus claim given the 3 gigs of RAM and the dual core processor.  In fact, the computer performs very well.  Webpages, including YouTube, load quickly and smoothly.  Of note, I had immediately set the computer to high performance.  Perhaps the people who gave this computer a bad review did not have it set to high performance.  Physically, the computer seemed sturdy and well constructed.What I didn't like so much about the computer were the viewing angles on the LCD screen and the speakers.  If a person looks at the LCD screen from an angle, the screen does not look as good.  The speakers are not at all powerful.  A user would probably need to purchase a speaker system to enjoy music or videos.For the price, this is overall a very good system.  4 stars....::Athlonnx::4.0::June 26, 2012
R2DAKKRI7SEYV5::Peice of Junk::This computer has not worked properly since I received it only a month ago.

Do not buy this. It is shit.::Space.Folklorist::1.0::August 2, 2012
R2LCG5FP8KXAKC::Really Slow - Underpowered::Bought this as it was advertised as a versatile entertainment laptop, however the thing could not even stream Nextflix. I stripped all the bloatware of it (which was not much to be fair), and even suspended all non essential services when trying to get Netflix streaming, but it was just not able to handle the video compression, ran the cpu up to 100%, and then playback just stuttered. It's a nice little laptop, but very underpowered, unless all you want to do is surf, do't bother, this will not handle basic web games or video streaming.::Nick::1.0::July 4, 2012

A computer with a clock speed of 1.00 GHz is too slow.The problem was not in the power saving settings, I tried them all.Review update: It was probable bad luck on getting a unit that did not work, never had that problem with ASUS before.Return to Amazon went very well.Ordered another ASUS laptop from Amazon and it works as expected.

I know it is not my internet since my other computer is a high end gaming computer and it runs smooth and fast on wifi.  Also the first thing I did was try to burn my back up DVD's and the disk tray cover came right off and keeps coming off.  My other laptop is an Asus G73S and has none of these quality issues but that one cost a lot more.  This one feels like Chinese crap.

R12F5RTDZHT1SJ::Poor Quality, No Power, Not Enough RAM...::With only 2 GB RAM this laptop is extremely slow. With all the included apps installed by ACER and the proprietary restore/recover features (translate: issues.) it is full of quirks. About all it is really good for is email, writing, and lightweight tasks. I do not recommend installing MS Office or any of the apps, they are just far too slow.Other issues include a very cheap keyboard in that the keys wear out very quickly, in turn, making it very difficult to do much typing, which then makes it not even fit for typing papers and e-mail.Overall I give this laptop a big fat ZERO.::amazonmik::1.0::February 22, 2014
R2GEMA0GZS8A3S::Good quality laptop, but some features are lacking::I bought this for my girlfriend because she wanted a quality, reliable laptop without paying a fortune. Overall, it's a pretty good laptop. It's not a gaming machine, by any means, but that's not what it was purchased for. The negatives are as follows:Offset touchpad - This thing is so far off to the left that it's almost uncomfortable to use. It's aligned directly behind the spacebar, but due to the full numberpad, the spacebar is not centered on the laptop itself. Also, it's very easy to accidentally hit the touchpad with the edge of your hand while typing. This can cause the cursor to move to some random point in a document, or cause you to accidentally click on a link on a webpage while you're filling out an entry field. Definitely an inconvenience, and definitely something that should have been thought of when Gateway was designing this product.Speakers - Point blank, the volume level at max is still a whisper. My iPhone has louder (and better quality) speakers than this laptop does.Those are the two major downsides to this product. It's a good laptop, but it's definitely got some flaws that people should be aware of before buying it.::NoxNoctura::3.0::March 3, 2012
R1XKSBL985BBTD::Excellent bang for your buck::Excellent laptop features second generation sandy bridge i3 processor which is more than capable of handling any power hungry programs.  The casing is beautiful and is a quality build being a gateway.  The lappy is also super cool and quiet which is a huge plus.  I didn't have any problem with the mouse, in fact I found it quite responsive and the keyboard is great.  I shopped around for months looking for a quality unit that is above an entry level laptop for an entry level price and this is it.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.::c::5.0::November 24, 2011
R108XOKJU0NWFW::great price for a great machine!!!::Intel i3 dual-core processor( two processors in one, can perform operations up to twice as fast as a single processor can), 4gb of RAM and 320 Gb of hard drive for a very low price! what are you waiting for!?!?Bougth this laptop on black friday. wanted to update my old gateway i have had for the last 4 years. I know gateway is not one of the "best" or biggest brands out there, but i must say that this is still a great product that can go face to face with Sony, Toshiba and HP.The only reason why i bought this laptop was because i have had a gateway for the last 4 years as i mentioned before, and never had any software or hardware problems with it. Its being 4 days since i got this laptop and it has worked perfect so far.hardware: It is just awesome! the fact that it does not look like any other laptop out there makes it unique. The texture and desing is  the keyboard is very easy and accesible, the F or "functions" keys are just very helpfull and easy to control. I think the best thing about it is that it has all you want to do built-in on the keyboard, so you don't have any " extra" keys outside the keyboard for the volume control, wifi or even changing songs. If you like simplicity and elegance, this computer will be a good choice for you for a great price, but if you thing gateway is not a good brand just get a MacBook Pro and spend $1200 on a machine that you  wont even make the most out of it. Bought it essentially for school projects and my social life ( Facebook, Youtube, MSN, Skype e.t.c). I have installed two games that require lots of RAM and i can say it does the work with very smooth graphis. ( the games are WOW and AOE III)It looks like they didn't do a very good job on the mouse pad, i have 4 main concerns about it:1. the mouse pad was placed to the very left side of the computer, and althought i haven't had any problem when typying, like another person that did a review on this previously, i will say that it looks like they made it just for left-handed people! sometimes it gets annoying when you have to move your right hand to the very left of the computer, but i guess is just a matter of time and getting used to it.2.The interaction with the mouse pad sometimes is a bit slow, when you put your finger on it, it takes about 1 or 2 seconds for the pad to recognize it and then you can move in the screen. I know it doesn't sound like a main concern but it will have a big effect when you are in a hurry and need to move along your windows really quick.3. the option to scroll down and up on the page ( to the very right side of the mouse pad) sometimes just doesn't work! It seems that it only does its job when you are working on a microsoft word document but when it comes to srcoll down on an internet browser MOST of the times doesn't work.4. They included a very nice feature on this mouse pad that i am sure most of you didn't know before. you can zoom in and out on the page that you are just by placing your two fingers next to each other and opening them(zoom in) or closing them ( zoom out), YES like a Mac! :) . Althought it's a great feature it doesn't work as perfect as it should, it frezzes or even do the oppossite SOMETIMES.15.6" is a very descent size, i am not a a very big fan of small computers. Althought the size may seem too much for some people, i just thing is the perfect size to do just anything. it is very light and thin and it won't get warm if you keep it on a flat surface ( i guess all new computers can do that).Overall is a great choice for a very descent price, i bought it for less than it is listed here but i will definitelly recomend this product to anyone out there willing to have a very elegant and unique product with the capabibilty of doing just anything on daily basis.any other question? ask me i will be more than happy to answer! :)::Raptor0135::4.0::December 7, 2011
R2R1H4ZZ1YCQHQ::Good Basic Laptop::I bought the Gateway NV55C56u, which is just a little update from the 54u, as a replacement for an older laptop with Windows Vista. It's performance with Windows 7 is better then the older Vista laptop, but from signon to fully ready to use is still slower then other Windows 7 Laptops. I upgraded the memmory to full 8GB for about $38 purchased from Amazon online. This was to get better performance when needed for graphic's etc. Initial setup was easy an only took a few minutes, then had to do about 8 or 9 Windows software updates once online The screen resolution is great and shows crisp images. I do not like the keyboard as much as on other laptop as it feels and looks cheaper. I also do not care for the on switch as it also feels like low quality. The offset of the touchpad to the left is a little more then other laptops and takes a while to get used to. I like the wireless and wired connections as it does process at a higher speed then older laptop that were 10/100. Have not used with webcam yet, but will update if I do use it::S.

R1U1R3S7NB037Z::Product unusable, seller juliojdavid refuses to repair/replace/refund::Computer began to glitch intermittently about once a week, refusing to start and going into auto-repair mode. After a month, this started happening several times each week and taking up to 8 hours before the computer would work again. Contacted juliojdavid numerous times, but since it was outside the 30-day Amazon refund window, they refused to repair, replace or refund, and since it's a refurbished computer, Gateway has no warranty. Computer is now useless, despite several clean install attempts.::Amazon Customer "Tim"::1.0::May 14, 2013
R1HNEOP07TB41P::Good except for 1 VERY ANNOYING factor::Negative comment first: I really like my (this) laptop especially for the price. I bought it for less than what it's priced now at Best Buy (I think it was on sale). Anyway, I never thought this mattered because it never was a problem before but the mouse thing (can't remember the name) is way on the left, so whenever I type, my cursor accidentally goes wherever the mouse is hovering over. That is very, very annoying! I always have to go back to what I'm typing because it suddenly jumps to places I don't intend. It would've also been okay if I could just easily press a button by the mouse pad thing to disable it while I'm typing but whoever their designer is thought it'd be better if you had to hit the Fn and F6 first at the same time. Also, they also figured it'd be best to hide the Del (delete) key since users probably won't be making mistakes often. What the...?What I like about this laptop is that the keys are easy to type with. Also, since I like using the actual number pad on the right of keyboards, I find it very helpful. The volume control is 1-touch too which is very good! I don't know if they made all of these Gateway laptop series like this but I like the texture(?) surface. It makes it look different from other laptops. It's like it has a black wooden finish. ha haI say, for the price, it's great. BUT, I probably wouldn't buy this product if I'll find myself needing to buy a laptop again just because of the mouse pad thing. I have small hands and I still keep accidentally touching it! But I guess I could get used to it since it only happened once while I'm typing these paragraphs. But then again, I've been mindful of that fact, so I guess I've been careful with my left palm (which I shouldn't have to be when typing). For the price though, I think I still got a deal.::ITSmarts::3.0::October 22, 2011
R1Z1T240V1YYGF::Inferior Laptop because of a crappy keyboard::I bought this laptop several months ago and thought it was a great buy, even though I read reviews that others didn't like the left sided keyboard.I thought that was great since I am a southpaw.  Well I got used to that then there was an issue with the touchpad causing the cursor to jump back in the sentence until I learned I could use a wireless mouse and Fn + F6 to disable the touchpad.I thought I was getting along with this laptop because it is fast and powerful, until a fly landed on the keyboard, which I lightly swatted with a thin newsletter.That was the end of my relationship with Gateway.  Now the keys just pop up or fall over and after some research I learned this is a very crappy keyboard.I wondered when I did searches on the Gateway NV55c I would see dozens of websites with the keyboard for sale anywhere from $15 to $30.You will either have to keep buying keyboards or purchase a separate usb or wireless keyboard eventually (but that kind of defeats the purpose of buyinga laptop.  I can say with confidence. I do not recommend this laptop because you cannot get an improved keyboard. You will always be stuck with a cheesy replacement and probably repeat the same problem, I will never buy another Gateway laptop. This is the crappiest keyboard I have EVER seen anywhere.  Once a key is dislocatedits never the same again and you are constantly popping them back in place. I now have 3 keys that will never again work the way they were intended to work. So I have a touchpad laptop that I MUST use a handheld mouse with and an external keyboard.Just point me to a barebones case that works so I can rebuild it, then I will be happyUPDATE: MARCH 16, 2013I still have this laptop, could not sell it, could not find a replacement keyboard thatwas any better than the existing one so I am stuck with this laptop I STILL DISLIKE.What I had to do was crazy glue the keys back on that kept popping off.  I still find that as timegoes on new keys will pop up and need to be fixed.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP EVER!::Frankie::1.0::October 25, 2012
R8RYVTNKKBVKU::LAPTOP IS GRADE A!::This laptop is the best it will do everything you need it to and more.I use it to record music and it runs the program great, download stuff from the internet wich it does fast and play games and they run great to. The picture is great when watching movies and the keyboard is real comfortably ALSO there is a hdmi plug so you can hook it up the the tv with ease.All and all lthis computer is great, i bought it about a yaer ago and it is one of the best investments i have ever made.if you got the money buy it::Huffinator::5.0::March 31, 2012

R2ZQ2B0G3LV5IO::Great for business::This computer has been good so far. I am use to using HP and this seems like a solid more bang for your buck alternative. There are three things that piss me off, (1) there is a goddamn "function" key where the control key is supposed to be! Very inconvenient for people that copy paste or use any other type of short cuts. (2) the power cord is freakin' huge. (3) there is no HDMI. But, otherwise it's a really beastly comp.::CAPI::4.0::March 7, 2013
R1T2N1Q6S1A43F::The Beast::There is a reason  the Lenovo people call this w520 thinkpad "The Beast" and is because it is a Beast it can handle anything , the performance is extraordinary and you can go all the way to 32GB of RAM beside all other things and is also a work station so I can go every were and the performance and speed are still extraordinary .::Gustavo Porras::5.0::August 18, 2013
R2MG4BU0UCNQZ3::Small with plenty of punch!::Got this as a lightning deal and was a little worried since there were only 2 reviews that weren't the best, but have been pleasantly surprised. We did a lot of research prior to stumbling upon this laptop. Were looking for a budget PC for around $500 that had plenty of memory, windows 7, fast processor, and ability to use as work/home on the go computer. Out of the box it does come loaded with a lot of Toshiba non-sense but a free downloaded start-up mechanic helped us remove all the stuff that we didn't want and now it starts even faster. Takes about 40 seconds to start fully up and connect to our wireless. Out of the box it took about a minute with all the Toshiba stuff, but now is much faster and the intel processer makes it feel like you could have 20 things going at once with no speed delays! It's about 5 pounds and it feels like a mini-laptop when toting it around, but is much faster and screen resolution is really great compared to our 2 year-old 17 inch laptop!It took about an hour to update all the windows software that was out of date, but with the processor and memory space, it would have probably taken double to triple that on a different machine.All in all, this is a pretty good budget friendly laptop that is very mobile and actually performs very well when tasked with having an Excel spreadsheet and word document open, 3 internet explorer windows and photo-shop photo editing all at the same time. I think the price of around $500 is a very reasonable deal and although it takes a bit of getting used to the smaller keyboard/screen compared to my old 17-inch - it's been well worth it thus far! Would recommend this machine to anyone who needs a basic laptop to take to work and use as a personal machine at home.::Golden Arm::5.0::December 3, 2011
R3I8OPWIPHINE::Perfect for school::I have had this laptop for a week now and i am very happy with it. Lightweight, powerful and full of features.. Perfect for me to take to class everyday. =)Update: about three weeks after purchase my laptop crashed.. would not turn on.. amazon quickly replaced it and have had no problems since... maybe it was a defective? i am still very happy with my laptop. i would suggest to buy a warranty with it, just in case. amazon is simply amazing with returns!::N. Pauley::5.0::December 2, 2011
R1FU37RMQCORUF::The Good and the Bad::I used this laptop for 3 weeks after getting a great "lightning deal" of $430. So it was worth a try with good application performance and adequate screen and keyboard. Downsides for me are that it is much heavier and gets about half the battery life as the Portege R835 we purchased last spring. I would have kept the L735 because of the great price but the breaking point came during a "recommended" bios update from Toshiba which led to a "verify error" and a dead machine. I've seen reports of this happening to other Satellite owners so I no longer trust the L735 and am replacing it with another Portege. If you get a Satellite, I'd recommend not doing a flash bios update yourself and if the machine is working ok, just leave it alone.::Tom Patton::3.0::January 1, 2012
R1O7PVCNLYI3QR::Merry Christmas to Me!::Received this on Monday after ordering it on Black Friday morning...I was going to wait until closer to Christmas for prices to drop but couldn't pass this buy up. This is my 2nd Toshiba laptop. That one is a Qosmio that is 5 years old that the family is now using. I wanted something smaller and lighter to carry back and forth to work. This is ideal! Also, since my hands are small the keyboard is the perfect size. It doesn't have Bluetooth, which I can live without, but it has every thing else I was looking for and the case is beautiful.Merry Christmas to me!!!::C. Collett::5.0::December 2, 2011
R2JIXEMY1E7EF7::Beware of product and tech support!::All I can say is Wow, what a horrible experience I had with this Toshiba Laptop! I bought this item using an Gold Deal for a fair price. I was looking for a small laptop for basic items and easy portability. This seemed to fit the need with an i5 processor and decent memory and hard drive space. At first everything seemed to work fine then about a week later I started to have trouble with charging the battery. It would not charge while plugged in and drain the battery when the AC adapter was plugged in. I called Toshiba and they told me it was an AC power adapter and they would send me one but would have to charge me for it! I was shocked, this laptop was only a couple weeks old and they would charge me 91 dollars for an AC adapter. After getting the new AC adapter, the unit still had the same problem but now it would not hold a charge in the battery for more than a day when shut off. I contacted them again and they said they would not replace the unit but if I sent it in to their repair facility they would attempt a repair and send it back! This could have taken 6-8 weeks to accomplish!!! At this time I was completely frustrated and boxed the unit back up and returned it to Amazon. The only good thing I can say about this whole mess is Amazon was quick and prompt with the return process and made the transaction virtually painless! If only Toshiba had this level of service maybe I would still have the machine and be using it today!::TechJunkie "EricT"::1.0::January 10, 2012
R21KDDHCI0KRPG::Fast, quick, good for a first laptop!::I've had many laptop in the past, but this has been by far the best one I have ever bought. The features it comes with are amazing. The only thing I don't like about it are the speakers. The quality of them isn't that great. But you get use to them. I always end up plugging in my bigger speakers cause these ones sometimes just can't do the job. Overall, its fast, small, compact, has a good webcam and a good microphone. I'd recommend this to an student entering college who is in need of a good laptop. I personally love the sleep and charge feature. Saves me a lot of time. Its good for portability and the battery is amazing!::Aneta::5.0::December 13, 2011

R2QIE575K6EAQ7::I love my new laptop::This is my second Toshiba laptop, the first one i still have it's going on five years come February 2012. The old one still works well but i needed something i could carry around, with more speed and space. This one is ideal for that it is great for studying purposes and watching movies too and it is also pretty fast. I was worried about purchasing it because when i did there were no customer reviews. Imagine buying something like a laptop without having a clue about how it works. Well I took a chance because of the fact that the product brand Toshiba is generally a trustworthy one. I have it about a week now and so far i have no regrets...::C.Natalia Dillon "Carpe Diem"::5.0::December 17, 2011
R3UX7PL9FU97HX::Black Screen::Purchased in December of 2011 and crashes (black screen) on February 5th, 2012.  I call Toshiba support and they say I incorrectly installed an update (which is not the truth) and the cost would be all mine.  Toshiba is junk tech support (I had to call back several times because my call was conveniently dropped) and so is their computer.

RQAPWKR1SKB3I::works slowly then breaks::This Toshiba was purchased on 12/3/2011. Out of the box it was disappointingly slow. So slow that my 12 year old son wold not even use it. The hard drive failed in November 2012. It was shipped it to Toshiba for repair under warrantee - my cost to ship. The computer was returned mid December 2012. It worked but it was no faster. The hard drive failed again in April 2013. Toshiba refuses to fix it because it is out of warrantee.  When the computer worked it was slow and crashed often and now it is a worthless paperweight in less than 18 months. Bottom line DO NOT purchase this laptop, it was a complete waste of money.::Eric Tripp Fortuna::1.0::April 12, 2013
R1RPAPQGGE2MB0::Small, powerful, and easily broken::I ordered this Toshiba Satellite because my old one was too out of date at 7 years old. It was still running well enough that I gave it away to a needy family. I've had this newer Toshiba for 18 months now.I was not been disappointed with this laptop until it died on me suddenly. The power cord inserts into plastic housing that breaks if you are unlucky enough to apply any force to the power jack. The gray dot design is very attractive, but a little prone to scratches. Also, I managed to crack the space in front of the headphone jack by picking it up by the corner.When I first received my new Toshiba, I updated the BIOS as recommended. That bricked my 5 day old laptop, so I returned it to Amazon (thanks for good service, Amazon!). Toshiba was not very helpful, but my problem was solved. I should have seen the warning sign for what it was.I loved my Toshiba Satellite L735. It had an SD card slot and HDD vibration protection! I had such great experience with Toshiba laptops until this one came along. 18 months! Maybe I can sell the perfectly functioning parts that simply cannot get power anymore.::H.

I have to wait for a long time for restarting, and the battery last much shorter than the description. I contacted Toshiba, the changed battery for me.

RAWSQINQ8CQAL::A quality product::I'm very pleased with this machine. Toshiba seems to be putting out quality laptops at present. I have been very disappointed with Dells over the last 5 years or so, I think Dell quality has hit rock bottom. They were pretty good when they came out, now they are trying to capitalize on name brand.  Just read the reviews and you can get a clear picture.  Those who buy Sony all say something like "OMG dude! Pink laptop, how coolzors is dat!"  Reviews for Toshibas are all about best performance against various objective benchmarks and intelligent technical discussion of what is under the hood.I've had this for about 2 months now with no problems. It performs very well right out of the box. Removing some bloatware was very easy (I'm not sure if it made much difference as I did it right away). The keyboard is very good for a laptop of this size. I have no idea what customer service is like as I have had no reason to find out yet. It is light enough to take anywhere, yet powerful enough to crank out 10k iterations of an MCMC chain faster than your grandma can knit one row. It seems pretty sturdy (yes, klutz that I am, I've already dropped it, flushed it down the toilet, set it on fire, backed my car over it ... well ok, maybe nothing so bad, but it has had some relatively rough treatment).Reliability and performance are what matters for me, looking cool is irrelevant but it actually does that too. Highly recommended.::Bvalltu::5.0::December 28, 2011
RTLZ99UWO9A04::Don't do it::I love the size, weight, and battery length of the computer. Overall, I would say I am satisfied. As a writer, though, I find two features annoying. First, it comes with Microsoft Word Starter which suits me fine. However, there is a constant ad to buy the complete package that you are unable to close, which means that a third of the screen space is taken up by a constant ad. And the ad moves, so it catches your eye every few seconds--distracting. Second, the computer updated and rebooted without warning in the middle of my work time. Auto save did not work, and I lost an entire page of writing. If you plan to buy the full Microsoft package or don't mind a constant ad, then you will love this computer. Word of warning, though: save your work frequently to avoid losing it like I did. *A year later, and I must amend my review: I'm on my 3rd return for repairs--first it was the battery, and then the display. The customer service reps are friendly, but far away in India and sometimes hard to understand. I can't, in good conscience, recommend this laptop after the plethora of issues I've faced.::Vanessa Bartal "vgbartal"::1.0::January 29, 2012

R1L2B57QICIU46::Excelente Laptop::Es una muy buena compra, la pantalla tiene muy buena resolucion, es liviana, las aplicaciones por el momento trabajan bien con respecto a edicion de video. El teclado es comodo, sin numeros, webcam y microfono bien, reconocimiento facial trabaja bien aunque es mas rapido ingresas por contraseña.Los 2 unicos 2 problemas son:En las especificaciones dice 4 GB RAM 1x4GB, y en realidad son 4 GB RAM 2x2GB, entonces para aumentar la RAM toca cambiar de memoria.Viene con Windows 7 Home 64 Bits y en esta version no puedes cambiar el idioma, solo puedes cambiar en Windows 7 Ultimate y el upgrade cuesta como 130 dolares mas, pero si lo vas a utilizar solo en ingles funciona perfecto.Listo creo que es una muy buena compra esta Laptop, si no vas a aumentar la memoria RAM y la trabajas en ingles es de 5 estrellas, como yo voy a aumentar RAM y preferia en español le doy 4 estrellas.::Daniel::4.0::January 11, 2012
RPM5LXY76HWMM::All you need in a laptop!::I bought this little laptop for my wife last week to replace her aging Dell Inspiron e1505 (which was also a fantastic laptop), and I can tell you (as an IT expert since 1979) that this is the best bang for the buck out there in the world of laptops!  The only thing missing is that it does not have USB 3.0 (which some specs say it has, but it does not).  You can't beat the new Intel i5 2nd generation CPU for speed (Sandy Bridge Core), and the Intel HD graphics are fine unless you plan to be playing games with high demand on video.  You can easily upgrade the memory from 4 to 8gb for cheap, and the 500gb hard drive should be plenty for 98% of folks out there.  We got ours at Best Buy for $450 plus tax.  Take my advice and don't spend more for a laptop - you don't need to.  Also, keep in mind that if a laptop breaks it usually isn't worth getting it fixed unless it is really simple, or you can do it yourself (as I do).  So, don't invest BIG money (not over $600 in my opinion) in one.  My 2 cents based on many years of experience.::Stephen J. Van Osdell "tabsaw"::5.0::November 6, 2011

R2AIE212AKZVI1::does it all, and for a decent price too::Lets be basic. Here are the pros and cons.PROS:As long as you don't run super intense programs, or high graphics on games, the computer functions very well.Comes with I5. Its much better than I3, and you will see the difference.For a laptop, it has a GIANT screen. In today's world 15.6" may not seem like a large screen but when you get your hands on it, it is.Portable. Fits in any case and is easy to carry around.3 USB drives. 2 on the right and 1 on the left. you would be amazed with how convenient it is to have USB drives on each side of the computer.60 day free norton security. After that you have to pay, but for internet security, norton is great. While its only 60 days, it avoids the hassle of installing and paying for it on the website.Windows 7 is great.for the 500 bucks, its a great value.The touch pad works wellCONS:when you use it for a while, the computer starts to heat up. While it doesn't affect performance, it just makes you a little weary about the computer, and can be uncomfortable at times. (but during the winter it is amazing.)while it can run many games at decent settings, you will not be able to play games at maxed out settings.There is no obvious visual division between the left and right click. While when you use it you will figure it out, it can be a little confusing at first.the F1-F12 buttons also serve as the display buttons. so if you need to hit any F# button, you need to hold down (Fn). It is just a little hassle.OVERALL:Great laptop for daily use and basic gaming. Takes a little while to get used to the little differences. Good price, good hardware, good buy.::Glasses::5.0::January 24, 2012
R2Q3PY76WOT6XJ::Good lappy. Odd USB locations::The laptop does everything I'd expect it to. The keyboard is nice to use, everything feels quality enough. It may not be top of the line, but it's certainly powerful enough to do anything I need it to do. The screen quality is solid. The only complaint is the odd placement of the USB ports near the front side of the case. It can interfere with some accessories a little.::Kell::4.0::January 31, 2014
R3EQOWVXKGESY9::3 years of daily use::Great pc... Wish it had blue tooth it never said it had usb 3.0.... It always said it had 3 usb ports... No problems::D N "shopper!"::5.0::August 10, 2013
R5EG7KSZJGNAT::light for its size, cool, number pad but no bluetooth::For a 15  inch notebook, this only weighs 5.65 lbs which is really light for its size. I upgraded from a 14 inch 4.65 lb notebook and the difference is significant but not too bad. I have a bad back but when I carry it to school I don't feel that its too heavy. I can definitely feel it there but its really not bad. Its still this light even though it has an optical drive with it which my previous notebook didn't. Not bluray though..The keyboard is unique because its similar to mac where you can see a little bit of the metal casing between the keys (like a chiclet keyboard).The touchpad buttons are a little annoying because you have to put a lot of pressure to press. The side of the touchpad has little arrow markings for scrolling. You just slide your finger up to scroll up and vice versa.The thickness of this thing is amazingly thin at around 0.85 inches. Everything but the screen is nice and matte although its not necessarily the coolest design around.This thing is really quiet (at least from what I'm used to anyway). You can barely hear it most of the time. The keyboards are a bit loud though but I think most laptops are like that. It stays cool and you can put it on your lap. It won't scald you but it will feel a little warm.This is really fast. I was planning on putting in an SSD but I really don't think its necessary because its really fast. Boot time is under 30 seconds. Haven't really timed it yet but its really fast.Screen is nice and big. Its glossy so it has better colors but don't use it against the light because all you will see is your reflection and glare. Might work with a very light background though..No problems watching HD videos on youtube. Nice and smooth. Don't know about gaming because I don't really do games.. I'm horrible and I always die in the first stage.  I do use adobe light room and it runs quite smoothly.Lack of bluetooth may be a deal breaker for some.. Sheesh every laptop should have bluetooth. You can buy one of those USB bluetooth devices but I hate that I have to.::leslie7622::4.0::August 18, 2012
R3803FJ5QBOCD::This product does not have USB 3::It says it has USB 3 but it does not. It looks like one but is not recognized as one, this has been commented on by others, including an IT professional. In addition the track pad did not work and the dvd would not eject. I returned for refund but did not get the full amount back. I lost money on shipping and insurance. Do your research before you buy.Gateway NV57H44u i5-2430M Laptop PC::Jeffrey L Howard::2.0::April 10, 2012
R2K8ZF9UMMXTYA::Gateway NV57H44u Core i5-2430M Laptop PC review::I paid a bit too much for it, $540.00, but it's a very good computer and I would recommend it highly.::Frank R. Lawler::4.0::March 15, 2012
R3HND9IZ7SKYLF::Hot chick::I like my laptop except for 2 things.  The speakers are pretty quiet and the keys on the keyboard are flat so it is easy to hit the wrong keys.::Rena F. Reynolds::4.0::February 9, 2012
R39JYJC3TA7PZB::Very happy at first, not so much now::Bought it at Best Buy for just under $490 after taxes. Had everything I wanted, mostly the processor (which is pretty awesome). The very first one I bought had a broken left-mouse button. Managed to return it through Best Buy at another store (was the last one in stock in San Antonio). The second one (that I have now) worked flawlessly for about two months.Now, the cooling fan barely works. The laptop gets as hot as an oven under load and I either have to send it back to Gateway for "7 to 10 business days" once they receive it from out of state "if the parts are available", or pay a local shop $150 to fix it. That and out of the box, the speakers are laughably quiet. I ended up having to spend an hour on google to finally figure out how to increase the volume output to a level I could actually hear my music above the normal ambient sounds of a house (which isn't much).As for performance, it's fast. Damn fast. The only gripes I have about performance is for video games, this thing is a pig. And that's 100% because of the GPU. I knew this going into it, buying an Intel over AMD (I wanted the raw power), but I truly did not expect the video performance to be so bad. Playing HD videos and DVDs, it does great. But for lower end games like SWTOR (the new big MMO), this thing can run it find, with EVERYTHING on low settings. Not an issue for that kind of game, but it still sucks. It does handle StarCraft II fairly well, though turned down as well. (Those are the only games I've played on it, so take from that what you will).That I'm going to end up shelling out $50 for parts to have to repair it myself after only owning it for three months, I am not happy. I'd be less happy paying someone else more to do it, or sending it to Gateway and very likely getting it back in ANOTHER three months.All in all, I wish I'd have bought the ugly brown HP they had next to it. Same specs exactly, but it was an ugly brown, and it was HP. That Gateway is now an ACER company played heavily in my decision to buy this thing (not crazy about the blue, but at least it wasn't turd brown), as ACER and I go back a decade, and their computers and parts have always been beyond good to me. Until now.::Me::2.0::January 12, 2012
RJOVBTZIBEOU::Don't know yet, but a good price.::Bought it today at Bestbuy for $399.00. Took the very last from the shelf, people around were NOT happy about it. A couple ladies were waiting for me to change my mind and put it back. I will use it and write a review. I am not a gig at all though.::Juank::5.0::November 26, 2011
R1MJFJW9PF72QZ::Nice laptop::I bought two of these for Xmas presents for my grandchildren.  I powered them up and personalized them.  One thing I noticed right away is that when you plug in a mouse, the smart pad is automatically disabled.  I love that!  My own Asis laptop does not, so when you type you can accidently cause unintended commands to happen.The screen is bright and large.  It has a full numeric keypad.  Bloatware is minimal.  The wireless connects instantly and pulls in a strong signal.  It has an attractive outer surface which makes it look like a high end unit.On the negative side, like many new notebooks, the cover does not latch when closed, but the hinge is very tight and it stays closed.Battery life and reliability will need to wait to be tested till after the holidays.Update:  A person asked about the speakers.  They are typical of laptop speakers in that they are not very good for music or movies but acceptable for speech.  But is there a laptop of this size that is good for music or movies?::T.

R1WP65ZLVQ2Y5D::Love it::I have had my Toshiba for about a week now and I love it. The keyboard does show every finger print and looks really greasy after its been used for a bit but that is easy enough to wipe down. The laptop is big but is relatively lightweight. The shell has a nice textured look but feels smooth so it doesn't show fingerprints all over which is nice. There is a number pad to the right of the keyboard which I really like, especially for games like WoW. Overall I would say it is quick, however booting up and shutting down can take a while but it runs WoW nicely. The battery life is not that bad. If I am using it unplugged I get about 3-5 hours depending on what I am doing. I love Win 7, I think it is soooooooooo much better than Vista like my old Toshiba had. It comes with minimal bloatware and even already had Google Chrome installed, which is great because I am a big google user. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who needs a laptop for daily use or school and even some light gaming.::mdjohn::5.0::December 28, 2011
R1WLZLKTXE6OGB::Just a wonderful laptop. Thank you Toshiba.::Bought this Toshiba 15.6 inch laptop last week for business travel. I am just loving it. Great quality and style. All my family members have Toshiba laptops. My wife has the 17 inch version that we bought last year from Amazon. We still use the 5 year old Toshiba 14 inch with Windows XP laptop in our guest room. Over the years I have had a variety of different brands. We stay with Toshiba because the internal components just last. Never a problem.::Sherwin Lee Hornick::5.0::December 27, 2011
R2SIAJ4SXCWZT2::DON'T BUY TOSHIBA::I'm deeply disgusted with Toshiba, With there product and there customer service. First day I have had this computer, I have had nothing but problems. Extremely slow and freezes all the time until the hard drive gave out. Toshiba paid for shipping to send it back to them to fix it. Did that and waited weeks without a computer. Came back with nothing but problems, even worse. After having it for a few days, it completely quit.It won't even turn on. To let you know I did upgrade the ram to 8 gigs. So anyway I called and the claims department was'int open, 8am to 5pm. It shows Toshiba does'int care about there customers. Finally I got to talk to them the next day after they waited to call me later in the day. I express to them I use it for work and they did'int care about that. I ask them for a refund, they told me no and told me to bring it back to the store. After owning this laptop for a few months they should of known that is impossible. I ask for express shipping, they told me that can't happen. The attitude I got from them was unnecessary. Even if I was upset. Being upset with them should have been expected considering the circumstances. Customer is all ways right. Three days without my computer, three days without there box there sending me to ship the computer. Don't make the same mistake I did, DON'T BUY TOSHIBA.::Td Bank Gift Card "Daniel Stubbs"::1.0::December 23, 2011
RIX7SMMD9G1R9::I have a similar model L755-S5245::Whatever you do DO NOT UPDATE THE BIOS! Toshiba products have a high rate of failure after attempting a BIOS UPDATE. I have to replace my bios chip, possibly the motherboard and have to pay the guy for labor. The bios chips are about $10-15.00, the motherboards are about $ 200.00 and the labor is 75.00 an hour. It is not worth that much. For that price I can get several other used laptops with better options. If you don't believe me then do your research and also research how to fix the bios when the screen does not come back on after the failed update. If you want to update your bios take it to a professional before doing it yourself.::makeminelatte::3.0::September 7, 2013
R1JDAOOII8U5YW::Be careful::whatever you do keep your virus software updated!! i didnt now my laptop has become victim to death..replacing the parts and software is going to cost more than the laptop is worth. other than that i love it! i miss it! im saving up for a new laptop::Amanda::4.0::April 8, 2013
R8EQYLRFOBEKH::sound is not good!::I have owned computers for aprox 25 years.  With the purchase of this laptop I was not looking for a high end model.  I just wanted dependability and fairly basic functions. I would have liked this laptop very much,  but the one problem that blew the whole deal for me is the low volume of the internal speakers.I even returned the first model back to the store and still have the same problem with the replacement model.  The internal speakers are way too quiet.  I have tried all the usual common fixes, volumne settings, control panel,  along with uninstalling and reinstalling the sound drivers and updating the same.  The speaker issue is not a small one to me.  I have plugged in four different types of external speakers and headphones and most of which gave some improvement, but the volume was turned up to its max and it still was not completely audible for movies and such.I am very disappointed that Toshiba while making what seems to me a good laptop cannot provide decent speakers. That is a basic!::lima::3.0::November 22, 2011
R1M3KC5GV8MOVL::A perfectly good laptop for what most people do with laptops::My Dell Inspiron 15 N5040 included 3gb of RAM and i3-2.53ghz cpu.  I do intend to upgrade the RAM to 8GB but will be adding that separately.  Dell's pricing on memory upgrades is absurd. so I just ordered 2x4GB (8GB) of Crucial memory on Amazon for $40.  Installing them just involves lifting the keyboard out.  For what most people do with their computers in the average day, this laptop is perfect.  A lot of people think they need the fastest, newest, most expensive computer out there and nowadays, that doesn't have to be the case.  Most of us aren't graphic designers or movie editors, so why spend hundreds more? For web browsing, email, skype calling, watching netflix, photo editing, and even movie editing (better with 8GB memory), I have had no issues at all.  It's a bit plain looking aesthetically, but I don't think that's a bad thing. Compared to the DELL XPS 15z, which I also own, it's only slightly thicker, which I found surprising since Dell has been touting how thin the XPS 15z is.  It does have an off center mousepad which I found annoying since I'm  used to them being centered.  I found myself inadvertently hitting the right button when reaching for the left button.  That is just a minor issue though.  Another down side is the battery life.  The standard battery doesn't last too long so keep the charger handy and stay near power outlets.  I've been getting about 3 hours of battery life while web browsing.  I would recommend this to product to anyone looking for an affordable everyday laptop.::Kevin Jones::4.0::December 11, 2011
R1TO7MQ1HFEBWF::Im Excited About My Dell::This Is A Good Computer, And Overall A Good Bargain.But see their are things you have to adjust to.Here are the Pros:Big 15.6 Inch Screen.I don't know if it is safe to say this laptop's keys sort of resemble and feel like a mac's keyboard.anyways...The keys are a plus.Nice screen colors due to the default intel hd graphics.it is a lightweight machine sort of feels like it to me.for $400-$470 it is a hell of a bargain,it does its job.Cons: I haven't seen any at all.Highly Recommend.Enjoy.

RAVEEUBWLAKZ5::Dell Inspiron 15 i15-N5040 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black)::I've been a Dell fan for quite some time, and as expected, this little gem confirms why.  Repeatable performance and Dell dependability in a sleek, easy to manage package.  The price point for comparable units makes this purchase a true bargain, coupled with Amazon ease of ordering and confidence in the Amazon market place partners makes it that much more enjoyable.  The seller, J-Tech Digital, was spot on perfect, caught a shipping error on my part and notified me by email soon after the order was placed.  The J-Tech Digital Customer Service Team corrected my oversight, shipped it ULTRA FAST and took the time to follow up after the sale.  Other retailers could learn a thing or two here.  Very impressive indeed.::Markus Bee::5.0::December 22, 2011
R1V5Z73V37AJWH::Good product according to the price::This is a good basic laptop. It has a lot of potential if you upgrade the ram memory.PROS:+ Got it brand new for under 500 US$.+ Intel core i3 is a really good microprocesor.+ DDR3 memory support up to 8GB of ram.+ Works well in high temperatures and it does not overheat like HP laptop's.CONS:- Touchpad sucks.- Only comes with 3GB of ram out of the box.Neutral:~ The keyboard is very basic.~ Screen is ok (it's advertised as a LED screen but i can't see the difference between this and a normal 2008 LCD screen).I'm happy with this product, but i'll definitely buy a memory upgrade to enhance the performance..::jbendahan::4.0::January 7, 2012
R3T85EPKSXZKS0::Great Laptop::I have no complaints, although making the recovery discs didnt go well. Went thru 4 dvd's and then got a "failure" on the 4th disc. Called Dell support and the tech said this is a known problem and he said to use a 8GB flash drive. Sorry all mine are 4 or 6GB and i'm not going to go and spend money on a 8GB fd just to make up a backup Recovery.Battery life could be better, only get about 4 hours out of it on the basic mode...Over all this laptop is worth the money, it is fast and so far works great.::freshcope::5.0::December 30, 2011
R11WE1KQC7U1WJ::Done with Dell::Bought mine in mid 2012. iOversensitive touchpad. Cursor jumping all over. Called Dell tech line. Took over an hour and a supervisor to improve to the point it was at least usable. Over time problem crept back. Fair correction by adjusting keyboard & cursor speed down.Meanwhile, internet research showed many others had same problem. Again, problem slowly got worse for me. Computer once more to the point of unusable. Cursor jumps all over, closing/opening pages, deleting etc. unless cursor constantly manually repositioned.Called tech line again. Now I'm out of warranty, so no help unless I cough up over a hundred bucks. Called customer servicade. Too bad too sad, Pay or no help.Complaints about this issue go back to 2009. Dell knows it is a major issue. It has been an ongoing issue for me since buying the computer. They should have a free fix available for a problem THEY created.Otherwise, I loved this little laptop. But it is just a paperweight now.::Kathryn A. Hughes::1.0::April 11, 2014
R2GZZM8D90S1MI::6 year old proof::Okay, well quite honestly had I have been purchasing a computer this would not have been my primary choice.  I had a Toshiba and was perfectly content with this.  But, a relative purchased this & realized that they were completely computer illiterate so ended up buying this for next to nothing.  This computer has been the most durable computer I've ever ever had.  I have a tendency to break laptops, which is why I swore my next computer would be a desktop.  My first two laptops suffered broken screens (another Dell & a Compaq) my Toshiba's keyboard fried after typing a quick msg after getting out the shower with slightly damp hands.  This Dell that I am currently typing this review on has been dropped, things spilled on, and taken so many blunt hits.  Let me explain, I have a 6 year old technology hating computer killer.  She has successfully dropped this laptop from a kitchen table.  This computer hit so hard it knocked the hard drive out.  She then decided that instead of moving the computer after the hard drive was pushed back in, she was going to knock it off the couch because she wanted to sit down.  Nothing major happened to the computer.  So, computer killer decides she's going to spill her morning orange juice on it when she's watching Monster High on Youtube.  Screen changes colors and tweaks out making a hissing sound.  I thought that my PC avenger had finally toasted the laptop.  Ten minutes later, computer is working like new.  The computer then became a Play-Doh molder.  The buttons really took that hard.  They are impossible to take off without taking apart the computer, so we waited and waited and as the playdoh became more crusty it shank and fell out.  Keyboard works great.  I know this is probably a pointless argument for purchasing a laptop -- but I know there has to be other computer crushers in other households, and if you have one, this is your laptop.::A.

R3K3JOSW282F97::bought at bestbuy during the $299 deal, love it::I bought this computer mainly because it was on sale. After getting home with it I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and look of the materials used for the chasis. It just looks tough and beautiful. I get nothing but great comments from my friends and how nice it looks.To top it off the fingerprint sensor is great for quick unlocking, detects instantly and accurately. The face recognition is a little slower, especially if you are in a badly lit area. At $299 this was a STEAL of a deal! at anything $400 or less this is still a good deal! I wouldn't pay more than 400 just because i3 prices are coming down and that performance cant be ignored. This is a fast laptop, ALMOST to first gen i3 levels, but not the 2nd gen i3.::elcompudoctor::5.0::November 23, 2011
R2TSG9DW55BWNR::Great value, possibly under-priced...::I got this laptop at Best Buy for $289 plus tax and recycle fee which turned out to be about $335 out the door. I've had it for about 3 months so far and it's been awesome. It runs quiet, doesn't get hot and the display is very bright - I actually dim the display a bit during normal use because the highest setting is too bright for me. It boots up at an average of about 35 seconds. Everything has been running smoothly. Performance wise, I don't know how it compares to other laptops in it's range, but I haven't had any performance based issues as of yet, but then I don't run high performance games or apps on it either...They keyboard is is very user friendly. The speakers could be a bit louder, but headphones can easily fix that. It feels pretty solid, not flimsy. Overall I'm thoroughly satisfied and I can't believe it was as cheap as it was...::Jam::5.0::January 1, 2012
R2DWNS4K9EOI5::Lenovo - horrible customer service, no recourse::I purchased this laptop new from BestBuy on 12/14/11.  In May 2012, 6 months later, it just stopped working. Called customer service and they're completely on script. Told me from the error message that they'd need to reinstall the operating system at a "nominal" ($170ish) fee.  But the error message, according to all the research I'd done, indicated that the hard drive was probably bad, nothing to do with the operating system. The out of country help desk people are completely nonresponsive, there is NO e-mail address for technical support so there's no evidence of their faulty advice. Basically I have a $400 paperweight.  So beyond frustrated with them.::Christine Bennor::1.0::June 27, 2012

R2JS4NWJGN1OLT::Lenovo B570 terrible notebook & customer service::I purchased this notebook for my son in mid-December 2011. Within 3 months the unit started freezing during boot. Within 2 weeks, the unit was completely dead. No, there were no viruses on the unit. Sent in to Lenovo for service. At the same time we purchased an onsite service warranty. 3 weeks later, with new motherboard and hard drive the machine was finally returned to us. We didn't have the opportunity to use the unit for 3 more weeks due to other engagements. Within 24 hours of using the machine again it was doing the same thing as before - freezing during boot. Called Lenovo, they said technician will call within 3 business days to service unit. We got a call and set up an appointment. On day of service we got another call saying the parts that the technician was to bring with had not been ordered. Evidently Lenovo has a bunch of incompetents working there. Apparently we have another technician appointment for next week. We'll seen where we end up this time. More to follow ...In case you're wondering, I would NOT recommend Lenovo products to anyone anytime!::capey::1.0::June 1, 2012
R1P9NIAJP8AC6F::Nice laptop::There are actually 421 GB of hard drive space so that is plus. The battery life is usually around 4 hours depending on what you do with it at the time. 4 usb ports makes it nice to be able to multi task too.

R2H6EE8WTXNFTO::Best value for college student or professional!  Fantastic laptop!::Being a college student who needs access to a computer almost every day for a variety of tasks, I was in the market for a laptop with relatively high processing power and good battery life.  When I stumbled on the Toshiba Portege R835-P84, I knew it was the perfect laptop for my needs. I have had it for almost a year and could not be more satisfied. The main pros about this little machine are this:-it has an Intel i5 processor (2.40 GHz, 3.00 GHz with Turbo Boost Technology) which allows it to boot up very fast and can handle multiple programs running at once with ease-it has a 640 GB hard drive capacity which is quite impressive for such a small computer, it means I don't need to consider an external hard drive to store school file-the battery life is awesome...I have been achieving about 6-7 hours w/o charging and thats while the computer is being used for writing papers, browsing the web, you name it-it weighs just over 3 pounds and is super compact (I don't even feel it in my backpack)-despite being a 13-inch laptop and weighing only 3 pounds, it still has a CD/DVD drive!-comes standard with a spill resistant keyboard and HDMI port-if the computer senses an impact, the hard drive is automatically shifted into a safe position so that files are not lost (it is actually quite sensitive and you can hear it happen if you pick up the laptop quickly or abruptly...however this feature can be disabled easily by going into the settings)-the frame is very sturdy and feels solid when carried-it's Energy Star Certified and has a really cool Toshiba Eco program where you can monitor power usage in watts and adjust power settings depending on your needsThe few cons are the following:-doesn't come with Bluetooth (I don't understand why not, but I don't really use it that anyway)-the keys on the keyboard are kind of flat and may take getting used to...I did and now love writing papers with it-the speakers are average-the left and right click buttons are rather loud when clicked, I usually tap the touchpad for left clickOverall, you probably can't find a better laptop in this price range and I really enjoy working or just having fun with it.  I think this laptop is equal to and beats the MacBook in many aspects including processing and features, and at less than 2/3 the price, it's definetely a good bargain.::Don::5.0::October 1, 2012
R1FT3R5BUUOS4M::Loving it!::Did much research for an ultralight computer to replace my heavy weight Dell laptop. This was just what was needed.::Stephanie Richardson::5.0::June 6, 2013
RZOV78UDB0VIH::I love this laptop::I bought this laptop a few weeks ago. The laptop is almost the same as the P81/p56x version, but was sold at lower price because of many sellers. It's very light in hand, the color is what I like. The only issue I found is that the keyboard doesn't feel as good as my old Thinkpad T61. But for a 13" laptop, I shouldn't complain about it at all.::GM::5.0::February 28, 2012
R28DVVMMV4206F::internet dangle is easy to be broken.::i like this machine, but the internet adapter is easy to be broken. The plug is too thin. the original adapter was broken within three months.::zhongkui::3.0::June 16, 2013

R1OBZ4B0ES093W::Fast, beautiful, quiet. Sound is not good.::Great computer!!Fast: Core I3 + 4GB DDR3?? Awesome for this price...Beautiful. Neat. Sober. Love it.Both cooler and DVD drive are extremely quiet.Doesn't heat up, not even during high processor workload.Sound is not good: if you demand high sound quality, this is not for you; TRUST ME.Shipping was flawless and the product was in perfect shape.::Julia Taleisnik::4.0::December 10, 2011
RTCNJ6MN22IU9::Great all around laptop::Purchased this laptop to replace my first and more expensive laptop. By far, this machine is tops in its class. It is fast, quiet, cool, and runs everything I throw at is just fine. The only downside, is that the sound quality is minimal at best. The battery life on this unit is about 6 hours with normal power settings.::Bruce::4.0::February 23, 2012
R1E9BF9VIP9IVP::Toshiba C655-SS206::Everything as advertised, great battery life, large disk and internal memory to meet my program requirements. Display seemed a little less bright than other I have seen but the overall price/performance was hard to beat. Shipping was quick at two days.::Christopher R Chismire::4.0::February 10, 2012
R2QT87Y1BB3F7D::Great innovative in Technology::Toshiba C655-S5206 is great innovative in technology the speed overwhelming the HD graphics superseeds the rest it's a great investment and I recomend to anyone interested in purchasing a laptop Toshiba is the way to go for durability and within reasonable budget.::Reynold Haywood::5.0::December 24, 2011
ROKSLQ5VKUY6O::Eh. Faulty hinge design. Needs revision, and not durable at all::Like the title says, the hinge design is not good, and it needs to be rethought out. The plastic casing isn't durable at all, so if you drop it, you're out of luck. To elaborate on the hinge on this computer, it broke with very light usage, and I don't recommend this to anybody.::StudioDude::2.0::August 25, 2013

R189WPLOUHDWIF::Great everyday laptop, but...::I bought the Satellite C855-S5206 laptop (which is the model higher than this one, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry) about a month ago and use it for school, limited gaming and everyday computing. Fast processor and it does save a lot of energy when it come to power consumption.  My only complaint:  The "F" keys (F1-F12) in the upper row, which are also "FN" keys for things like audio and turning on/off the WiFi are NOT what you think. You have to hold the FN key to use the F1-F12 keys, instead of holding the FN key for the other commands like volume, touchpad on/off and WiFi on/of. So, those of us that are used to using "Alt+F4" to close a window, now have to push "FN+Alt+F4" which is REALLY annoying! But, other than that, it is a great machine with a long battery life even with WiFi being on.  So, 4 out of 5 stars because of the FN key row.::David Galli::4.0::October 16, 2012
R9MXDFNYD586W::As expected laptop::This is the 3rd laptop that I have purchased at Amazon over the years. I usually purchase refurbished laptops because of the price savings and have not been disappointed as yet. I got this laptop and everything on it works fine and the price was good considering the configuration.::K. Dupersoy "Caribbean King"::4.0::July 4, 2012
R195C8B946N5GQ::Great laptop value::I was waiting till I could afford a top of the line laptop, but ole Lappy went to heaven and I had to have something at once.  This was the best I could afford.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  It does everything I need and a bit more.  The keyboard seemed a bit tight, but I love the 10-key.  I have adapted.  I would still rather have spent a grand, but for a little over 400 it is great.::mistrbll::4.0::February 24, 2012
RTZNVY7UZSPC6::I will never buy Toshiba laptop again::I am one of the thousands of people who got the F3-F200-0002 error on their Toshiba laptops that are running Windows 7. This is the kiss of death. The recovery discs don't work and my only option is to send the unit back to Toshiba and wait a few weeks to see if they can figure it out.  My unit is four months old and is one of the CG55 line. Don't say you weren't warned. Good luck if you already have one of these pieces of junk.::David Amey "Older than most dirt"::1.0::January 16, 2012
R2RO9X7OKBQFOC::Super Fast and Portable::This new MacBook Air has replaced my two-year-old 13" MacBook Pro for a couple reasons. First, I wanted a more portable machine so I am not lugging around nearly five pounds of computer and second, this MacBook Air far outpaces the MacBook Pro. Sure, it doesn't have as much storage, but the SD card slot makes that a non-issue since I can use flash memory for those items that do not easily fit on the SSD hard drive (think virtual machines).For reference, look at the specifications for this machine at [...]. This is a build-to-order machine.For anyone looking to use this machine for virtualization, it works great! Running Windows 7 Professional and Windows 8 Developer editions inside Parallels Desktop, this MacBook Air returns a speed rating of 4.9 which is very reasonable for testing and demonstration purposes. That rating was returned while using Safari, Mail, Word, Excel, and Pandora within OS X simultaneously. Not too bad at all!This machine does not come with a OS X Lion recovery DVD. There is now a hidden partition that includes the parts of the OS needed to recover the full operating system via the Internet. I tired this within a Parallels virtual machine and the process works seamlessly, but does take about an hour to complete.I purchased this through Amazon from onSale and they were excellent. I had the brand-new computer in one day at about $50 less than retail.As I put more hours on my MacBook Air I will post updates. Please email me if there are specifics you want feedback on. bill dot gano at yougotbill dot com.::billgano::5.0::November 5, 2011
R3E04ER6LSAR8G::Great Deal! Good Quality Laptop::I actually purchased this item on another site for $399 after rebate w/6GB of RAM. I've had it for a couple weeks now and it works great. The performance, keyboard, and display can't be beat for the price. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the touchpad being offset due to the larger keyboard. However, it works better than any touchpad I've had including the scroll feature. I've seen similar quality on "Premium" laptops. If you can get this laptop for 400 it's a steal and I highly recommend it.::Patrick Higdon "HIG"::5.0::December 20, 2011
R3QZFWAK1H0O2V::Don't understand bad reviews... Great computer::I have owned this computer for about 2 1/2 years maybe even 3 and have never had one problem with it. It is fast and reliable. Screen is beautiful. I love mine. It is definitely way sturdier than other lap tops I have owned, I don't feel like I am going to snap the screen off when opening it like my last lap top, nothing bad to say... if your looking for an awesome lap top here you go::Lindsay::5.0::June 10, 2013
R2SW49CK9ZDKI9::Great Little Computer::I bought the Dell Inspiron to replace an older desktop model.  The file transfer utilities for Windows did a pretty good job of handling most of the program transfers although some of the applications had to be reinstalled.  Not bad all things considered.  What few gripes i had were centered around Windows, not the Dell.  The screen is sharp; start-up time is pretty fast; the key board feels good; and disk access is quick. All-in-all, this is a great little computer.::Amazon Customer::5.0::July 25, 2012
R2VRVPNVOEGGCA::Has worked just great::Quality construction. Great battery life. Good components for the price. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking. It comes with all the Dell installation disks and their support system if needed.::Norm "Amazon Aficionado"::5.0::October 4, 2013
R8OWU4LDUNYQ6::Think before you purchase it::I bought it one year back and during the warranty period I replaced hard disk, DVD drive, touchpad, keyboard and mother board 3 times. My warranty ended on 15th may and just before that I got issue in web camera. It is still in Dell depo. Dell support is denying support now. It was biggest mistake I purchased this laptop.::Shailesh Ekbote::1.0::May 23, 2013
R2B073QXBTPUB3::Nice bit of kit. No problems at all::Have had this laptop over a year now and can honestly say it hasn't had one hiccup. Used it for video and photo editing, bit of gaming and has never let me down. As long as you keep the system clean it should keep you going for years. The screen itself is vibrant and letters are nice and sharp(need to be with my eyes). Have recommended buying this laptop to my friends now and they have had no issues with theirs three having bought the same model. I am very happy with my laptop and would recommend it to anyone.::Hooper0408::5.0::April 3, 2014
R33EYW3BM5SXXH::Bad computer::I bought this in Feb. 2012. After my year was up I have had nothing but problems with this laptop. They have replaced the hard drive once, the motherboard 2 times, the lcd screen, cable, keyboard, and still having major graphics problem. It will freeze up with the screen jumping all over the place. Fixing to call again as I just got it back on Fri and it did it again so they didnt fix it. Going to bring up a lemon contract and demand another computer. This is a piece of junk. Buyers beware::teresa baker::1.0::October 20, 2013
R2YYBDG904KX9U::touchpad review::OK with everything BUT: This is supposed to be a Dell top of theline product. The touch pad is hard to press and has a "tinny"sound. The key board is of cheap materials. This is not a Mercedes.It is a Datsun! Will return.::stanley::3.0::January 16, 2013

RAQ332VAG4TQ4::frustrating, buggy, unwieldy::I bought this to replace an obsolete underpowered desktop for my home office 5 months ago, and I have probably spent 100 hours trying to get it to work right.  I bought a wireless printer at the same time - over half the time when I want to print something I have to carry the machine back into the office, plug the cable in, and re-install the wireless connection.  4 hours on the phone with a customer service rep did not solve the problem.  I have a wireless setup to my speakers (the built in speaker in the Inspiron is terrible) but I have to unplug and replug the connection every time I try to play music to get the Inspiron to transmit through it.  Even then, it occasionally cuts out.The computer came pre-loaded with lots of garbage that is very hard to get rid of - many of those extra options do not include a refusal button - Every time I reboot, I have to go to the task manager and "end task" to get the software pop-ups to leave me alone.Because of all the garbage software, it actually takes this machine twice as long to boot up and get started as the "obsolete" desktop - which I am going to reconnect tomorrow.This machine is much too large and heavy to use as a portable, and it does not work as a replacement for the desktop.  It is slow and clunky and the most frustrating computer I have ever used.Part of the problem is the current release of Windows, which exacerbates the worst features of the Inspiron.Dell used to sell a clean, functional product, but obviously that is no longer their company philosophy.  I do not intend ever to buy another Dell product.::Tyge::1.0::January 31, 2012
R3UTQXISA04G2L::bad product, bad screen::bad product, bad screen the saller dont return my money i lost money buyed it. Dell Inspiron 17R N7110 17.3" Laptop (Intel Core i7-2630QM Quad-Core Processor, 8 GB RAM, Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit)::RAMON::1.0::April 18, 2012
R1LX89F1ZQHAS7::Solid machine but finicky graphics card::I have been pleased with this laptop.  It stays relatively cool when in use and lasts quite a while on the battery supplied (I get about 4+ hours when word processing and browsing the web).  I have a slightly different model.  I have an E420 1141-A51.  This machine is not for gaming.  I have had problems with the video card drivers.  Games and some video processes have caused the system to freeze or blue screen.  After resolving these issues, I steer clear of these kinds of applications.::James Riley::4.0::July 29, 2012
RQNCRODARAL5E::Excellent::As it was my first time to buy a laptop via internet, I was little nervous. But there was no problem at all. This new laptop is working very well and I am so satisfied.::Dublin::5.0::March 18, 2012
ROQRJL7KVF0WM::Laptop::I wish this laptop had some programs on it.  I had to go out and buy program for word processing.  Ten key pad on right hand side is not same as my other laptop.  Laptop keyboard is smaller than you might think but still adequate.::farmgirl::4.0::March 28, 2013
R1ZW8RYFIYRO26::Don't Buy::I'm sharing this because I don't want others to make the same mistake I've made. When I first purchased this laptop, I was really excited. That quickly changed the moment I unwrapped the laptop from the box. I'm not sure if this is true for all Gateway W322 models or if it's just because my laptop is old, but the laptop runs extremely slowly and freezes often. The removable battery comes off frequently, so I have to tape it down. I also have to push in the power cord constantly to keep it charged. I'd suggest purchasing another laptop.::melissye::1.0::January 5, 2012
R392OK09EL7SGD::Impressed::Have had this for awhile and am just now getting around to writing a review. I got this before the latest Windows disaster came out specifically to upgrade before that. Also, wanted something with a blu-ray player. The blu-ray player feature works great and I was floored by how good the picture quality was when watching movies. The laptop is light enough and small enough that it is easy to travel with. Looking back I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend product if you can still get it with Windows 7.::NorCal_7777::5.0::July 10, 2013
RWETNW88WB0OS::Sony VAIO Laptop::This is a Win7 version of this laptop, and I love it. The apps that Sony is loading are absolutely cool, and I like the fact that now I can control my other Sony devices via this laptop (PS3 or Sony Media Player). The rest is typical, Intel i5 and BluRay. I don't think I will upgrade this to Win8, but that is another story :)::Vladimir Vojvodic::5.0::January 2, 2013
R1654DEGH5R0DD::Good price!!!::Good laptop for the price!!!! So far is working good, low fan noise, and good speed!Sound quality can use a little help but is not bad!::Raul::4.0::December 6, 2012
R18M6FGWUV3FHR::Good Laptop::This laptop is excellent for multiple use.Pros:- Excellent performance.- the backlid in the keyboard.- Good Camera.Cons:- Motion Gesture is very complicate for use.- I have little problem for use the gesture in the Touchpad.- It's little heavy.::D. Santana::4.0::November 19, 2012
R1ISSNMTOMLX9V::Compact and features galore!!::This computer is reliable, compact and lightweight with a backlit keyboard, blu-ray drive and other power house features. I expect to use this quality Sony VAIO product for years to come without having to upgrade.Great bargain!::KCSunshine::5.0::November 13, 2012
R3L6IEWBOE8ESF::Nice PC, but ......fix the touchpad!::I have always used HP laptops and have had good luck with 3 or 5 year lifespans. However, the battery performance has been terrible. So decided to make a change and purchased a Sony this time around after doing some comparing.  I don;t think the Sony is as robust as a similar DV-4 HP, but time will tell.I like the laptop. Backlit keys, large keys, simple keystroke options and sufficient ports for my use.. mainly business emails, documents, calenders etc. So far so good after 2 weeks. Battery time is showing 5+ hrs, which if it stays, will be great.One problem I also have is the touch pad. Extremely frustrating to use. Tried re-setting with no effect. I will have to contact Sony for advise. Clicking once or twice typically has NO response. I purchased a wireless mouse and have solved this problem, but only when using the mouse.  And at times, YOU NEED the touchpad, the reason it is there in the first place.::frk::4.0::October 8, 2012
RY3J3JXSZVBLX::Very Good Stylish Laptop::After reading so many review about 100s of Laptops finally i decided to go with this laptop and now i am very much satisfied.The system performance is very good, no noise, will not get heated even after running more than 24 hours(one of the review says the system gets heatedup but its not true with all Sony laptops).Display , backlit keyboard are pretty decent, gesture control needs some practice.Overall the experiance with my 1st Sony Laptop purchase is good and i would recommend any one looking for a mid range multimedia laptop.::Vasu::5.0::September 29, 2012
R2T56KBO17WENW::Good laptop::This is a good laptop. I have it for 3 weeks now and it works fine. One major issue i have with it is the touch pad. I fine i have to tap hard to navigate. This laptop surface gets easily dirty with your finger prints.Lastly , the hard drive size stated on amazon was 750Gb  but  it actually came with 679Gb  with only approximately 659Gb  free space. I guess some space was taken with the apps that it came with. But that still doesn't explain why the hard drive size was not showing 750Gb.::jessica::4.0::September 25, 2012
RR0YJMS2TQIQY::Good for its price::Good overall laptop. Gets the job done. The build of the laptop does feel a bit cheap though. Had it for a couple months, take it around with me all the time. The plastic where i rest my hands when typing is beginning to make a bit of noise. I do use it a lot though.::SxLxUxGxZ::4.0::December 6, 2012
R2YZMQN2ZQN9IX::Light, nice size!::I like the laptop and it is working well. I don't like the Windows 8! Windows 8 seems to want to make my laptop into a tablet but it can't. I need to get work done on the thing and it constantly gets in the way! I would change it to Windows 7 if I could. I might load Linux on it. I know that would be an improvement over anything Microsoft!::John P. Robinett::4.0::April 20, 2013
